        Susan Schechter, whose books about domestic violence helped to unify the movement to assist battered women and to bridge the gap between programs addressing domestic abuse and those for children's welfare, died Feb. 3 at her home in Iowa City. She was 57.
        The cause was endometrial cancer, said her husband, Allen Steinberg.
        Mrs. Schecter's 1982 book, ''Women and Male Violence: The Visions and Struggles of the Battered Women's Movement,'' a history and analysis of early efforts against domestic violence, is considered a groundbreaking work.
        Mrs. Schechter wrote ''When Love Goes Wrong'' in 1992 with Ann Jones, a journalist. The book was intended as a resource for abused women. In 1999, with Jeffrey L. Edleson, a professor at the University of Minnesota, she wrote a set of guidelines for professionals in civil courts, child welfare services and domestic violence programs.
        In her writing, Mrs. Schechter explored the ways domestic abuse affected children.
        Susan Schechter was born on May 1, 1946, in St. Louis. She received a bachelor's degree from Washington University in St. Louis and a master's degree in social work from the University of Illinois at Chicago. After graduating, she helped organize the first shelter for abused women in Chicago. In 1986, at Children's Hospital Boston, she started a program for battered women with abused children. She had been a clinical professor of social work at the University of Iowa since 1993.
        In addition to her husband, Mrs. Schechter is survived by her son, Zachary.
        Correction:  February 20, 2004, Friday  An obituary on Monday about Susan Schechter, an expert on domestic violence, misstated the title she used. She was Ms. Schechter, not Mrs. (Her husband's name was Allen Steinberg.)
