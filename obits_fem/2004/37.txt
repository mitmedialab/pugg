        Gail Hall Zarr, a former managing editor of the Zagat Surveys series of  restaurant, hotel and travel guides, died last Saturday at her home in  Manhattan. She was 50.
        The cause was complications of uterine cancer, said her husband, Gary Zarr. Mrs. Zarr began working at Zagat in 1994, rising to managing editor from senior editor. She developed new guides and oversaw the publication. ''She was responsible for more than 60 books, and was one of the key people in building our editorial group,'' said Tim Zagat, the company's publisher.
        After leaving Zagat in 2001, she wrote a Barnes & Noble guide, ''Getting Into College'' (2003).
        A 1975 graduate of New York University, Mrs. Zarr received a masters degree in English literature there in 1985. She was formerly the director of publications for the fundraising campaign at Barnard College and a public relations associate at the New York Public Library.
        She is survived by her husband; a son, Daniel; a daughter, Emily; her mother, Linda Hall of Jefferson, N.Y.; and a sister, Debra Hall of New York City.
