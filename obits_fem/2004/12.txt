        Linda Stone Davidoff, a civic activist and champion of progressive social causes who ran Elizabeth Holtzman's unsuccessful campaign for the United States Senate in New York in 1980, died on Wednesday in Tucson, Ariz. She was 62.
        The cause was pneumonia related to acute myelogenous leukemia, said her son, Daniel Kirk-Davidoff. Ms. Stone Davidoff, who lived in New York City, had gone to Tucson on a brief vacation, he said.
        Ms. Stone Davidoff was executive director of several nonprofit organizations, including, most recently, the Citizens Union, a government watchdog group based in New York. She also headed the Citizens Union Foundation, a related institution.
        She was also active in Democratic politics. In addition to Ms. Holtzman's campaign, she was for a time a manager of Ruth W. Messinger's unsuccessful campaign for mayor of New York City in 1997.
        Ms. Stone Davidoff's first marriage, to the urban planner Paul Davidoff, ended with his death in 1984. In 1997 she married Harold Stone.
        Besides Mr. Stone, she is survived by her children: Mr. Kirk-Davidoff of Takoma Park, Md., Susan Davidoff of Newton, Mass., Carla Davidoff of New Paltz, N.Y., and Thomas Davidoff of Oakland, Calif.; her stepchildren Christopher Stone of Brooklyn, Nicholas Stone of Falls Church, Va., and Rebecca Stone of Brookline, Mass.; her sisters Jean Stange of Denver and Adria Lique of Hopewell, N.J.; a brother, Richard Greenberg of Springfield, Mass.; and 12 grandchildren and step-grandchildren.
