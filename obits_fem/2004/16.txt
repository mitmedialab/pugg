        Fraydele Oysher, a star of the Yiddish theater and a member of a musical dynasty, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan, said her daughter, the singer and comedian Marilyn Michaels. She was 90.
        The daughter of a cantor, Ms. Oysher began her career as a child actress in the Yiddish theaters that once dotted Second Avenue on the Lower East Side. She starred in musicals written for her, including ''The Little Queen,'' ''The Golden Girl'' and ''Fraydele's Wedding.''
        She also specialized in one of the Yiddish theater's staple roles: the Yeshiva boy who -- it is revealed in the final, showstopping number -- is really a girl.
        ''I was cute, I was flat and I was a terrific piece of work,'' she explained in a 1996 interview with The Daily News.
        As an adult, she became one of the first women to sing cantorial music onstage, long before women were allowed to assume that role in Reform and Conservative synagogues. She also toured the United States, South America and Cuba, performing folk songs, theater songs and liturgical chants with her husband, Harold Sternberg.
        Mr. Sternberg, who appeared on Broadway in a number of George Gershwin's shows, was also a basso profundo in the Metropolitan Opera chorus for 40 years.
        Ms. Oysher's brother, Moishe, was a major star in Yiddish theater and films and a cantor known as ''the master singer of his people.''
        Fraydele Oysher was born on Oct. 3, 1913, in Lipkon, Bessarabia, which was then a Russian province. (It is now part of Moldova.)
        In addition to Ms. Michaels, who lives in Manhattan, Ms. Oysher is survived by her son, Michael Sternberg, also of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.
