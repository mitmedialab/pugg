        Therese Thau Heyman, a curator of photographs, graphic art and drawings and an expert on American photographic history, died Friday in Berkeley, Calif. She was 74.
        The cause was pneumonia, said John Cummings, associate chancellor at the University of California, Berkeley, where I. Michael Heyman, Mrs. Heyman's husband, is a former chancellor and a professor at the law school.
        Over the years, Mrs. Heyman worked at the Smithsonian Institution, the National Museum of American Art and the Oakland Museum of California. She was also on the board of the Smith College Museum of Art and on staff at the Yale Art Museum, where she was a curatorial assistant.
        She helped write or contributed to several books, including ''Dorothea Lang: American Photographs,'' ''On the Edge of America: California Modernist Art, 1900-1950'' and ''Picturing California: A Century of Photographic Genius.''
        In her career she spread awareness and appreciation of art, particularly California's photographic art. ''You often hear people say there is no American art, but this isn't so,'' she told an interviewer in 1980, according to a statement from the office of the chancellor at Berkeley.
        Mrs. Heyman was born in Manhattan and attended Smith College, where she earned a bachelor's degree in 1951, and Yale, where she graduated in 1958 with a master's degree.
        In addition to her husband, she is survived by her son James and three grandchildren.
