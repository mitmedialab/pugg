        While Sister Doris was president of the college, it grew significantly in student population and, in 1988, a master's degree program was added. Sister Doris was credited with opening the college to the surrounding community in Riverdale. N.Y. She also taught economics.
        She was the secretary for the Sisters of Charity from 1996 to 2003.

        Correction:  February 25, 2004, Wednesday  Because of an editing error, an obituary on Saturday about Sister Doris Smith, former president of the College of Mount St. Vincent in the Bronx, misstated the date of her death. It was Jan. 19, not Feb. 19.
