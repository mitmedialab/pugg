         Leslie Gourse, a prolific author best known for her biographies of a wide range of jazz musicians and singers, died on Dec. 23 at her home in Manhattan. She was 65.         The cause was respiratory problems, said her cousin Melvin Zurier.         The author or editor of more than 30 books, Ms. Gourse devoted most of her writing to profiles of jazz virtuosos, starting in 1984 with ''Louis' Children: American Jazz Singers,'' a collection of biographical sketches.         Her most notable full-length biographies included ''Unforgettable: The Life and Mystique of Nat King Cole'' (1991), ''Sassy: The Life of Sarah Vaughan'' (1993) and ''Skain's Domain: A Biography'' (1999), which she wrote with the participation of its subject, Wynton Marsalis. She later chronicled the lives of Art Blakey (2001) and Carmen McRae (2002).         The magazine Jazz Times named her biography ''Straight, No Chaser: The Life and Genius of Thelonious Monk'' (1997), one of the top jazz books of the year         Her many books for children included at least six musical surveys along the lines of her 1998 book for young adults, ''Deep Down in Music: The Art of the Great Jazz Bassists.'' She also profiled performers like Mahalia Jackson and Gloria Estefan for a series of children's books published by Franklin Watts.         Roberta Leslie Gourse was born on Jan. 1, 1939, in Fall River, Mass., and graduated from Columbia in 1960. She soon published ''With Gall and Honey,'' a novel depicting romance and self-discovery in Israel.         She is survived by her mother, Zelda Fisher Gourse, of Providence, R.I.       
         Nathalie Krassovska, a Russian-born ballerina who toured the United States for many years with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo and was known for her lyricism, died on Tuesday in Dallas. She was 86.         The cause was complications of surgery, said Natalie Skelton of the Dallas Dance Council.         Miss Krassovska was also a ballerina of the London Festival Ballet. She settled in Dallas in 1963 and helped encourage dance activities there.         A beautiful woman with luminous blue eyes, she performed the standard 19th-century repertory with both the Ballet Russe and Festival Ballet and was especially known for her ''Giselle.'' With the Ballet Russe, she also danced works by 20th-century choreographers like Michel Fokine, Léonide Massine, Bronislava Nijinska and George Balanchine.         Born in Petrograd, as St. Petersburg was then called, Miss Krassovska grew up in Western Europe and was trained in Paris and London. She appeared with the Nijinska Ballet in 1932 and Balanchine's short-lived Les Ballets 1933, but first achieved prominence in 1936 as a member of Les Ballets de Monte Carlo. There she encountered Fokine, the great reformer of 20th-century ballet, who personally coached her in many of his productions.         The Monte Carlo troupe merged in 1938 with a new organization calling itself Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. Miss Krassovska became one of its principal dancers. The group made the United States its base when World War II broke out and spent most of every year on the road.         On tour, Miss Krassovska established herself as a specialist in balletic Romanticism. She first performed the title role of ''Giselle,'' perhaps the greatest of Romantic ballets, in Montreal in 1949, prompting S. Morgan-Powell, dance critic of The Montreal Daily Star, to write, ''Her dancing was characterized by a purity of style not often seen nowadays in ballet.''         Miss Krassovska also danced some unexpected parts. Thus she had to learn tap dancing for her role as a debutante in ''The New Yorker,'' Massine's 1940 comedy inspired by cartoons in the magazine of that name.         Miss Krassovska left the Ballet Russe in 1950 to become a ballerina of London Festival Ballet, where she stayed through 1955. Of both Russian and Scottish ancestry, she danced in Great Britain under the name of Nathalie Leslie. But she returned to the Ballet Russe as guest artist under her familiar surname in the late 50's.         After moving to Dallas, she opened a school and founded a student company, Krassovska Ballet Jeunesse.       
         Geraldine Stutz, who transformed Henri Bendel from a carriage trade retailer in decline into a chic emporium of designer brands in the 1960's, died yesterday at her home in New York. She was 80.         Her death came after a long illness, said her stepdaughter, Emma Turner.         Ms. Stutz is best known for her 29-year career as the president of Henri Bendel, with a legendary eye for discovering the newest designers and using them first, installing their collections in elaborately merchandised departments that heralded the introduction of a new generation of fashion stars -- Stephen Burrows, Perry Ellis, Jean Muir, Sonia Rykiel, Carlos Falchi, Mary McFadden, Holly Harp and Ralph Lauren among them.         Many longtime Bendel shoppers recall Ms. Stutz's 1958 overhaul of the main floor at the store, at 10 West 57th Street, into a U-shaped ''Street of Shops'' widely acknowledged as a precursor to modern shop-in-shop merchandising displays. Based on her taste alone, Ms. Stutz divided merchandise into small vitrines of watches, handbags, stockings, and along one side, an inspiring ''Gilded Cage,'' a giant replica of a birdcage that housed the cosmetics department.         ''Geraldine had a vision of the kind of store she wanted to create,'' said Jean Rosenberg, who was the vice president and merchandising director at Bendel's from six months before Ms. Stutz's arrival in 1957 to their joint departure in 1986, after the store was sold to The Limited. ''It was for a particular kind of New York woman, where she could find a uniformity of taste and a certain amount of comfort in a smallish environment, where everything in one store was to her liking.''         Ms. Stutz was born in Chicago on Aug. 5, 1924. She aspired to an acting career and studied drama at Mundelein College before changing her focus to journalism. She moved to New York to be closer to the theater and found work as a fashion editor for movie magazines, and in 1947 was hired as an associate fashion editor for Glamour magazine, where she covered shoes.         Colleagues described Ms. Stutz as an industrious learner who immersed herself in the subject matter. Grace Mirabella, the former editor of Mirabella magazine, recalled an introduction to Ms. Stutz in the early 1950's, when Ms. Mirabella was working at Vogue. ''She loved to talk about the business and what was going on behind the scenes, and she knew everything about shoes,'' Ms. Mirabella said.         Ms. Stutz put her knowledge to practical use when she went to work for several footwear manufacturers, including I. Miller, the company for which Andy Warhol designed advertisements, after it was sold to the conglomerate Genesco. Maxey Jarman, its president, recognized in Ms. Stutz an ability for merchandising and advertising, and named her to run the Henri Bendel store in 1957. ''Jarman had talked to her at great length about her vision for the store,'' Ms. Rosenberg said. ''It was not going to be a store for everybody.''         Bendel's was known at various times as a hat shop and as the source of the Duke of Windsor's wardrobe, but Ms. Stutz's concept was narrowly focused on a young, sophisticated urban woman, and she rarely ordered clothes larger than size 10. In an article in New York magazine in 1987, Ms. Stutz described her taste for what she called ''dog whistle'' fashion: ''clothes with a pitch so high and special that only the thinnest and most sophisticated women would hear their call.'' She was also one of the first retailers to consider merchandising food and furniture alongside fashion, and she made way for the in-store designer boutique in the late 1960's, as she did for Ms. Rykiel.         ''She recognized that fashion was more than just about clothing; it was about lifestyle and how one lives,'' said Joan Kaner, the fashion director of Neiman Marcus, who worked under Ms. Stutz from 1967 to 1976. ''She thought to put in perfumed candles and potpourri at the entrances so that when people walked in, they got this wonderful aroma. She was born with impeccable taste, and practically brought over every European designer who ever came to America.''         Ms. Stutz's Street of Shops replaced what was formerly a dimly lit floor with merchandise randomly displayed along a 100-foot corridor. She installed marble floors and boutiques, small shops within the larger store that changed each season, stocked with exclusive merchandise culled from markets around the world -- a flower shop, stationery, a tiny art gallery, tabletop items from Frank MacIntosh, Lee Bailey's home displays, and a boutique called ''Port of Call'' with objects from Vietnam and Thailand.         Ms. Rosenberg recalled her instructions to travel to Paris to explore the new market for ready-to-wear in 1959, when Ms. Stutz told her, ''Buy anything you want.''         ''It was a store that was edited like a magazine,'' Ms. Mirabella said. ''It was everybody's meeting place on Saturdays or at Christmastime.''         Ms. Stutz took the in-store-shop concept further in the late 1960's with boutiques dedicated to the collections of designers she felt could succeed with the store's support. Stephen Burrows opened his boutique there in 1969, an experience he recalled as a defining moment of his career (one he replicated in 2002 at Bendel's current site: 712 Fifth Avenue).         In 1980, Ms. Stutz assembled a team of investors and acquired the store from Genesco. Five years later she sold her interest, and worked as a publisher with Random House, overseeing books on Andy Warhol and Elsie de Wolfe. She also continued to consult with designers and retailers through a practice called GSG Group, which she founded in 1993.         Ms. Stutz's mid-1960's marriage to David Gibbs, an art dealer and painter, ended in divorce, her stepdaughter, Ms. Turner, said.         Robert Rufino, the vice president of creative services at Tiffany & Co., is one of the many retail executives who found their start with Ms. Stutz. He designed windows for the company in the 1970's, and recalled Ms. Stutz's ability to intermingle her interests in art and film with fashion.         ''In those days, there was nothing else like Henri Bendel,'' Mr. Rufino said. ''It was like working for the best house in the world. To take this little town house and make it look like someone lived there, as you were going from room to room -- it was just one woman's vision on the world of fashion, and yet it did incredibly well.''       
         Carolyn Brady, an artist known for her large Photorealist watercolor paintings, died on May 5 at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. She was 67 and lived in New York City.         The cause was complications after heart surgery, said her dealer in New York, Nancy Hoffman.         Ms. Brady arrived at her signature style in the mid-1970's, when realism was enjoying a revival. She began painting flowers in vases, table settings and other scenes based on photographs that she took in and around her home. With their sharp focus, luminous colors and dimensions as great as 60 by 90 inches, her paintings have a hyper-realistic visual impact rarely encountered in the medium of watercolor.         Carolyn Brady was born on May 22, 1937, in Chickasha, Okla. She received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in painting from the University of Oklahoma in Norman in 1959 and went on to earn her Master of Fine Arts degree at the same school in 1961. She had her first solo exhibition in 1975 at Nancy Singer Gallery in St. Louis and the first of many New York solo shows at Nancy Hoffman Gallery in SoHo in 1977.         Ms. Brady's works are in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the National Museum of Women in the Arts, Washington; and the Art Institute of Chicago, among numerous other institutions.         Ms. Brady is survived by her husband, the sculptor Bill Epton, and her son, Alexander Brady Epton, both of New York City.       
         Ruth Laredo, a pianist equally at home in chamber music and solo works who was known for landmark recordings of Scriabin and Rachmaninoff, died on Wednesday at her apartment in New York. She was 67.         Ms. Laredo, who played her last concert on May 6 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, had cancer and died in her sleep, said her manager, James Murtha.         The concert was one of a series she had given for 17 years at the Met called ''Concerts With Commentary,'' in which Ms. Laredo played and spoke engagingly about music. The series had become an important part of the New York concert scene, where she was a frequent presence.         Just two days after the attack on the World Trade Center, Ms. Laredo celebrated the 25th anniversary of her Alice Tully Hall debut with a recital there. It was the opening concert of the 2001 Lincoln Center season, and Ms. Laredo addressed the audience beforehand, saying: ''It was important for me to play. Great music gives us spiritual sustenance and gives us hope. It is in that spirit that I play tonight.''         Ms. Laredo was a pianist in the Romantic mold, a dynamic performer concerned with texture and color. In recent years, Mr. Murtha said, her career as a soloist with orchestras had waned, but she was comfortable with a mix of recitals, chamber concerts and accompanying duties.         When she was first on the rise, in the 1970's, Ms. Laredo was a relative rarity as a female piano soloist, particularly in the technically demanding and muscular works of Rachmaninoff. There were only a few others -- Gina Bachauer, Myra Hess and later Alicia de Larrocha, for example.         ''Every time we did interviews in those early days, she was asked how does it feel to be a woman pianist,'' Mr. Murtha said. ''She wanted to be a pianist, period.''         Ruth Meckler was born in Detroit on Nov. 20, 1937. She attended the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where she studied with Rudolf Serkin. She graduated in 1960 and that same year married the violinist Jaime Laredo, with whom she collaborated musically. They later divorced. Ms. Laredo is survived by their daughter, Jennifer Laredo, who lives in London with her husband, the cellist Paul Watkins, and by a granddaughter.         Ms. Laredo made her debut with an orchestra in 1962, in a program led by Leopold Stokowski conducting the American Symphony Orchestra at Carnegie Hall. She made her debut with the New York Philharmonic, conducted by Pierre Boulez, 12 years later. Her Carnegie Hall solo recital debut came only in 1981.         At Curtis, Serkin schooled her in the basics of Mozart and Beethoven, turning a disapproving eye on her youthful love for Rachmaninoff. But it was with his music, as well as that of his fellow Russian Scriabin, that she made her mark.         In the 1970's she recorded two pioneering and acclaimed sets: the entire Scriabin piano sonatas, for the now-defunct Connoisseur label, and the complete solo repertory of Rachmaninoff, on seven LP's for CBS Masterworks.         When Ms. Laredo went to Serkin to ask if he thought she could handle the Rachmaninoff, he gave his blessing. '''You must do it' was the answer he gave me,'' Ms. Laredo said in a 1987 interview with The New York Times.         But preparing for the recordings was a fearsome and wearing task. ''I had to learn the many, many Rachmaninoff pieces that no one plays, and I found out why no one does,'' she said. ''It's because they're so hard.'' She later channeled her love for Rachmaninoff into scholarship, preparing a new edition of his piano preludes for the C.F. Peters music publisher.         The Scriabin LP's came when little of his music was available on record, and they helped spark a surge of his popularity in the United States. Ms. Laredo said that she first heard his music at a concert of Vladimir Horowitz and was dazzled.         Bernard Holland, a Times music critic, wrote of her playing of Scriabin's music: ''Ms. Laredo's sensuous, beautifully controlled playing caught its mad and slightly evil quality.''         Correction:  June 17, 2005, Friday  An obituary of the classical pianist Ruth Laredo on May 27 referred imprecisely to the label that issued her recordings of the Scriabin piano sonatas in 1970. It is Connoisseur Society, not Connoisseur, and it remains in business.       
         Elizabeth Blodgett Hall, an educator who concluded that bored high school students should be sent straight to college and started Simon's Rock College to prove the point, died on Monday in Canaan, Conn. She was 95.         Her death was announced by Judith Monachina, spokeswoman for the college, in Great Barrington, Mass., which is now part of Bard College. Mrs. Hall, as the headmistress of a girls' prep school, perceived that adolescents were maturing faster than in the past, and that high schools were not meeting the challenge. So in 1964, she began what she called ''an early college'' for young women. Students who otherwise would have been in the last two years of high school instead took the first two years of college.         Leon Botstein, president of Bard, explained in an interview that Mrs. Hall abhorred the way adolescents were ''infantilized,'' when they were capable of doing high-level academic work. He said that her ideas had been adopted by more and more colleges, and that Bard itself had intensified its ''early-college'' efforts by beginning a high school in New York City in 2001 to teach college-level courses.         The later Bard program received funds from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has also given millions to other early college programs on the theory they will help reduce dropout rates. Tom Vander Ark, executive director of the foundation's education program, credited Mrs. Hall's inspiration.         Mrs. Hall's mission was intensely personal. In addition to spending more than $6 million of her own, she gave 200 acres of her family's farmland, buildings included, to start the college, which became coeducational in 1970. She named it for a rock on which she had played as a child.         Elizabeth Blodgett was born in Manhattan on Nov. 16, 1909. Her father made a fortune in the chewing gum industry.         She later attended public and private schools in the Great Barrington area. She graduated from Miss Hall's School in Pittsfield, Mass., in 1928, and then attended Knox College for a year.         In 1930, she married Livingston Hall, who was later a professor and administrator at Harvard Law School. After having four children, she entered Radcliffe College, one of the first adults to do so, and graduated in 1946.         After holding several other jobs, she became head of the history department, then headmistress, at the Concord Academy, a private girls' school in Concord, Mass. An article in Mademoiselle in 1969 said she turned ''a genteel finishing school'' into ''one of the most dynamic girls' preparatory schools in the East.''         It was a time when educators were scrambling to jump-start education to keep up with the Russians, in space and elsewhere. Initiatives ranged from Advanced Placement courses that allowed students to do college-credit work while still in high school to the experimental admissions of bright high school students.         Earlier, in the 1930's, Robert Maynard Hutchins, president of the University of Chicago and a philosopher of education, had admitted academically superior 16-year-olds as freshmen. European universities had long allowed such acceleration.         What Mrs. Hall was doing was different in that she established a residential college expressly for high school aged students, putting it somewhere between a prep school and a college, with resultant tensions. For example, students complained about rules forbidding overnight room visits by members of the opposite sex.         There have been accusations over the years between the students and the administration as the college sought to find ways to restrict students' behavior without being harsh.         Mrs. Hall faced frequent criticism from both faculty and students. In an interview with Berkshire Week in 1988, she recalled that she fought against ''self-pity'' before resigning, partly as a result of such criticism, in 1972 . She remained a trustee.         Mrs. Hall's husband died in 1995. She is survived by her sons, Thomas Livingston Hall of San Francisco, and John Kendrick Hall of Jerusalem; her daughters, Margaret Hall Whitfield Courant of Great Barrington and Elizabeth Hall Richardson of Denver; 11 grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren.         Correction:  July 21, 2005, Thursday  An obituary yesterday about Elizabeth Blodgett Hall, who founded Simon's Rock College, now part of Bard College, referred incorrectly in some copies to the given name of the president of Bard, who commented on her legacy. He is Leon Botstein, not Leo.       
         Edith I. Spivack, a tireless lawyer who worked for the New York City Law Department from 1934, when few other women were government lawyers, until last year, when she reluctantly stopped showing up four days a week, died on Tuesday at St. Francis Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y. She was 95.         The cause was complications of a fall, a daughter, Amy Bass, said.         The Law Department, New York City's legal advocate, has 650 lawyers, making it the third largest law firm in the city and one of the largest in the country. Having served 10 mayors and 23 corporation counsels, Ms. Spivack was by far the longest-serving civil servant in the department and quite possibly in the city.         A colleague, Jeffrey Friedlander, the first assistant corporation counsel, said that Ms. Spivack's formal expertise was tax law. But, he added, her wide-ranging legal knowledge, administrative ability and extensive institutional memory were ''the support behind the men who had the titles.''         Indeed, if Ms. Spivack had been born a man, Mr. Friedlander said, she would not have worked in obscurity for the many decades that she did.         ''She was, essentially, the power behind the throne,'' he said. ''It was clear she was the brains.''         Her most important legal work came in the 1970's, when she was well into her 60's. She helped negotiate loans to keep the city out of bankruptcy. In the Penn Central Railroad bankruptcy, she helped collect many millions of dollars in real estate taxes. She successfully argued a major tax case, Walz v. Tax Commission, before the Supreme Court.         Short, small-boned, impeccably dressed, with a courtly manner from another era, she had a tart wit.         At a Christmas party last year at which Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg awarded her a public service plaque, the mayor tried to make small talk and asked when she graduated from college. Ms. Spivack replied that she graduated from Barnard College in 1929.         The mayor said his mother had graduated from New York University in the same year. Ms. Spivack looked at the mayor and said, ''Well, I guess she couldn't get into Barnard.''         Ms. Spivack was born on April 19, 1910. She grew up in the Bronx and the Upper West Side, the daughter of a seller of cardboard boxes.         After graduating from Barnard at 19, she went to Columbia Law School. She married a fellow student, Bernard H. Goldstein, who died in 1998. She retained her maiden name as a tribute to her parents.         She is survived by Ms. Bass of Port Washington; another daughter, Rita Christopher Frank of Madison, Conn.; and four grandchildren.         Ms. Spivack was rejected by law firms, in part because of the Great Depression, but also, she maintained, because she was a woman and Jewish. When Fiorello H. La Guardia took office in 1934, political appointees were removed and replaced through civil service examination.         Told that the city had no money to pay her, Ms. Spivack worked in the Law Department as a volunteer and was finally hired at half salary: $1,700 a year.         In January 1980, the city began to force foreign consulates to pay their municipal water bills, but the consul general of Colombia refused.         After many telephone calls, she left a message: ''If a check is not delivered this afternoon to the corporation counsel's office, I'm coming up personally to shut off the water.'' The check arrived.         In the 1980's, Ms. Spivack took advantage of the elimination of mandatory retirement and continued to work until 1995, when she officially retired. After three weeks she returned to the department in an advisory capacity.         ''My mom didn't knit, never cooked, never drove,'' Ms. Bass said. ''She never typed. My mom was a professional woman, a professional lawyer.''         After the Penn Central bankruptcy, her efforts recovered $90 million in back taxes. ''For some reason, Penn Central made out the $90 million check directly to me,'' she recalled later. ''But being an honest woman, I handed it over to the city.''       
         Hildegarde, whose career as an international cabaret chanteuse spanned almost seven decades and who was credited with starting the single-name vogue among entertainers, died on Friday at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital. She was 99.         Her death was confirmed yesterday by her longtime friend and manager, Don Dellair.         A regal figure in couturier gowns, jeweled glasses, glittering earrings and, in her later years, a curly platinum wig, Hildegarde influenced a number of other performers. She accompanied herself on the piano, always in her trademark long white gloves, and, fluttering a lace handkerchief, chatted between numbers, often poking fun at herself.         ''Hildegarde was perhaps the most famous supper-club entertainer who ever lived,'' Liberace once said. ''I used to absorb all the things she was doing, all the showmanship she created. It was marvelous to watch her, wearing elegant gowns, surrounded with roses and playing with white gloves on. They used to literally roll out the red carpet for her.''         Although Liberace said he was careful not to imitate her, he did take a single stage name and used ''I'll Be Seeing You,'' one of her best-known numbers, as his own theme song.         Usually billed as the Incomparable Hildegarde, an orchid bestowed on her by Walter Winchell, she was at the peak of her popularity in the 1930's and 40's, when she was booked in plush hotel cabaret rooms and supper clubs at least 45 weeks a year. At one engagement in 1946, she was paid $17,500 a week and 50 percent of the gross over $80,000. She was on the cover of Life magazine in 1939, had a top 10 radio show and traveled with her own orchestra and several dozen pieces of luggage.         Her recordings of such songs as ''Darling, Je Vous Aime Beaucoup,'' ''The Last Time I Saw Paris'' and ''Lili Marlene'' became worldwide hits. Revlon introduced a Hildegarde shade of lipstick and nail polish, a nursery named a rose for her, and a linen company, picking up on the way she signed her autograph, introduced a ''Bless You'' handkerchief.         Hildegarde's admirers ranged from enlisted men and officers during World War II to King Gustaf of Sweden and the Duke of Windsor. In 1961 she was the guest of honor at a gala at which Eleanor Roosevelt presented her with an award naming her First Lady of the Supper Clubs.         From the 1950's through the 70's, in addition to her cabaret appearances and record albums, she appeared in a number of television specials and toured with the national company of the Stephen Sondheim musical ''Follies.'' Her autobiography, ''Over 50  So What!'' was published by Doubleday in 1961. In 1980, she was in a revival of the 1927 musical ''The Five O'Clock Girl'' at the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Conn., and took part in a tour of ''The Big Broadcast of 1944,'' which recreated radio programs of that year. She also did a number of lecture tours at universities and auditoriums, singing, playing, chatting and answering questions.         Born Hildegarde Loretta Sell in Adell, Wis., to German immigrant parents, she began her career in Milwaukee at the age of 16 when, as a music student at Marquette University, she played the piano in a silent movie house. In 1928 she joined a vaudeville troupe, toured for two seasons and then spent a year as an accompanist to various performers. She arrived in New York by way of Camden, N.J., where she struck up a friendship with Anna Sosenko, her landlady's daughter and a budding songwriter, who became the architect of her career.         ''Anna was determined to be a songwriter,'' Hildegarde recalled. ''She made me go with her to New York to sing her work to publishers.'' For a time, Hildegarde took a job as a song plugger for Irving Berlin. She emerged as the one-name Hildegarde after an audition with Gus Edwards, the impresario, who suggested she lose her surname. Ms. Sosenko became her business manager and the two traveled, lived and collected art together for 23 years.         Ms. Sosenko wrote ''Darling, Je Vous Aime Beaucoup,'' which became Hildegarde's signature song, and was the singer's partner until 1955, when the relationship dissolved. The friendship resumed two decades later.         Although most of her career was in the United States, Hildegarde was engaged to appear at the Café de Paris in London when she was in her early 20's. She was not a great success, but the experience led her and Ms. Sosenko to take off for Paris to learn the art of cabaret.         They remained there for three years. Ms. Sosenko helped her perfect her technique, and she acquired an international flavor by learning to sing in French, Russian, Italian and Swedish. She also developed the precise diction that made every word clear and reduced her slight German accent.         Her name became synonymous with the best clubs on both sides of the Atlantic. In 1934, she sang at the Ritz Hotel in London during the Duke of Kent's wedding festivities. The next year she was back for King George V's jubilee, and she returned in 1937 for King George VI's coronation. She also appeared in several British movies and stage revues.         During the zenith of her career in the 40's, Hildegarde's name appeared on best-dressed lists, and people were stunned when she said she spent $10,000 a year on clothes. By the 60's, the sum had risen to $30,000.         ''I rarely look back, '' she said as she approached 90. ''That's part of the secret of staying young.''         She leaves no immediate survivors, her manager, Mr. Dellair, said.         During a 1993 performance at Manhattan's Algonquin Hotel, Hildegarde said: ''Wrinkle, wrinkle, leave me alone. Go and sliver Sharon Stone.''         ''I can't imagine myself not performing,'' she said in 1995. ''I like to be in harness. I'm good, I know I'm good, and I'm ready.''         Another cabaret legend, Bobby Short, who died this year at 80, once said, ''Hers was the slickest nightclub act of all time.''       
         Hildegarde, whose career as an international cabaret chanteuse spanned almost seven decades and who was credited with starting the single-name vogue among entertainers, died on Friday at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital. She was 99.         Her death was confirmed Saturday by her longtime friend and manager, Don Dellair.         A regal figure in couture gowns, jeweled glasses, glittering earrings and, in her later years, a curly platinum wig, Hildegarde influenced a number of performers. She accompanied herself on the piano, always in her trademark long white gloves, and, fluttering a lace handkerchief, chatted between numbers, often poking fun at herself.         ''Hildegarde was perhaps the most famous supper-club entertainer who ever lived,'' Liberace once said. ''I used to absorb all the things she was doing, all the showmanship she created. It was marvelous to watch her, wearing elegant gowns, surrounded with roses and playing with white gloves on. They used to literally roll out the red carpet for her.''         Although Liberace said he was careful not to imitate her, he did take a single stage name and used ''I'll Be Seeing You,'' one of her best-known numbers, as his theme song.         Usually billed as the Incomparable Hildegarde, an orchid bestowed on her by Walter Winchell, she was at the peak of her popularity in the 1930's and 40's, when she was booked in plush hotel cabaret rooms and supper clubs at least 45 weeks a year. At one engagement in 1946, she was paid $17,500 a week and 50 percent of the gross over $80,000. She was on the cover of Life magazine in 1939, had a Top 10 radio show and traveled with her own orchestra and several dozen pieces of luggage.         Her recordings of such songs as ''Darling, Je Vous Aime Beaucoup,'' ''The Last Time I Saw Paris'' and ''Lili Marlene'' became worldwide hits. Revlon introduced a Hildegarde shade of lipstick and nail polish, a nursery named a rose for her, and a linen company, picking up on the way she signed her autograph, introduced a ''Bless You'' handkerchief.         Hildegarde's admirers ranged from enlisted men and officers during World War II to the Duke of Windsor. In 1961 she was the guest of honor at a gala at which Eleanor Roosevelt presented her with an award naming her First Lady of the Supper Clubs.         From the 1950's through the 70's, in addition to working in cabaret and recording albums, she appeared in a number of television specials and toured with the national company of the Stephen Sondheim musical ''Follies.'' Her autobiography, ''Over 50  So What!'' was published by Doubleday in 1963. She was in a 1979 revival of the 1927 musical ''The Five O'Clock Girl'' at the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Conn., and took part in a tour of ''The Big Broadcast of 1944,'' which recreated radio programs of that year. She also did a number of lecture tours at universities and auditoriums, singing, playing, chatting and answering questions.         Born Hildegarde Loretta Sell in Adell, Wis., to German immigrant parents, she began her career in Milwaukee at the age of 16 when, as a music student at Marquette University, she played the piano in a silent movie house. In 1928 she joined a vaudeville troupe, toured for two seasons and then spent a year as an accompanist to various performers. She arrived in New York by way of Camden, N.J., where she struck up a friendship with Anna Sosenko, her landlady's daughter and a budding songwriter, who became the architect of her career.         ''Anna was determined to be a songwriter,'' Hildegarde once said. ''She made me go with her to New York to sing her work to publishers.'' For a time, Hildegarde took a job as a song plugger for Irving Berlin. She emerged as the one-name Hildegarde after an audition with Gus Edwards, the impresario, who suggested she lose her surname.Sosenko became her business manager and the two traveled, lived and collected art together for 23 years.         Sosenko wrote ''Darling, Je Vous Aime Beaucoup,'' which became Hildegarde's signature song, and was the singer's partner until 1955, when the relationship dissolved. The friendship resumed two decades later.         Although most of her career was in the United States, Hildegarde was engaged to appear at the Café de Paris in London when she was in her early 20's. She was not a great success, but the experience led her and Sosenko to take off for Paris to learn the art of cabaret.         They remained there for three years. Sosenko helped her perfect her technique, and she acquired an international flavor by learning to sing in French, Russian, Italian and Swedish. She also developed the precise diction that made every word clear and reduced her slight German accent.         Her name became synonymous with the best clubs on both sides of the Atlantic. In 1934, she sang at the Ritz Hotel in London during the Duke of Kent's wedding festivities. The next year she was back for King George V's jubilee, and she returned in 1937 for King George VI's coronation. She also appeared in several British movies and stage revues.         During the zenith of her career in the 40's, Hildegarde's name appeared on best-dressed lists, and people were stunned when she said she spent $10,000 a year on clothes. By the 60's, the sum had risen to $30,000.         ''I rarely look back,'' she said as she approached 90. ''That's part of the secret of staying young.''         She leaves no immediate survivors, her manager, Mr. Dellair, said.         During a 1993 performance at Manhattan's Algonquin Hotel, Hildegarde said: ''Wrinkle, wrinkle, leave me alone. Go and sliver Sharon Stone.''         ''I can't imagine myself not performing,'' she said in 1995. ''I like to be in harness. I'm good, I know I'm good, and I'm ready.''         Another cabaret legend, Bobby Short, who died this year at 80, once said, ''Hers was the slickest nightclub act of all time.''       
         Barbara Bel Geddes, a critically acclaimed stage, screen and television actress known for her work with Alfred Hitchcock in the 1950's and, more recently, for her role as Miss Ellie, the matriarch of the fractious Ewing clan on the long-running nighttime soap opera ''Dallas,'' died on Monday at her home in Northeast Harbor, Me. She was 82.         The Jordan-Fernald Funeral Home in Mount Desert, Me., confirmed the death to The Associated Press, giving no cause. The San Francisco Chronicle reported yesterday that Ms. Bel Geddes had died of lung cancer.         On Broadway Ms. Bel Geddes was best known as the original Maggie the Cat in Tennessee Williams's ''Cat on Hot Tin Roof,'' which opened in 1955. She also appeared in ''The Moon Is Blue'' (1951) and ''Silent Night, Lonely Night'' (1959). Her film credits include Hitchcock's ''Vertigo'' (1958); ''Caught'' (1949), directed by Max Ophüls; and ''Panic in the Streets'' (1950), directed by Elia Kazan.         On television Ms. Bel Geddes starred in several episodes of Hitchcock's weekly series ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents'' during the late 1950's and early 1960's. In 1980 she won the Emmy Award for best actress in a dramatic series for her role on ''Dallas.''         Blond, soft-spoken and slightly plump as a young woman, Ms. Bel Geddes projected a resolute, even steely, intelligence beneath her cherubic exterior. It was a quality Hitchcock used to great effect, notably in ''Vertigo,'' in which Ms. Bel Geddes played Midge, the steadfast, unglamorous ex-fiancée of Jimmy Stewart, who watches his painful descent into obsession and madness.         Hitchcock used her memorably again in ''Lamb to the Slaughter,'' widely considered one of the finest episodes of ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents.'' Broadcast in the spring of 1958, it starred Ms. Bel Geddes as a wife who murders her philandering husband by bludgeoning him with a frozen leg of lamb. When detectives show up to investigate the death, the murder weapon is nowhere to be found. Ms. Bel Geddes, smiling a tiny, knowing smile, sits them down to a home-cooked meal.         Barbara Bel Geddes was born in New York on Oct. 31, 1922. Her father was Norman Bel Geddes, the architect and stage designer. She made her Broadway debut in 1941 in the forgettable play ''Out of the Frying Pan.'' She went on to win a Theater World Award in 1946 for her performance in ''Deep Are the Roots,'' which Kazan directed.         Soon afterward, Ms. Bel Geddes went to Hollywood, where she starred opposite Henry Fonda in her first film, ''The Long Night'' (1947). Although she was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance as Katrin Hanson, the daughter of Norwegian immigrants in ''I Remember Mama'' (1948), Ms. Bel Geddes made relatively few movies, working primarily in theater and television. Her other film credits include ''Blood on the Moon'' (1948), ''Fourteen Hours'' (1951) and ''The Five Pennies'' (1959).         Ms. Bel Geddes's greatest critical acclaim came as Maggie, the restless young wife in a decaying family of Mississippi planters in ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.'' Reviewing her performance in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson called it ''vital, lovely and frank.''         Her other Broadway credits include ''The Living Room'' (1954), by Graham Greene; ''The Sleeping Prince'' (1956), by Terence Rattigan; and ''Mary, Mary'' (1961), by Jean Kerr.         Ms. Bel Geddes appeared on ''Dallas'' in two installments, the first from 1978 to 1984, when she retired after heart surgery. She was replaced as Miss Ellie by Donna Reed, who sued to retain the role after the show's producers reinstated Ms. Bel Geddes in 1985. Ms. Reed lost her bid, and Ms. Bel Geddes remained in the role until 2000.         Ms. Bel Geddes's first marriage, to Carl Schreuer, an engineer, ended in divorce. Her second husband, Windsor Lewis, a theater director, died before her. She is survived by a daughter, Susan, from her first marriage, and a daughter, Betsy, from her second.         In addition to acting, Ms. Bel Geddes also worked as a professional artist. She wrote and illustrated two children's books, ''I Like to Be Me'' (Viking, 1963) and ''So Do I'' (Arbor House, 1972).         Looking back on her career, Ms. Bel Geddes expressed amusement that she was so often cast as patricians. ''They're always making me play well-bred ladies,'' she told People magazine in 1982. She added, ''I'm not very well bred, and I'm not much of a lady.''         Correction:  August 13, 2005, Saturday  An obituary of the actress Barbara Bel Geddes on Thursday misstated the year of her final appearance on the television show ''Dallas.'' It was 1990, not 2000. A picture caption referred incorrectly to the character she played. It was Miss Ellie, not Ms. Ellie.       
         Toni Trent Parker, an author who helped advance the cause of books featuring African-American children, died on Thursday at her home in Stamford, Conn. She was 58.         The cause was a brain tumor, her family said.         To increase the visibility of black children in children's books, Ms. Parker and two friends, Donna Rand and Sheila Foster, established a company to help promote such books and later wrote a series of four guides, ''Black Books Galore! Guide to Great African American Children's Books.'' The guides, first published in 1998 by John Wiley & Sons, are available at www.blackbooksgalore.com.         Children's picture books featuring or including minority children were largely absent before the 1960's, when the first few were published and authors and other advocates began criticizing what they viewed as prejudice in the publishing industry, said Leonard S. Marcus, a book reviewer for Parenting magazine.         By promoting sales, raising awareness and adding to the literature, Ms. Parker helped bring more books with black children into the mainstream, he said.         In 1998 she established Kids Cultural Books, a nonprofit organization that holds book festivals around the country to bring multicultural books and their authors together with children. The organization received a grant from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation in 2000.         Ms. Parker wrote six children's picture books, including holiday books and a keepsake book, all picturing black children. Her most recent title, ''Sienna's Scrapbook'' (Chronicle Books, 2005), portrays an young African-American girl and her family visiting black cultural and historical sites in the United States.         Toni Trent Parker was born in 1947 in Winston-Salem, N.C. She earned a bachelor's degree in history from Oberlin College in 1970, and did graduate work at the University of California, Berkeley.         Ms. Parker is survived by her husband, Judge Barrington D. Parker Jr. of Stamford, who is on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit; their daughters, Christine, Kathleen and Jennifer, all of Stamford; her mother, Viola Trent of Greensboro, N.C.; and two sisters, Kay Holloway of Potomac, Md., and Judy Scales-Trent of Buffalo, N.Y.       
         Sara Levi-Tanai, the choreographer and founding director of Inbal Dance Theater, whose pioneering mix of Yemenite Jewish traditions and contemporary dance long made it Israel's premier dance company, died on Monday in Ramat Gan, Israel. She was 94.         Her death was announced by Chaim Shiran, Inbal's director general, The Jerusalem Post said.         Judith Brin Ingber, an American expert on Jewish dance history, said that Ms. Levi-Tanai had been living until recently in the Tel Aviv suburb of Kfar Saba before transferring to a hospital in Ramat Gan.         Founded in 1950, Inbal caused a sensation on its early tours in Europe and in the United States largely because the Yemenite rituals and folk customs Ms. Levi-Tanai theatricalized so vibrantly were a revelation to both Jewish and non-Jewish audiences in the West. So strong was this impact that the American choreographers Jerome Robbins and Anna Sokolow went to Israel several times in the early 1950's to help Ms. Levi-Tanai professionalize the company further.         At its United States debut in New York in January 1958, John Martin, dance critic of The New York Times, described a staging of a Yemenite wedding and Ms. Levi-Tanai's biblical dance dramas as ''retold almost as ritualistic re-experiencing'' and added, ''The greatness of Inbal today, as of our own modern dance of yesterday, is its 'soul' and not its forms.''         Unlike the Jewish population that was airlifted to Israel in 1949 from Yemen, its centuries-old home, Ms. Levi-Tanai was descended from Yemenite Jews who lived for generations under Ottoman rule near Tel Aviv and in Jerusalem. She was born in 1911 in Jerusalem.         In founding Inbal, which means ''tongue of the bell'' in Hebrew, she set out to have the Yemenite Jewish heritage resonate both as part of Israeli culture as a whole and as a distinctive heritage to be preserved.         As many observers pointed out, Ms. Levi-Tanai was not trained in dance. As a child, she was placed in an orphanage by her father after her mother and sisters died in an epidemic during World War I. She later attended a boarding school in the Shfeya Youth Village, studied music and trained to be a kindergarten teacher.         During World War II she organized holiday pageants at the Kibbutz Ramat Hakovesh. Teaching at the Tel Aviv Seminary for Music Teachers in 1948 and 1949, she joined forces with the Israeli composer Ovadia Tuvia and the Yemenite young people who sang in his chorales. Earlier she had studied at Habimah, the famed theater company, and married Israel Tanai. When she met the new immigrants from Yemen, she used the singers as the nucleus for the Sara Levi-Tanai Company in 1949, which became Inbal.         With her strong musical and theatrical values as well as an innate poetic sense, she knew how to make a signature piece like ''Yemenite Wedding'' a classic that remained in the repertory on the company's later tours, including New York in 2002.         In 1991 she was ousted as artistic director of Inbal, and the company was eventually made part of a larger organization, the Inbal Interdisciplinary Ethnic Center. Ms. Levi-Tanai then toured with a program, ''Who Kissed Me,'' in which she joined two singer-dancers as a narrator. She was the subject of a documentary, ''Bare Feet.''         Ms. Levi-Tanai is survived by a daughter, Michal, and a son, Yaacov, and several grandchildren and great grandchildren.         ''Sara used her artistry to create a unique contemporary dance company,'' Ms. Ingber, the dance historian, said on Wednesday. ''The magic of the Yemenite Jewish performers is their multi view. They are wonderful dancers, singers, drummers. That is how they celebrate and that is what Sara brought to the stage.''       
         Shirley Horn, a jazz singer and pianist who drew audiences close with a powerfully confidential, vibratoless delivery, died yesterday at a nursing home in Cheverly, Md. She was 71. Her death was announced by Regina Joskow, vice president of publicity at the Verve Music Group, Ms. Horn's label.         Ms. Horn was a unique singer, with one of the slowest deliveries in jazz and a very unusual way of phrasing, putting stress on certain words and letting others slip away. She cherished her repertory, making audiences feel that she was cutting through to the stark truths of songs like ''Here's to Life'' and ''You Won't Forget Me.'' She wanted things just so: she stuck with her drummer, Steve Williams, for 23 years, and her bassist, Charles Ables -- who died in 2002 -- for 33.         She lived all her life in and around Washington, often performing close to home to be near her family. But over the last two decades she enjoyed a quietly expanding revival of the concert and club career she had begun in the 1950's, and she became a star in the jazz world.         When she was 4, her mother had her start piano lessons. In her teens she won a scholarship to Juilliard, but it was decided that living in New York would cost the family too much money; she studied classical music at Howard University in Washington instead.         She recalled that at 17, while she was playing classical music at a restaurant in Washington, a man appeared in front of her with a four-foot-tall turquoise teddy bear. ''If you sing 'Melancholy Baby,''' he said, ''I'll give you this bear.'' She did, and he did.         At the time Ms. Horn was shy and largely focused on classical music, but she often cited this as the moment when it dawned on her that if she overcame her reluctance to sing and to play jazz in public, she might be able to make a living at it. About her transition from classical to jazz, she liked to say: ''I loved Rachmaninoff, but then Oscar Peterson became my Rachmaninoff. And Ahmad Jamal became my Debussy.''         From 1954, she led her own jazz trio in Washington. In 1960 she recorded her first album, ''Embers and Ashes,'' for a small label called Stere-o-Craft. It was not widely heard, but Miles Davis heard it, and a year later he tracked down her telephone number in Washington and invited her to open for him at the Village Vanguard in New York. That exposure, plus the help of the jazz agent and manager John Levy, helped get her a contract with Mercury Records.         Mercury signed Ms. Horn as a singer, not a singer-pianist. Although some of the great piano-playing accompanists, including Hank Jones and Jimmy Jones, were hired to play on her records, and although ''Loads of Love,'' from 1962, showcased her voice well -- she could sound like a quieter, subtler version of Dinah Washington -- the situation made her uncomfortable.         By the mid-1960's she had stopped touring and decided to restrict her performing to the Washington and Baltimore areas so she could spend more time at home raising her daughter, Rainy. From 1963 to 1978 she made only two records -- ''Travelin' Light'' for ABC-Paramount and ''Where Are You Going?'' for Perception. From 1978 to 1984, she recorded for the Danish label Steeplechase and slowly came back into the awareness of jazz fans.         In 1982, she played her first New York performance in more than 15 years, at Michael's Pub, and in 1986 she was signed by Verve. The company built up her career all over again over the course of 11 albums, including ''You Won't Forget Me'' (1990), which featured guest appearances by Miles Davis and Wynton Marsalis; ''I Remember Miles'' (1998), which won a Grammy Award; and a few that featured string sections.         Ms. Horn's survivors include her husband, Sheppard Deering, of Upper Marlboro, Md.; her daughter, Rainy Smith, of Maryland; and several grandchildren.         Ms. Horn had been fighting breast cancer for some time when complications of diabetes led to the amputation of her right foot in 2002. For a few years she performed sitting in a chair and facing the audience directly, away from the piano, which was played by George Mesterhazy. But in her final performances in New York, a two-week stretch at Le Jazz Au Bar that started last Dec. 30, she was back at the piano again, with the help of a prosthetic device that helped her to use the instrument's sustain pedal.         Three of those performances will be released in October on a Verve anthology of her work, ''But Beautiful: The Best of Shirley Horn.''       
         Ruth Clement Bond, an educator and civic leader who in the mid-1930's, in her first and only foray into quilt design, helped transform the American quilt from a utilitarian bedcovering into a work of avant-garde social commentary, died on Oct. 24 at her daughter's home in Manhattan. She was 101.         Her death was confirmed by her family.         Mrs. Bond was noted for a series of quilts known collectively as the T.V.A. quilts. Designed by her, the quilts were sewn in rural Alabama by the wives of African-American workers building dams there for the Tennessee Valley Authority. Visually arresting and contemporary-looking even today, the T.V.A. quilts are considered pivotal in the history of American quiltmaking.         While most quilts of the period were based on the traditional geometric and floral designs that had endured for more than a century, the T.V.A. quilts are dynamic works of modern art. Using solid-colored fabrics appliquéd onto stark backgrounds, they depict bold, stylized silhouettes of black people. With their jagged yet elegant lines, the figures have been compared to the paper cutouts of Matisse and to the work of the Harlem Renaissance painter Aaron Douglas.         Mrs. Bond, who had trained as an academic and did not know how to quilt, embarked on the project after her husband was sent to northern Alabama to supervise the black workers at the dam sites there. The Bonds lived for a time near the Wheeler Dam, in one of the segregated villages built for the workers and their families.         The women completed a half-dozen large quilts, all believed to have been made in 1934. Three are extant, as are several very small quilts, made as samples.         The T.V.A. quilts have been exhibited in New York at the Museum of Arts and Design, and elsewhere around the country. They are featured in several books, among them ''Soft Covers for Hard Times: Quiltmaking and the Great Depression'' (Rutledge Hill Press, 1990), by Merikay Waldvogel.         In later years, Mrs. Bond, whose husband joined the Foreign Service in 1944, taught at universities in Haiti, Liberia and Malawi and worked with women's and youth groups in Afghanistan, Tunisia and Sierra Leone. After returning to Washington in the 1960's, she served as president of the African-American Women's Association.         In 1978, Mrs. Bond was part of a fact-finding mission for the National Council of Negro Women that studied the role of women in Senegal, Togo and the Ivory Coast.         Ruth Elizabeth Clement was born in Louisville, Ky., on May 22, 1904, the fourth of seven children of a prominent black family. Her father, George, was a bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church. Her mother, the former Emma Williams, was, in 1946, the first black woman to be named American Mother of the Year.         Ruth received bachelor's and master's degrees in English literature from Northwestern University and was afterward the head of the English department at Kentucky State College.         In 1931, she married J. Max Bond and followed him to the University of Southern California, where he earned a doctorate in sociology. Mrs. Bond also started work on a Ph.D., but left after the birth of her first child. Mr. Bond later took a position with the T.V.A., becoming the highest-ranking black administrator there.         Mr. Bond died in 1991. Mrs. Bond is survived by their three children, Jane Clement Bond and J. Max Bond Jr., both of Manhattan, and George Clement Bond of Teaneck, N.J.; a sister, Emma Clement Walker, of Seattle; six grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.         When Mrs. Bond joined her husband in Alabama, she planned to finish her doctoral studies, but there was no local university at which she could enroll. So, while her husband trained the builders, she went to work with their wives in the makeshift villages along the Tennessee River.         Many of the workers were former sharecroppers, and the dam project gave them their first real income. Almost overnight, their wives were buying pianos for their parlors. But to Mrs. Bond's consternation, they were wallpapering those parlors with the pages of the Sears catalog.         ''These country women were buying things they didn't need, yet weren't fixing up their houses,'' she said in 1992, in an oral history for the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training.         Mrs. Bond started a home beautification program, helping the women make curtains from dyed feed sacks and rugs from cornhusks. Many of the women were expert quilters, and she began designing pictorial quilts that celebrated black Americans' expanded opportunities under the New Deal. Mrs. Bond cut the pattern pieces out of paper and chose the colors; the women pieced and quilted the cotton fabric.         One quilt depicts a man torn between an alluring woman, tantalizingly glimpsed at one edge of the image, and a solid government job, represented by an extended uniformed arm, at the other.         Another shows a black fist seeming to rise straight from the earth. The fist clutches a jagged red lightning bolt, symbolizing the T.V.A.'s promise of rural electrification.         The women called the quilt ''Black Power.''       
         Catherine M. Pessino, a naturalist and educator who spent more than three decades introducing young people to wildlife in the most inhospitable of places -- the sidewalks, sewers and catchment basins of New York City -- died on Nov. 5 in Mount Vernon, N.Y. She was 80.         Her death was announced by the Great Gull Island Committee, a conservation group of which Ms. Pessino was a past chairwoman. She was also on the staff of the American Museum of Natural History for many years.         In 1954, Ms. Pessino helped found the museum's first natural science center for children, directing it through several incarnations. The center still offers classes for children and families.         She was also known for her intensive studies of terns on Great Gull Island, a bird sanctuary off the eastern tip of Long Island. Her work there helped bring thousands of the birds back to the island to nest.         Catherine Mary Pessino was born in the Bronx in 1925. She received a bachelor's degree in biology from Hunter College in 1946, and shortly afterward was hired to work at the museum's information desk. The next year, she joined the education department.         When Ms. Pessino first came to the museum, its dusty, glassed-in exhibits were geared primarily to adult visitors. What was more, she realized, most city children considered the natural world irrelevant. In 1954, Ms. Pessino and several colleagues established the Peter Van Gerbig Natural Science Center at the museum. It was intended to be a place where children could not only study nature but also handle it, often for the first time.         There were other nature centers for children around the country, but perhaps none focused so intimately on urban life forms. In 1960, Ms. Pessino became the head of the center, renamed the Alexander M. White Natural Science Center. In 1973, she oversaw the creation of new exhibits that showcased the flora, fauna and geology of New York.         There were pussy willows, and a piece of city sidewalk with a tree growing through it. There was an ant farm, and an escaped tropical lizard that had been apprehended in Central Park. There were starlings and squirrels, frogs and fossils and dandelions.         Of course, there was a cockroach display. It was one of the easiest for Ms. Pessino to pull together.         In addition to running the natural science center, Ms. Pessino supervised the Louis Calder Natural Science Laboratory at the museum, where students could conduct research. She also advised the New York City Board of Education on the science curriculum.         During these years, Ms. Pessino was also closely involved with the Great Gull Island Committee. A joint project of the museum and the Linnaean Society of New York, the committee oversees research on the island's tern population. In the course of her work, Ms. Pessino spent many weeks living on the island, a desolate outcropping in Long Island Sound seven miles off Orient Point.         Until the mid-19th century, Great Gull Island was home to vast colonies of nesting terns. By the end of the century, hundreds of thousands had been slaughtered for the millinery trade. In 1897, the federal government began building Fort Michie on the island, which was soon overrun with buildings and ordnance. This devastated the remaining tern population.         Designed to protect the entrance to the sound, the fort remained active through the end of World War II. The museum acquired the island in 1949.         In 1950, Ms. Pessino and a colleague, Lois J. Hussey, were put ashore there, amid the ruins of the derelict fort. There was no telephone, fresh water, plumbing or electricity. The Coast Guardsmen who ferried them across spoke gleefully of shipwrecked sailors, and of ''mosquitoes so large that one holds you by the arms while another sucks blood,'' the women wrote in the April 1951 issue of Natural History magazine.         They stayed for a month, setting up camp in an abandoned observation tower alongside companionable spiders and mice. They found no terns nesting on the island, though a number visited each day to feed.         ''To see flocks of 20, 50 or 200 terns feeding is an unforgettable sight,'' the women wrote. ''The contrast of black caps and gleaming white feathers, flashes of brightly colored bills and feet, the seemingly effortless and marvelously graceful flight produce a never-to-be-forgotten picture. They fly over the water with heads bent, pause, hover for an instant, then plunge headfirst into the water.''         On subsequent visits, Ms. Pessino and her co-workers made a habitat for the terns by clearing undergrowth, tearing down Quonset huts and covering exposed concrete with sand and beach grass. Little by little, the birds returned to the island.         Today, about 1,600 pairs of roseate terns and about 9,500 pairs of common terns nest there, according to Helen Hays, the current chairwoman of the Great Gull Island Committee.         With Ms. Hussey, Ms. Pessino wrote three books for young people, all published by Thomas Y. Crowell: ''Collecting Cocoons'' (1953); ''Collecting Small Fossils'' (1970); and ''Collecting for the City Naturalist'' (1975).         Ms. Pessino, who retired from the museum in 1985, leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Ruth M. Siems, a retired home economist whose best-known innovation will make its appearance, welcome or otherwise, in millions of homes tomorrow, died on Nov. 13 at her home in Newburgh, Ind. Ms. Siems, an inventor of Stove Top stuffing, was 74.         The cause was a heart attack, according to the Warrick County coroner's office in Boonville, Ind.         Ms. Siems (pronounced ''Seems'') spent more than three decades on the staff of General Foods, which introduced the Stove Top brand in 1972. Today, Kraft Foods, which now owns the brand, sells about 60 million boxes of it at Thanksgiving, a company spokeswoman said.         Prepared in five minutes on the stove or in the microwave, Stove Top stuffing comes in a range of flavors, including turkey, chicken, beef, cornbread and sourdough.         Comforting or campy, Stove Top stuffing is an enduring emblem of postwar convenience culture. Its early advertising tag line, ''Stuffing instead of potatoes?'' remains in the collective consciousness.         As Laura Shapiro, the author of ''Something From the Oven: Reinventing Dinner in 1950's America'' (Viking, 2004), said in a telephone interview yesterday:         ''Stove Top made it possible to have the stuffing without the turkey, probably something no cook would ever have dreamed of but people eating Thanksgiving dinner might well have thought of: 'Take away everything else; just leave me here with the stuffing!' It's kind of like eating the chocolate chips without the cookies.''         Stove Top's premise is threefold. First, it offers speed.         Second, it divorces the stuffing from the bird, sparing cooks the nasty business of having to root around in the clammy interior of an animal.         Third, it frees stuffing from the yoke of Thanksgiving; it can be cooked and eaten on a moment's notice any day of the year.         In 1975, General Foods was awarded United States Patent No. 3,870,803 for the product, generically called Instant Stuffing Mix. Ms. Siems is listed first among the inventors, followed by Anthony C. Capossela Jr., John F. Halligan and C. Robert Wyss.         The secret lay in the crumb size. If the dried bread crumb is too small, adding water to it makes a soggy mass; too large, and the result is gravel. In other words, as the patent explains, ''The nature of the cell structure and overall texture of the dried bread crumb employed in this invention is of great importance if a stuffing which will hydrate in a matter of minutes to the proper texture and mouthfeel is to be prepared.''         A member of the research and development staff at General Foods, Ms. Siems was instrumental, her sister Suzanne Porter said, in arriving at the precise crumb dimensions -- about the size of a pencil eraser.         Ruth Miriam Siems was born in Evansville, Ind., on Feb. 20, 1931. She earned an undergraduate degree in home economics from Purdue University in 1953, and after graduation took a job at the General Foods plant in Evansville, where she worked on flours and cake mixes. She moved to the company's technical center in Tarrytown, N.Y., not long afterward. Ms. Siems retired in 1985.         Besides Ms. Porter, of Copley, Ohio, Ms. Siems is survived by another sister, Rosemary Snyder, of Chicago; and a brother, David, of Milford, Mich.         As a mark of just how deeply inscribed on the American palate Ms. Siems's stuffing has become, there are several recipes, available on the Internet, that promise to reproduce the taste of Stove Top from scratch, using fresh ingredients.       
         Rona Jaffe, the preternaturally youthful writer whose 1958 novel ''The Best of Everything'' told the melodramatic story of four nubile, cashmere-sweatered career girls torn between storybook romance and cutthroat corporate Manhattan, died yesterday at University College Hospital in London, where she was on vacation. She was 74.         She died of cancer, said Alan C. Rothfeld, her lawyer and longtime friend.         Essentially commissioned by the movie producer Jerry Wald, Ms. Jaffe was a 25-year-old former associate editor in publishing when she sat down to write a book that Mr. Wald could turn into a blockbuster feature like ''Kitty Foyle: The Natural History of a Woman,'' a 1940 film that won Ginger Rogers an Academy Award for playing a plucky working girl who finds love, heartache, an unwanted pregnancy and, finally, romantic redemption. Published by Simon & Schuster, ''The Best of Everything,'' which drew on Ms. Jaffe's four-year employment at Fawcett Publications, as well as the experiences of close friends, was the urban answer to ''Peyton Place,'' Grace Metalious's risqué novel of lust in small-town America, which had been published two years earlier.         Ms. Jaffe's beautiful heroines -- Caroline, April, Barbara and Gregg -- toil as stenographers but are distracted by men, most of them cads, not to mention a lecherous boss called Mr. Shalimar. As Martin Levin of The New York Times wrote in a review of the book: ''Before very many coffee breaks one is a stretcher case, one is pregnant and the third is off to Las Vegas with a notorious lounge lizard. But that's the life of a working girl, at least as seen through Miss Jaffe's wide eyes.''         Critics howled, but America was entranced, which is precisely what its editor, Robert Gottlieb, was sure would happen. ''It was a basic story -- three or four or five girls start off together, one finds love, one goes crazy and/or dies, and one of them becomes a huge success -- but Rona's take was very up-to-date,'' Mr. Gottlieb said last night in a telephone interview. ''What made it work for the time was that it had a fresh young-career-women-in-New York quality with a fillip of shock.''         The synergy of its canny packaging as a book written expressly for Hollywood production was equally shocking at the time. Within two weeks of publication, the book was on the New York Times best-seller list, where it stayed for five months.         Less than a year later, thanks to Jerry Wald's involvement, ''The Best of Everything'' was released as a chic but heavy-handed film by 20th Century Fox and the director Jean Negulesco. The heroines' work site, Fabian Publishing, was set in the brand-new Seagram Building, and some of the sets were designed in seeming homage to a hot New York society decorator of the moment, Michael Greer. In a review of the movie's release on DVD last summer, Amy Nicholson of the Web site digsmagazine.com described its melodramatic, nail-biting charms as best accompanied by ''bonbons, chilled blush wine and possibly an emergency hanky.''         Hope Lange, Diane Baker, Martha Hyer and the 1950's supermodel Suzy Parker starred as the young women about town. Joan Crawford made a special appearance as Amanda Farrow, an ill-tempered book editor who, the film makes pointedly clear, has sacrificed personal happiness for professional glory. But it was Ms. Jaffe who went in a relative nobody and came back a star.         Born in 1931 in Brooklyn, Ms. Jaffe grew up in posh circumstances on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, the only child of Samuel Jaffe, an elementary-school principal, and his first wife, Diana, a high-strung socialite who had an independent fortune and a suburban estate in Connecticut. Her maternal grandfather was Moses Ginsberg, a millionaire construction magnate who built the Carlyle hotel.         Unlike her rather passive fictional characters, however, the tough-talking Ms. Jaffe was professionally ambitious and openly spoke of her desire to be a success. After graduating from the Dalton School at 15 and Radcliffe College four years later, she became a file clerk at Fawcett, eventually becoming an associate editor before leaving to write ''The Best of Everything.''         Like many of her characters, she had numerous romantic adventures, including a relationship with an Astor real estate heir. Ms. Jaffe did not, however, ever marry, preferring to avoid what she once dismissively described as ''the rat race to the altar.'' She leaves no survivors.         In the decades that followed ''The Best of Everything,'' Ms. Jaffe wrote 15 more popular books, several of which used the quartet-of-women narrative approach, including ''The Last Chance,'' a 1976 novel that one reviewer described as ''best devoured alone in bed, with a container of yogurt,'' and ''Class Reunion,'' a sudsy 1979 novel about three decades in the lives of four Radcliffe classmates, one of whom has a gay husband. Her last book was ''The Room-Mating Season,'' published in 2003. Mr. Gottlieb said he believed that her finest work was ''Mr. Right Is Dead,'' a 1965 collection of short stories and the title novella, about a call girl.         In her later years, Ms. Jaffe established herself as a patron of the arts. In 1995, she established the Rona Jaffe Foundation, which provides grants to emerging female writers. ''All writers need support, but many women in early career have fewer resources available to them and often many demands made upon them,'' Ms. Jaffe said in September at an awards ceremony. ''It gives me great pleasure to help some of them make their way at this early stage.''       
         Selma Jeanne Cohen, a historian, editor and teacher who devoted her career to proclaiming dance an art worthy of the same scholarly respect traditionally awarded to painting, music and literature, died on Friday at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 85.         The cause was complications from Alzheimer's disease, said Leslie Steinau, her lawyer and a longtime friend.         Ms. Cohen waged a tireless campaign against scholars who maintained that dance was inherently frivolous. Instead, she believed it had a rich history that could be fruitfully analyzed from many philosophical viewpoints. Her efforts led her to become America's leading figure in dance scholarship.         Her most ambitious achievement was her editing of The International Encyclopedia of Dance for Oxford University Press. Published in 1998 after two decades of planning, and encompassing all forms of dance, the six-volume work, modeled on The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, remains the most comprehensive guide of its kind.         Eclectic scholarly interests had prompted Ms. Cohen, A. J.Pischl and Sheppard Black in 1959 to found Dance Perspectives, a journal dedicated to monographs on various aspects of world dance. Ms. Cohen became its sole editor in 1966. After it ceased publication in 1976, the Dance Perspectives Foundation, which she had established, continued to award an annual prize for the best dance book of the year.         Ms. Cohen was born in Chicago, attended elementary and high school at the University of Chicago Laboratory School and went on to the university itself, receiving a Ph.D. in English in 1946.         When a childhood friend started taking ballet lessons from Edna McRae, a respected Chicago teacher, Ms. Cohen went along. Ms. Cohen soon realized she had no dancing talent. But she had great curiosity, and McRae had a dance library, which Ms. Cohen devoured.         She began teaching English at the University of California at Los Angeles in 1946 and, at the same time, worked with the Los Angeles teacher and choreographer Eugene Loring. After moving to New York in 1953, she devoted herself to dance and started reviewing for Dance Observer. From 1955 to 1958 she was a dance critic at The New York Times, where she assisted John Martin, who was chief dance critic. She was dance critic for The Saturday Review in 1965 and 1966.         Ms. Cohen was a member of the first National Endowment for the Arts Dance Panel in 1966; organized a critics' conference at the American Dance Festival in New London, Conn., in 1970; and taught over the years at many colleges, including the University of Chicago, where she returned to head summer seminars from 1974 to 1976. Ms. Cohen wrote and edited several important books, among them ''The Modern Dance: Seven Statements of Belief'' (Wesleyan University Press, 1966), an anthology of essays by contemporary choreographers; ''Doris Humphrey: An Artist First'' (Wesleyan, 1972), a biography of a pioneering modern dancer; and ''Next Week, Swan Lake'' (Wesleyan, 1982), a study of dance aesthetics. Her ''Dance as a Theater Art'' (Dodd, Mead, 1974), a history of dance since the Renaissance, remains a popular college text.         Ms. Cohen, a tiny soft-spoken woman, could be a rigorous teacher, but she delighted in presiding graciously over social events. Friends, colleagues and students often met informally at her apartment, gatherings usually graced by Giselle, her long-lived and much-pampered cat. Ms. Cohen often jokingly said she hoped to write a treatise on feline aesthetics someday.         No immediate family members survive.
