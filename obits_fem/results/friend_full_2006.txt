         Wendy Wasserstein, who spoke for a generation of smart, driven but sometimes unsatisfied women in a series of popular plays that included the long-running Pulitzer Prize winner ''The Heidi Chronicles,'' died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 55 and lived in New York.         The cause was complications of lymphoma, said André Bishop, the artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater.         Starting in 1977 with her breakthrough work, ''Uncommon Women and Others,'' Ms. Wasserstein's plays struck a profound chord with women struggling to reconcile a desire for romance and companionship, drummed into baby boomers by the seductive fantasies of Hollywood movies, with the need for intellectual independence and achievement separate from the personal sphere.         ''She was known for being a popular, funny playwright, but she was also a woman and a writer of deep conviction and political activism,'' Mr. Bishop said. ''In Wendy's plays women saw themselves portrayed in a way they hadn't been onstage before -- wittily, intelligently and seriously at the same time. We take that for granted now, but it was not the case 25 years ago. She was a real pioneer.''         The lights on Broadway are to be dimmed tonight in her honor.         Her heroines -- intelligent and successful but also riddled with self-doubt -- sought enduring love a little ambivalently, but they didn't always find it, and their hard-earned sense of self-worth was often shadowed by the frustrating knowledge that American women's lives continued to be measured by their success at capturing the right man. Ms. Wasserstein drew on her own experience as a smart, well-educated, funny Manhattanite who wasn't particularly lucky in romance to create heroines in a similar mold, women who embraced the essential tenets of the feminist movement but didn't have the stomach for stridency.         For Ms. Wasserstein, as for many of her characters and fans, humor was a necessary bulwark against the disappointments of life, and a useful release valve for anger at cultural and social inequities. Her work, which included three books of nonfiction and a forthcoming novel as well as about a dozen plays, had a significant influence on depictions of American women in the media landscape over the years: Heidi Holland, the steadily single, uncompromising heroine of ''The Heidi Chronicles,'' can be seen as the cultural progenitor of ''Sex and the City's'' Carrie Bradshaw. (Coincidentally, Sarah Jessica Parker, who starred in that HBO series, played a series of small roles in the original production of ''The Heidi Chronicles.'')         Ms. Wasserstein, who grew up in New York, recalled attending Broadway plays as a young woman and being struck by the absence of people like herself onstage: ''I remember going to them and thinking, I really like this, but where are the girls?'' she once said. Ms. Wasserstein would fill the stage with ''girls'' -- a term she used with a wink despite taking flak for it -- in a series of plays that pleased loyal audiences even when the critics did not always embrace them.         ''The Heidi Chronicles,'' her most celebrated and popular play, opened on Broadway in 1989 after receiving critical acclaim Off Broadway. It ran for 622 performances and collected the Tony and New York Drama Critics Circle awards for best play as well as the Pulitzer Prize. Joan Allen created the title role in the play, which toured nationally and was later filmed for television with Jamie Lee Curtis.         Reviewing the play in Newsday, Linda Winer called it ''a wonderful and important play.'' She continued, ''Smart, compassionate, witty, courageous, this one not only dares to ask the hard questions  but asks them with humor, exquisite clarity and great fullness of heart.''         Ranging across more than two decades, ''The Heidi Chronicles'' was an episodic, seriocomic biography of an art historian seeking to establish a fixed and fulfilling sense of identity amid the social convolutions of the 1960's and 70's, a period when the rulebook on relationships between men and women was being rewritten. Heidi's allegiance to her ideals and her unwillingness to compromise them for the sake of winning a man's attentions caused conflict with friends who chose easier or different paths. Looking around at her materialistic, married, self-obsessed peers two decades after the exhilarating birth of feminism, Heidi observes: ''We're all concerned, intelligent, good women. It's just that I feel stranded. And I thought the whole point was that we wouldn't feel stranded. I thought the point was that we were all in this together.''         In the play's bittersweet final scene, Heidi has become a single mother to a new infant -- a path Ms. Wasserstein would herself pursue many years later, ultimately at great physical cost, when she gave birth, at age 48, to her daughter, Lucy Jane, in 1999.         Her next play, ''The Sisters Rosensweig,'' brought the issues of ethnicity and religion into her continuing conversation about the making and remaking of women's identities as it focused on three sisters with different relationships to their Jewish roots. It opened on Broadway in 1993, ran for 556 performances and was nominated for a Tony Award for best play. Less successful was her 1997 play, ''An American Daughter,'' inspired by the harsh attacks on women in politics, which lasted only 89 performances on Broadway, though Ms. Wasserstein later adapted it for television.         Ms. Wasserstein's other plays were produced Off Broadway, and included ''Isn't It Romantic'' (originally produced, to mixed notices, in 1981 and revised in 1983, when it was largely acclaimed) and ''Old Money'' (2000), a time-traveling comedy about the well heeled. Her most recent play, ''Third,'' about a female professor who is forced to question her staunchly held ideas about politics and ethics, opened in the fall at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater at Lincoln Center.         Ms. Wasserstein's abundant gift for comedy and her plays' popularity disguised the more serious ambitions underpinning her writing. ''My work is often thought of as lightweight commercial comedy,'' she told The Paris Review in 1997, ''and I have always thought, No, you don't understand: this is in fact a political act. 'The Sisters Rosensweig' had the largest advance in Broadway history,'' for a play (not a musical). Therefore, she continued, ''nobody is going to turn down a play on Broadway because a woman wrote it or because it's about women.'' When Ms. Wasserstein won the best-play Tony for ''Heidi Chronicles,'' it was the first time a woman had won the prize solo.         Ms. Wasserstein was born in Brooklyn on Oct. 18, 1950, the youngest of five siblings. Her father was a textile manufacturer, her mother an amateur dancer. In addition to her daughter, Ms. Wasserstein is survived by her mother, Lola Wasserstein; her brothers, Abner and Bruce, the chairman of the investment banking giant Lazard and the owner of New York magazine; and her sister Georgette Levis of Vermont. The family moved to Manhattan when Ms. Wasserstein was 12. After earning her undergraduate degree from Mount Holyoke College in 1971, she studied creative writing at City College with Joseph Heller and Israel Horovitz. Her first play, ''Any Woman Can't,'' found its way to Playwrights Horizons, then a small Off Broadway company, and was produced in 1973, shortly before she began to study playwriting in earnest at the Yale University School of Drama. (''My parents only let me go to drama school because it was Yale,'' she said in an interview for the magazine Bomb. ''They thought I'd marry a lawyer.'')         Ms. Wasserstein's career would be closely linked both with Playwrights Horizons, which under its artistic director, Mr. Bishop, would first produce ''The Heidi Chronicles,'' and with many of the artists she met at Yale, including the designer Heidi Ettinger and the director James Lapine, who remained lifelong friends. (Mr. Bishop left Playwrights Horizons to move to Lincoln Center Theater, which has produced all her subsequent plays.) Ms. Wasserstein's classmate, the playwright Christopher Durang, was a particular friend; she used his introductory icebreaker -- ''You look so bored, you must be very bright'' -- directly in ''The Heidi Chronicles,'' and they collaborated on a revue for the school's cabaret group.         After receiving a master's degree in fine arts in 1976, Ms. Wasserstein returned to Manhattan, and essentially never left. Her first major success came quickly, with ''Uncommon Women'' in 1977, produced by the Phoenix Theater. Depicting an informal reunion of a group of Mount Holyoke graduates that dissolves into scenes of their college days, it was described as ''funny, ironic and affectionate'' by Edith Oliver in The New Yorker, who added, ''Under the laughter there is  a feeling of bewilderment and disappointment over the world outside college, which promised so much, and with their own dreams, which seem to have stalled.'' The play, which was filmed and telecast on PBS's ''Great Performances,'' was also an important breakthrough in the careers of the actresses Glenn Close, Swoosie Kurtz and Meryl Streep, who played Ms. Close's role in the television version.         Ms. Wasserstein's other writing included a spoof of self-help literature, ''Sloth'' (Oxford University Press, 2005), and two books of essays, ''Bachelor Girls'' (Knopf, 1990) and ''Shiksa Goddess'' (Knopf, 2001), eclectic collections that embraced such disparate topics as Chekhov, her sister's battle with breast cancer, and the life and career of Mrs. Entenmann, creator of a bakery empire and fosterer of much guilt. Included in ''Shiksa Goddess'' was an essay Ms. Wasserstein wrote for The New Yorker, as poignant as it was hilarious, in which she discussed the medical complications of her late-life pregnancy and her newborn daughter's early struggles. ''Although I remain a religious skeptic,'' she wrote, referring to the disorienting days following Lucy Jane's premature birth, ''I had a kind of blind faith. I believed in the collaboration between the firm will of my one-pound-twelve-ounce daughter and the expertise of modern medicine. Of course, there was more than a bit of random luck involved, too.''         Lucy Jane will live with Ms. Wasserstein's brother Bruce.         Ms. Wasserstein also wrote a children's book, ''Pamela's First Musical,'' which she adapted for the stage in collaboration with Cy Coleman and David Zippel, and wrote the libretto for ''The Festival of Regrets,'' one of three one-act operas presented under the collective title ''Central Park'' at the New York City Opera. She had also completed a libretto for another opera with music by Deborah Drattell.         Ms. Wasserstein worked intermittently for Hollywood, although her sole produced screenplay credit was for ''The Object of My Affection,'' a 1998 romantic comedy that starred Jennifer Aniston. Her first novel, ''Elements of Style,'' is to be published by Knopf in April.         But the object of Ms. Wasserstein's deepest affection was always the stage, and her relationship with the theater permeated all aspects of her life. Her friendships in the theatrical community (and out of it) were wide and deep, and she generously gave of her time and resources to benefits of all kinds. A recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship, she later served on the Guggenheim Foundation board, and she also taught playwriting at several universities.         In 1998, seeking to help instill her love for theater in a new generation of New Yorkers, she personally instigated a program to bring smart, underprivileged students from New York's public high schools to the theater. In an essay about the program for The New York Times, she wrote: ''As far as I'm concerned, every New Yorker is born with the inalienable right to ride the D train, shout 'Hey, lady!' with indignation and grow up going regularly to the theater. After all, if a city is fortunate enough to house an entire theater district, shouldn't access to the stage life within it be what makes coming of age in New York different from any other American city?''         The program, administered by the Theater Development Fund, has steadily expanded since Ms. Wasserstein first held a pizza party for eight students from DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx after a matinee of ''On the Town.'' Now officially called Open Doors, it consists of 17 groups (more than 100 students), chaperoned to a season's worth of theater offerings by interested mentors.         Of course Ms. Wasserstein's devotion to theater took its purest and most enduring form in her writing for the stage, which allowed her the freedom to explore the evolving lives of American women with a fluidity and frankness that befitted the complex experience she was writing about. Although it was always laced with comedy, her work was also imbued with an abiding sadness, a cleareyed understanding that independence can beget loneliness, that rigorous ideals and raised consciousnesses are not always good company at the dinner table. But she shared her compassion among a wide array of characters, those who settled and those who continued to search.         ''No matter how lonely you get or how many birth announcements you receive,'' a character says in ''Isn't It Romantic,'' ''the trick is not to get frightened. There's nothing wrong with being alone.'' The popularity of her work speaks for her ability to salve a little of that feeling of aloneness in her audiences with her deeply felt portraits of women -- and occasionally men -- seeking solidarity in their individuality, finding comfort in the knowledge that everybody else is sometimes uncomfortable with the choices they've made, too.       
         Anne Meacham, an actress whose notable stage appearances included roles in the original production of Tennessee Williams's ''Suddenly Last Summer'' and Eva Le Gallienne's 1964 Broadway staging of ''The Seagull,'' died on Thursday at her home in Canaan, N.Y. She was 80.         Her death was announced by her friend Marian Seldes.         Although her career spanned several decades and included a stint on the soap opera ''Another World,'' Ms. Meacham is probably best known for her work in the plays of Tennessee Williams, who once praised her in an article for The New York Times, saying, ''There's nothing she won't say or do onstage without any sign of embarrassment.''         Ms. Meacham won an Obie Award for her performance as the fragile, emotionally distraught Catharine Holly in ''Suddenly, Last Summer,'' the more successful and more often revived half of the 1958 Off Broadway double bill ''Garden District.'' (Elizabeth Taylor took the role in the movie version.)         Ms. Meacham appeared in Williams's ''In the Bar of a Tokyo Hotel,'' from 1969, and in a production of his 1966 play ''The Gnadiges Fraulein.'' She also had a long friendship with the playwright.         Born July 21, 1925, in Chicago, Ms. Meacham studied at the Yale School of Drama and at the Neighborhood Playhouse in the 1940's. Her New York stage debut came in the short-lived 1952 World War II comedy ''The Long Watch,'' for which she won a Clarence Derwent Award, a prize for newcomers to New York.         Other Broadway appearances included Jean Giraudoux's ''Ondine,'' which starred Mel Ferrer and Audrey Hepburn and was directed by Alfred Lunt; an adaptation of Henry James's ''The Europeans,'' titled ''Eugenia,'' starring Tallulah Bankhead; and repertory appearances in the New York stands of ''The Crucible'' (as Elizabeth Proctor) and ''The Seagull'' (as Nina) in 1964.         Ms. Meacham's last Broadway appearance was as Gertrude in Tom Stoppard's ''Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead'' in 1968. She won a second Obie award for a revival of ''Hedda Gabler'' in 1961.         Ms. Meacham made her film debut in ''Lilith'' in 1964 and made many television appearances in the 50's and 60's before joining the cast of ''Another World'' in 1972 as Louise Goddard, an oddball maid.         She is survived by a sister, Jane Brower, of Winnetka, Ill.       
         Coretta Scott King, known first as the wife of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., then as his widow, then as an avid proselytizer for his vision of racial peace and nonviolent social change, died Monday at a hospital in Mexico. She was 78.         The primary cause of death was ''insufficient cardio-respiratory,'' which simply means her heart and breathing stopped, said Dr. Carlos Guerrero Tejada, who certified her death. The underlying causes were cerebral vascular disease and ovarian cancer, according to the death certificate.         Mrs. King died at Hospital Santa Mónica in Rosarito, Mexico, about 16 miles south of San Diego. She was admitted to the hospital last Thursday, said her sister, Edythe Scott Bagley. Mrs. Bagley said Mrs. King's body would be returned to her home, Atlanta, for entombment next to her husband, whose crypt is at the Martin Luther King Jr. Center there.         Mrs. King had been in failing health after a stroke and a heart attack last August. She appeared at a dinner honoring her husband on Jan. 14 but did not speak.         Andrew Young, a former United Nations ambassador and longtime family friend, said at a news conference yesterday morning that Mrs. King died in her sleep.         ''She was a woman born to struggle,'' Mr. Young said, ''and she has struggled and she has overcome.'' Mrs. King rose from rural poverty in Heiberger, Ala., and became an international symbol of the civil rights movement of the 1960's. She was an advocate for women's rights, the struggle against apartheid in South Africa, and other social and political issues.         In 1952, she was studying music at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston when she met a young graduate student in philosophy, who, on their first date, told her: ''The four things that I look for in a wife are character, personality, intelligence and beauty. And you have them all.'' A year later she and Dr. King, then a young minister from a prominent Atlanta family, were married, beginning a remarkable partnership that ended with Dr. King's assassination in Memphis on April 4, 1968.         Mrs. King did not hesitate to pick up his mantle, marching before her husband was even buried at the head of the striking garbage workers he had gone to Memphis to champion. She went on to lead the effort for a national holiday in his honor and to found the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Non-Violent Social Change in Atlanta, dedicated both to scholarship and to activism.         In addition to dealing with her husband's death, which left her with four young children, Mrs. King faced other trials and controversies. She was at times viewed as chilly and aloof by others in the civil rights movement. The King Center was criticized as competing for funds and siphoning energy from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which Dr. King had helped found. In recent years, the center had been widely viewed as adrift, characterized by squabbling within the family and a focus more on Dr. King's legacy than on continuing his work. Many allies were baffled and hurt by her campaign to exonerate James Earl Ray, who in 1969 pleaded guilty to her husband's murder, and her contention that Ray did not commit the crime.         More often, however, Mrs. King has been seen as an inspirational figure, a woman of enormous spiritual depth who came to personify the ideals Dr. King fought for.         ''She'll be remembered as a strong woman whose grace and dignity held up the image of her husband as a man of peace, of racial justice, of fairness,'' said the Rev. Joseph Lowery, who helped found the Southern Christian Leadership Conference with Dr. King and then served as its president for 20 years. ''I don't know that she was a civil rights leader in the truest sense, but she became a civil rights figure and a civil rights icon because of what she came to represent.''         Coretta Scott was born April 27, 1927, the second of three children born to Obadiah and Bernice Scott. She grew up in a two-room house that her father had built on land that had been owned by the family for three generations.         The family was poor, and she grew up picking cotton in the hot fields of the segregated South or doing housework. But Mr. Scott hauled timber, owned a country store and worked as a barber. His wife drove a school bus, and the whole family helped raise hogs, cows, chickens and vegetables. So, by the standards of blacks in Alabama at the time, the family had both resources and ambitions beyond the reach of most others.         Some of Coretta Scott's earliest insights into the injustice of segregation came as she walked to her one-room schoolhouse each day, watching buses of white children stir up dust as they passed. She got her first sense of the world beyond rural Alabama when she attended the Lincoln School, a private missionary institution in nearby Marion, where she studied piano and voice and had her first encounters with college-educated teachers, and where she resolved to flee to a world far beyond rural, segregated Alabama.         She graduated first in her high school class of 17 in 1945 and attended Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, where, two years earlier, her older sister, Edythe, had been the first black to enroll. She studied education and music, and went on to the New England Conservatory of Music, hoping to become a classical singer. She worked as a mail order clerk and cleaned houses to augment a fellowship that barely paid her tuition.         A First Encounter         Her first encounter with the man who would become her husband did not begin auspiciously, as recounted in ''Parting the Waters,'' by Taylor Branch. Dr. King, in the market for a wife, called her after getting her name from a friend and announced: ''You know every Napoleon has his Waterloo. I'm like Napoleon. I'm at my Waterloo, and I'm on my knees.''         Ms. Scott, two years his elder, replied: ''That's absurd. You don't even know me.''         Still, she agreed to meet for lunch the next day, only to be put off initially that he was not taller. But she was impressed by his erudition and confidence, and he saw in her the refined, intelligent woman he was looking for to be the wife of a preacher from one of Atlanta's most prominent ministerial families.         When he proposed, she deliberated for six months before saying yes, and they were married in the garden of her parents' house on June 18, 1953. The 350 guests, big-city folks from Atlanta and rural neighbors from Alabama, made it the biggest wedding, white or black, the area had ever seen.         Even before the wedding she made it clear she intended to remain her own woman. She stunned Dr. King's father, who presided over the wedding, by demanding that the promise to obey her husband be removed from the wedding vows. Reluctantly, he went along. After the wedding, the bridegroom fell asleep in the car while the new Mrs. King drove back to Atlanta.         Mrs. King thought she was signing on for the ministry, not ground zero in the seismic cultural struggle that would soon shake the South. Her husband became minister of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery in 1954, but about a year later, the Montgomery Bus Boycott brought Dr. King to national attention. Then, like riders on a runaway freight train, the minister and his young wife found themselves in the middle of a movement that would transform the South and ripple through the nation.         In 1960, the family moved back to Atlanta, where Dr. King shared the pulpit of the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church with his father.         With four young children to raise -- Yolanda, born in 1955; Martin III, in 1957; Dexter, in 1961; and Bernice, in 1963 -- and a movement dominated by men, Mrs. King mostly remained away from the front lines of the movement. But the danger was always there, including a brush with death when Dr. King was stabbed while autographing books in Harlem in 1958.         An Active Role         What role Mrs. King would play was a source of some tension. Wanting to be there for their children, she also wanted to be active in the movement. Dr. King was, she had said, traditional in his view of women and balked at the notion that she should be more conspicuous.         ''Martin was a very strong person, and in many ways had very traditional ideas about women,'' she told The New York Times Magazine in 1972.         She added: ''He'd say, 'I have no choice, I have to do this, but you haven't been called.' And I said, 'Can't you understand? You know I have an urge to serve just like you have.' ''         Still, he always described her as a partner in his mission, not just a supportive spouse. ''I wish I could say, to satisfy my masculine ego, that I led her down this path,'' he said in a 1967 interview. ''But I must say we went down together, because she was as actively involved and concerned when we met as she is now.''         She largely carved out her own niche, most prominently through more than 30 Freedom Concerts, at which she lectured, read poetry and sang to raise awareness of and money for the civil rights movement.         The division disappeared with Dr. King's assassination. Suddenly, she was not just a symbol of the nation's grief, but a woman devoted to carrying on her husband's work. How to do that was something that evolved over time.         Marching in Memphis was a dramatic statement, but Ralph Abernathy, one of Dr. King's lieutenants, was chosen to take over.         In stepping in for her husband after his death, Mrs. King at first used his own words as much as possible, as if her goal were simply to maintain his presence. But soon she developed her own language and her own causes. So, when she stood in for her husband at the Poor People's Campaign at the Lincoln Memorial on June 19, 1968, she spoke not just of his vision, but of hers, of gender as well as race. She called upon American women ''to unite and form a solid block of women power to fight the three great evils of racism, poverty and war.''         She joined the board of directors of the National Organization for Women and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and she became widely identified with a broad array of international human rights issues, rather than focusing primarily on race.         That broad view, she would argue, was completely in keeping with Dr. King's vision. To carry on that legacy, she focused on two tasks. The first was to have a national holiday established in Dr. King's honor, and the second was to build the center in Atlanta to honor his memory, continue his work and provide a research facility for scholars of his work and the civil rights era.         The first goal was achieved, despite much opposition, in 1983, when Congress approved a measure designating the third Monday in January as a federal holiday in honor of Dr. King, who was born in Atlanta on Jan. 15, 1929. President Ronald Reagan, who had long opposed the King Holiday as too expensive and inappropriate, signed the bill, but pointedly refrained from criticizing fellow Republicans like Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, who had opposed Dr. King, saying he had consorted with Communists.         The holiday was first observed on Jan. 20, 1986.         The second goal, much more expensive, time consuming and elusive, remains a work in progress -- and a troubled one at that. When Mrs. King announced plans for a memorial in 1969, she envisioned a Lincolnesque tomb, an exhibition hall, the restoration of her husband's childhood home, institutes on nonviolent social change and Afro-American studies, a library building, an archives building and a museum of African-American life and culture. She envisioned a center that would be a haven for scholars and a training ground for advocates of nonviolent social change.         An Ambitious Struggle         Even friends say it may have been too ambitious a goal. Building the center was a major achievement, but many of Dr. King's allies, particularly the leaders of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, said it was draining scarce resources.         The center also struggled to find its mission. Critics worried that it had become a family enterprise, Dexter and Martin III vying for leadership. The problems became particularly acute after Mrs. King suffered a stroke and heart attack in August 2005. The brothers struggled for control over the center while she was recuperating.         Many supporters were saddened and baffled by the family's campaign on behalf of Mr. Ray, who confessed to killing Dr. King and then recanted. Mr. Ray was seeking a new trial when he died in 1998.         After Mr. Ray's death, Mrs. King issued a statement calling his death a tragedy for his family and for the nation and saying that a trial would have ''produced new revelations about the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. as well as establish the facts concerning Mr. Ray's innocence.''         Besides her four children and her sister, Edythe, of Cheyney, Pa., survivors include her brother, Obie Leonard Scott of Greensboro, Ala.         Mrs. King remained a beloved figure, often compared to Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis as a woman who overcame tragedy, held her family together and became an inspirational presence around the world.         Admirers said she bore her special burden -- being expected to carry on her husband's work and teachings -- with a sense of spirit and purpose that made her more than a symbol.         If picking up Dr. King's mantle was an impossible task, the relationship she shared with him was truly a partnership. ''I think on many points she educated me,'' Dr. King once said, and she never veered from the conviction, expressed throughout her life, that his dream was also hers.         ''I didn't learn my commitment from Martin,'' she told an interviewer. ''We just converged at a certain time.''         Correction:  February 17, 2006, Friday  An obituary of Coretta Scott King on Feb. 1 misstated the precedent set by her older sister, Edythe, at Antioch College, from which Mrs. King graduated. Her sister was the first to receive a scholarship under a program set up in 1945 to recruit minority students, not the first black to enroll.       
         Edna Lewis, the granddaughter of a former slave whose cookbooks revived the nearly forgotten genre of refined Southern cooking while offering a glimpse into African-American farm life in the early 20th century, died yesterday. She was 89.         Miss Lewis, as she was always called, died in her sleep in her home in Decatur, Ga., said Scott Peacock, her friend and caretaker. Mr. Peacock, a chef, had lived with Miss Lewis for more than six years, taking care of her as she grew frail.         Despite a quiet demeanor, Miss Lewis had a reach that extended from her family farm in Virginia, to left-wing politics in Manhattan to the birthplace of California cuisine.         Edna Lewis was born in a small settlement called Freetown in 1916, one of eight children. The farm had been granted to her grandfather, a freed slave. Growing, gathering and preparing food was more than just sustenance for the family; it was a form of entertainment. Without fancy cooking equipment, the family improvised, measuring baking powder on coins and cooking everything over wood.         In 1976, Miss Lewis turned the focused, close-to-nature cooking of her childhood into the first of her four books, ''The Taste of Country Cooking'' (Knopf). The book, considered a classic study of Southern cooking and one that sits on the shelves of America's best chefs, helped put an end to the knee-slapping, cornpone image of Southern food among many American cooks.         John T. Edge, the author and director of the Southern Foodways Alliance, said that because of her devotion to educating a nation about the nuances of Southern cooking, there was no question that the group's first lifetime achievement award, in 1999, would go to Miss Lewis.         He pointed to her recipe for shrimp and grits, a Southern classic. ''It's just butter and shrimp, but it requires great butter and great shrimp, and a puddle of that over stone-ground grits,'' he said. ''This pays homage to the frugal South, but it's also worthy of damask dinner cloth.''         Throughout her life, the politics of race and the swirl of New York drew Miss Lewis with a pull as strong as her Southern roots. She took a bus to New York when she was in her early 30's, eager for work but restricted by the racial attitudes of the times. An acquaintance found her a job in a laundry in Brooklyn, where she was assigned to an ironing board. She had never ironed and lasted three hours before a manager showed her to the door.         She sewed better than she ironed and was soon copying Dior dresses for Dorcas Avedon, then the wife of Richard Avedon. She made a dress for Marilyn Monroe, Mr. Peacock said, as well as the African-inspired dresses that became her signature.         In New York, she married Steve Kingston, a retired merchant seaman and a Communist. Shortly afterward, she became acquainted with John Nicholson, an antiques dealer who in 1949 decided to open a restaurant on the East Side of Manhattan. She became the cook, preparing cheese soufflés and roast chicken. Café Nicholson became an instant success among fashionistas, bohemians and artists.         She remained at the restaurant until the late 1950's, during which she and her husband would argue over its bourgeois character.         ''He used to always say, 'This restaurant should be for ordinary people on the street. You're catering to capitalists,' '' Mr. Nicholson said in an interview with The New York Times in 2004. ''It was such a bore.'' Miss Lewis left Café Nicolson in 1954, and the couple tried a number of ventures, including running a pheasant farm.         In the mid-1970's, while sidelined by a broken leg, Miss Lewis began writing a cookbook. With encouragement from Judith Jones, the cookbook editor at Knopf who also edited Julia Childs, Miss Lewis turned her handwritten pages into ''The Taste of Country Cooking.'' In 1979, Craig Claiborne of The Times said the book ''may well be the most entertaining regional cookbook in America.''         In a 1989 interview with The Times, Miss Lewis said: ''As a child in Virginia, I thought all food tasted delicious. After growing up, I didn't think food tasted the same, so it has been my lifelong effort to try and recapture those good flavors of the past.''         That dedication to purity of ingredients, taste and authenticity endeared her to Alice Waters and many other chefs. Ms. Waters, whose restaurant, Chez Panisse, in Berkeley defined California cuisine in the 1980's, said Miss Lewis was uncompromising but subtle in her approach to food and politics alike.         ''She just had a very quiet way of speaking, and it really engaged you because she was so soft-spoken; you have to listen carefully,'' Ms. Waters said. ''There was a kind of intimacy that you immediately had.''         Ms. Jones, who edited three books by Miss Lewis, recalled her yesterday as a lover of Jack Daniel's, Bessie Smith and understated conversation. ''She had a tremendous sense of dignity in the face of often difficult treatment,'' Ms. Jones said.         After ''The Taste of Country Cooking'' raised her profile, Miss Lewis returned to restaurants, most notably to Gage & Tollner in Brooklyn. She remained there for almost 20 years, retiring in 1995. Her husband had died as she completed her first book, Ms. Jones said.         Along with friends, she founded the Society for the Revival and Preservation of Southern Food, dedicated in part to seeing that people did not forget how to cook with lard.         One member of the group was Mr. Peacock, whom Miss Lewis met in 1990 while he was cooking at the Georgia governor's mansion. The two developed a deep friendship, collaborating on the book ''The Gift of Southern Cooking'' (Knopf) and teaching cooking classes. Their long association -- between a young, white, gay Southern chef and a widowed African-American doyenne -- earned them the nickname The Odd Couple of Southern Cooking.         As Miss Lewis aged, Mr. Peacock became her caretaker, causing a split with her surviving brothers and sisters, who waged an unsuccessful legal battle to move her to the family home in Unionville, Va., a town about 70 miles southwest of Washington.         Miss Lewis's dispute with her siblings became well known in the food world, most of whose members supported her and Mr. Peacock, seeing him as an eager student to a master of Southern cooking.         ''One of the biggest goals they had was that they didn't want to lose the classic Southern dishes, and this was the binding factor,'' Marion Cunningham, the grande dame of home cooking, said in an interview with The Times in 2004. ''They preached about it, and they wanted to let the country know what the South stood for.''         One sister, Ruth Lewis Smith, and a brother, George Lewis, both of Unionville, survive Miss Lewis, as does a stepsister, Bessie Jones of Philadelphia. She is also survived by Dr. Afeworki Paulos, a lecturer at the University of Michigan, whom she adopted as a young adult in 1986 shortly after he had arrived from Eritrea to study in the United States.         Dr. Paulos said his mother possessed a clear-headed sense of equality and fairness. ''I always say, yeah, the cooking is there,'' he said yesterday, ''but the way I remember her is as a woman who was very deeply involved in social issues.''         Mr. Peacock plans to hold a private memorial service for Miss Lewis in the Atlanta area. She will be buried in a family plot in Unionville.         Correction:  February 16, 2006, Thursday  An obituary on Tuesday about Edna Lewis, the chef and author who wrote about refined Southern cuisine, misstated the order of her cookbooks. Her most famous one, ''The Taste of Country Cooking'' (Knopf, 1976), was her second, not her first. ''The Edna Lewis Cookbook'' (Bobbs-Merrill, 1972) was her first.         Because of an editing error, the obituary misstated Miss Lewis's tenure as chef at Gage & Tollner in Brooklyn. It was 5 years, not 20. In some copies, also because of an editing error, the obituary misstated the surname of the cookbook author who, like Miss Lewis, had been edited by Judith Jones at Knopf. She was Julia Child, not Childs.       
         Peggy Appiah, who as a daughter of a British chancellor of the exchequer defied the conventions of her time by marrying an Ashanti political leader and who went on to become an author and a revered figure in her adopted homeland, Ghana, died Saturday in Kumasi, Ghana. She was 84.         The cause was a heart attack at Akomfo Anokye Hospital, according to her son, the philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah.         Reared in upper-crust Britain, the youngest of four children of Sir Stafford Cripps, a Labor party leader and cabinet officer in the Clement Attlee government (1945-51), Peggy Cripps caused an international sensation when she announced plans to marry in July 1953. Her fiancé was Joseph Emmanuel Appiah, who was in London as a law student and representative of Kwame Nkrumah, prime minister of the Gold Coast, the British colony that became Ghana in 1957.         Nkrumah was Ghana's first president, and Mr. Appiah was a close associate and his choice for vice president, until political differences led Nkrumah to imprison him several times.         The Appiahs are said to have been the inspiration, along with another African-British couple, Seretse Khama and Ruth Williams, for the 1967 film ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,'' which dealt with a California couple's reaction to their daughter's engagement to a black doctor.         That view was lent support by Henry Louis Gates Jr., chairman of the department of African and African-American studies at Harvard, and a friend of Mr. Appiah's since their student days, who noted that it was a marriage of equals at the highest levels of their societies.         ''She was to the manner born and he was an aristocrat related to the king of the Ashanti,'' Mr. Gates said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. ''He was the John Adams of his country; its founding father with Kwame Nkrumah.''         The couple met at a gathering of the West African Students Union, of which Mr. Appiah was president. From the start, Miss Cripps made it clear that she would not be intimidated by the firestorm of criticism the couple endured.         ''If we experience any difficulties in mixing with Europeans, I shall throw in my lot with the colored people,'' she told The Sunday Express of London.         The marriage came to symbolize far more than the union of two individuals. Richard Weight, a British historian who is making a documentary about interracial marriage, said: ''For a lot of people, it drew the line between those who thought Britain had an integrated postcolonial future and those who didn't. And it became an international story with particular resonance because it involved the daughter of a former chancellor.''         Born in 1921, Enid Margaret Cripps, who used the name Peggy, was the youngest of four children of Sir Stafford and Lady Isobel Swithenbank Cripps. On her father's side she could trace her lineage back to William the Conqueror. She was reared at a rambling country house, Goodfellows, and spent much of World War II in Moscow, where her father served as ambassador. After the war, she went to Iran, where she worked for the British Army, which ran the railways.         She is survived by her son, the Laurance Rockefeller professor of philosophy at Princeton, who lives in Manhattan and Princeton, N.J., and three daughters, Isabel Endresen, an economist, of Windhoek, Namibia, Adwo Edun, a landscape gardener, of Lagos, Nigeria, and Abena Appiah of Kumasi; and eight grandchildren. Settling in Kumasi, the capital of the Ashanti people, shortly after her wedding, she shunned the traditional British -- and Ghanaian-- role of homemaker, even as she reared her children, served as helpmate to her husband, kept the family going when he was in prison and established several philanthropies.         ''At one time there was an effort to deport her,'' said Henry Finder, editorial director of The New Yorker, who is Professor Appiah's companion. ''She said the airport was a long way away and she would kick and scream every inch of the way. Fearful of the publicity that would engender, they backed down.''         Known to many in Ghana as Auntie Peggy, Mrs. Appiah was a prolific writer of children's books, many of them based on the Ghanaian folk tales her husband told their children, as well as of novels, poetry and most recently a collection of 7,000 Ashanti proverbs, on which she collaborated with her son.         The book, published in English and Ashanti, had its origins in her collection of gold weights.         ''She collected weights used for weighing gold but made of brass,'' Professor Appiah said. ''Many of them had figurative art that came from proverbs. When a dealer came to the house, she would ask, 'What is the proverb?' and if he didn't know, she would eventually travel to the village to find out.''         Though she had a house in Brighton, England, Mrs. Appiah considered Ghana her home.         ''When my father died 15 years ago, people asked her, 'When are you going home?' '' her son said. ''She kept saying, 'I am home.' Finally she bought herself a plot of ground to be buried in, so when people said, 'When are you going home?,' she could answer: 'I am not going home. I have my burial plot here.' ''       
         Emilie Neumann Muse, who as a young woman exemplified the crazy, flamboyant competitiveness of the 20's and 30's by swimming in treacherous waters, wrestling alligators, jumping out of airplanes and being buried alive, died on Jan. 23 in East Patchogue, N.Y. She was 98.         The cause was complications of a stroke, her granddaughter Loretta Muse Dill said.         In later decades, Mrs. Muse was a dedicated homemaker whose interests included beekeeping and gardening. Her husband, Fred, did not want their children to know of her daredevil past for fear it might prove overly inspirational, and she herself did not share her stories until they were adults.         But the young Miss Neumann (pronounced NOY-man) exuberantly followed in the footsteps of Gertrude Ederle, also a longtime Bronx resident with a German background, who in 1926 became the first woman to swim the English Channel. In an epoch when breaking records and stretching human achievement were national passions, Miss Neumann in 1929 swam across the East River at the treacherous stretch known as Hell Gate and two weeks later swam for 24 hours straight in tidal waters.         Why?         ''For no reason at all, except that she wanted to be able to say that she had accomplished such a difficult feat,'' The New York Daily News said in the caption to a picture on Aug. 12, 1929.         Things quickly got more interesting, pretty much from the moment Miss Neumann met a man who called himself Alligator Jim because of his vocation of wrestling alligators for money.         Ms. Dill said no one in the family knows -- if anyone was ever told -- how her grandmother met the man. Alligator Jim soon taught Miss Neumann how to fly a plane, to parachute and land on a tiny target, and to wrestle alligators (as proved by a picture in The Albany Times Union on June 13, 1932). He then hit on the idea of burying her alive.         On Nov. 9, 1932, a Wednesday evening, Miss Neumann was buried at a marathon dance contest at the Casino ballroom in Reading, Pa. She weighed 125 pounds; when she was excavated 97 hours later, at 10 p.m. on Nov. 13, she weighed 114 and was very, very hungry.         She was also buried at air shows and other entertainment venues, as attested to by the many clippings in her scrapbook. At these times, she lay in a coffin with a glass window so people could gaze down at her.         Ms. Dill said she believed her grandmother followed Alligator Jim for a few action-packed years. She thinks he was in love with her, but is pretty sure the feeling was not reciprocated.         Romance came a few years later when Miss Neumann met Friedrich Wilhelm Muse, a ship's electrician who, while in port, happened by a bakery owned by family members. She was not initially enamored of Mr. Muse, but her competitive juices surged when her best friend, an attractive Frenchwoman, fell for him.         Mrs. Muse and the man who legally changed his name to Fred had four children and owned four homes when he died in 1975. Mrs. Muse is survived by two daughters, Juanita Fenninger and Diane Tax, both of Mahopac, N.Y.; a son, Robert Muse; eight grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren. Her son, Richard, died in 2002.         Emilie Neumann Muse was born on Jan. 14, 1908, in Bremen, Germany, and grew up in the Bronx when horses and buggies were a common sight. ''I'll try anything once,'' she liked to say. ''I'll taste it, I'll try it, I'll do it once.''         Correction:  March 8, 2006, Wednesday  An obituary on Feb. 26 about Emilie Neumann Muse, an adventurer and stuntwoman, misstated the date of her death and her husband's occupation. She died on Jan. 30, not Jan. 23, and her husband, the late Fred Muse, was a mechanical engineer, not a ship's electrician. The obituary also omitted the residence of her son, Robert. He lives in Mastic Beach, N.Y.       
         Sybille Bedford, whose first novel won high praise among England's literary elite and earned her a place in its most celebrated and exclusive literary circles, died Feb. 17 at a hospital near her home in London. She was 94.         Her death was announced by English PEN, part of the international society of writers, of which she was vice president at her death.         Ms. Bedford, who was German by birth and whose first language was German, wrote in English. In 53 years she published at least 10 books, many of them works that are combinations of biography, memoir or fact and not easily classifiable in any particular genre.         Though her works were not always widely popular, they inspired a deeply fervent following of committed admirers, starting with her first published work, ''A Sudden View,'' in 1953. Later retitled ''A Visit to Don Otavio,'' it was an account of her journey through Mexico.         Ms. Bedford's first published work of fiction, ''A Legacy'' (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1956), about aristocratic society in Germany before World War I, was heavily influenced by her own upbringing and gained attention after Evelyn Waugh's laudatory review of it in The Standard.         ''Written with an air of authority which compels acceptance, a novel has just appeared by a new writer of remarkable accomplishment,'' he wrote at the time. He called it ''a book of entirely delicious quality.''         The book was also well reviewed by Nancy Mitford, Aldous Huxley and other highly respected authors of the day. Their praise immediately elevated Ms. Bedford's literary reputation and made the book a commercial success. Her prose, called elegant by even her harshest critics, was compared to that of Marcel Proust, Henry James and Thomas Mann.         ''A Legacy'' and her three later novels were not universally celebrated. Critics sometimes found them lacking in character development and said that her plots seemed elitist and outdated.         A novelist and critic, Richard Plant, who reviewed ''A Legacy'' for The New York Times Book Review in 1957, said, ''If there existed an annual award for snobbery, this year's prize, in this reviewer's opinion, should go to Sybille Bedford.''         Her nonfiction work was more widely acclaimed. She covered more than 100 trials for publications s like Life, Esquire, The Observer and The Saturday Evening Post, and reported on the obscenity trial involving the British publication of ''Lady Chatterley's Lover,'' the trial of Jack L. Ruby and the Auschwitz trial at Frankfurt in 1963-64, among others.         Her book ''The Trial of Dr. Adams'' (Simon & Schuster, 1958), sometimes titled ''The Best We Can Do: The Trial of Dr. Adams,'' retold one of England's most famous court cases: Dr. John Bodkin Adams, whose patients included rich, older women who often left him in their wills, was accused of murdering an elderly patient and was ultimately acquitted.         She published a two-part biography of her longtime friend, Aldous Huxley, in 1973. Ms. Bedford's last novel, ''Jigsaw: An Unsentimental Education'' (Hamish Hamilton, 1989), was a finalist for the Booker Prize. Her final book, ''Quicksands: A Memoir,'' was published last year.         In 1963 she was named a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. The group elected her a Companion of Literature in 1994, a position held by only 10 writers at a time.         Sybille von Schoenebeck was born in Charlottenburg, Germany, in 1911. Her mother and father were separated, and after her father died, when she was 10, she lived with her mother in Italy. She was sent to England for an education she said never took place, and was largely self-educated. She considered England her home, and through a brief marriage to Walter Bedford in the 1930's, she officially became a British citizen. She was also a serious wine expert, traveling to France often for wine tastings. Throughout her life she lived around the world, including Italy, France, Portugal and the United States, before settling for good in London. She leaves no survivors.       
         Barbara Guest, a prominent modernist poet who was the only woman to be a member of the famed New York School of poets of the late 1950's and early 60's, died on Feb. 15 in Berkeley, Calif. She was 85. Ms. Guest, who had lived in Berkeley for the last decade, formerly resided in Manhattan and Southampton, N.Y.         The cause was complications of a recent series of strokes, her daughter, Hadley Guest, said.         The author of more than 20 volumes of poetry, Ms. Guest was part of the first generation of the New York School, together with John Ashbery, Kenneth Koch, Frank O'Hara and James Schuyler. Long considered a ''poet's poet,'' she was widely admired by colleagues but less well known to the general public.         In recent years, Ms. Guest attracted a new following, especially with the publication in 1995 of her ''Selected Poems'' (Sun & Moon Press). In 1999, she was awarded the Robert Frost Medal of the Poetry Society of America.         Her best-known poetry collections include ''The Blue Stairs'' (Corinth Books, 1968); ''The Countess From Minneapolis'' (Burning Deck Poetry Series, 1976); ''Fair Realism'' (Sun & Moon, 1989); and, most recently, ''The Red Gaze'' (Wesleyan University Press, 2005).         Ms. Guest was also known as the author of ''Herself Defined'' (Doubleday, 1984), a biography of Hilda Doolittle, better known as the poet H. D. Reviewing the book in The New York Times, Michiko Kakutani called it ''a shimmering, delicately patterned narrative that is never less than absorbing,'' though she expressed reservations over its relative lack of critical analysis.         The New York School emerged partly as a reaction against the angst-ridden work of the confessional poets of the late 1950's, among them John Berryman and Robert Lowell and, somewhat later, Anne Sexton and Sylvia Plath. In contrast, the New York poets shared a concern with language as pure form, using words much as a painter uses paint.         Not surprisingly, these poets, Ms. Guest among them, were deeply influenced by the visual art of the period. They saw a particular affinity between their work and that of action painters like Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning and Larry Rivers.         In 1960, Ms. Guest attracted favorable notice with her first collection of poems, ''The Location of Things'' (Tibor de Nagy Editions). But by the end of the decade, the spotlight had shifted to poets like Denise Levertov and Adrienne Rich, whose work was overtly political.         Ms. Guest's poetry is intended for both the eye and the ear, straddling the border between the painterly and the musical. Her work defies easy interpretation or, in some cases, any interpretation. It is meant to.         Like Gertrude Stein, Ms. Guest wielded English as Picasso wielded a brush, and the result can be hard-edged and fractured, almost Cubist, as in the opening stanza of ''Heavy Violets,'' from ''Fair Realism'':         Heavy violets there is no way         if the door clicks the cushion         makes murmur noise and the woman         on the sofa turns half in half out         a tooth slipping from velvet.         Barbara Ann Pinson was born on Sept. 6, 1920, in Wilmington, N.C. Her girlhood was rootless: her father was a probation officer, and the family moved wherever his job took him. After spending her early childhood in various Florida towns, Barbara was sent at 11 to live with relatives in Los Angeles, so that she could be educated there.         After attending the University of California, Los Angeles, she earned a bachelor's degree in English from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1943. She later moved to New York and for several years in the early 1950's was a reviewer for the journal Art News.         Ms. Guest's first marriage, to John Dudley, a painter and writer who was a close friend of Henry Miller's, ended in divorce. In 1948, she married Stephen Guest, an Englishman who later became Stephen Lord Haden-Guest. They were divorced in 1954. That year, Ms. Guest married Trumbull Higgins, a military historian; their marriage ended with his death in 1990.         Besides her daughter, of Berkeley, Ms. Guest is survived by a son, Jonathan Higgins of Eugene, Ore.         Her other work includes an experimental novel, ''Seeking Air'' (Black Sparrow Press, 1978); ''Dürer in the Window'' (Roof Books, 2003), a collection of poetry, essays and art criticism; and several books done in collaboration with visual artists.       
         Cindy Walker, a country songwriter whose pure, plainspoken lyrics of romance, heartbreak and picturesque prairies were recorded by major artists like Bing Crosby, Elvis Presley and Willie Nelson, making Top-40 country or pop charts more than 400 times, died on March 23 in Mexia, Tex.         She was 87, but did not broadcast her birthdate any more than the brief marriage she sometimes confirmed and sometimes did not. Her niece Carol Adams reported her death, The Associated Press said.         Until the 1990's, it was easier to count the number of country stars who had not recorded Cindy Walker songs than those who had, Texas Monthly observed in 1999. She had Top 10 hits in every decade from the 1940's to the 1980's.         Even as country music veered in louder, brasher directions, her continuing appeal to traditionalists is suggested by Mr. Nelson's release this year of an album of her songs, ''You Don't Know Me: The Songs of Cindy Walker.''         The title song was a hit for Eddy Arnold in 1956, Ray Charles in 1962 and Mickey Gilley in 1981, and was re-recorded by Mr. Charles with Diana Krall for his best-selling 2004 album of duets, ''Genius Loves Company.'' Presley, Van Morrison, Patti Page, Roy Orbison, Kenny Rogers and Emmylou Harris are among others who have recorded the tune.         It told of a man too shy to tell his true feelings to a female friend:         You give your hand to me         And then you say hello         And I can hardly speak         My heart is beating so         And anyone could tell         You think you know me well,         But you don't know me.         Writing on a floral-patterned typewriter, she produced a string of other sentimental standards like ''Cherokee Maiden,'' ''In the Misty Moonlight,'' ''Dream Baby,'' ''Jim, I Wore a Tie Today'' and ''Distant Drums.'' Gene Autry and other singing cowboys crooned her lyrics onscreen, and Bob Wills, patron saint of western swing, recorded more than 50 of her tunes, some of which he helped write.         Her songs have many times crossed over to pop to be recorded by Bette Midler, the Byrds, Cher and Michael Bolton, among other stars.         Harlan Howard, himself often called the greatest country songwriter, deferred to Ms. Walker when both were inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1997. He called her ''the greatest living songwriter of country music.''         Fred Foster, Mr. Orbison's producer and the discoverer of Dolly Parton, the only woman songwriter whose output rivals Ms. Walker's, said in an interview with The Austin American-Statesman in 2004, ''Cindy Walker has never written a bad song in her life.''         Howard once called a great country song ''three chords and the truth,'' and Ms. Walker's life sounds as if it springs from that formula. A granddaughter of the hymn writer F. L. Eiland (''Hold to God's Unchanging Hand''), she was born on July 20, 1918, on a farm near Mart, Tex. By age 12, she was composing songs on her Martin guitar.         On a family trip to Hollywood in 1940, she barged into Bing Crosby's studio and sold him a song, ''Lone Star Trail,'' which he recorded. Within weeks, she had her own record deal, with Decca.         From 1942 to 1944, she wrote 39 songs for Wills's western movies; was a movie actress herself; and, in 1944, wrote her first Top-10 country hit, ''You're From Texas,'' which Wills performed. She also recorded a hit herself in 1944, ''When My Blue Moon Turns to Gold Again,'' a song she did not write.         In 1954, she moved to Mexia, near her East Texas birthplace. There she lived in a modest three-bedroom house with her mother, Oree, and rose at dawn, made herself black coffee and went upstairs to write.         She was as proficient at pushing songs as writing them. Each year for decades, she and her mother would set up shop in an apartment in Nashville for five months or so to market songs. They would sweeten deals by inviting music industry people by for a plate or two of her mother's delectable Southern cooking.         Oree Walker was her best friend and, until her death, in 1991, worked out melodies for her daughter's words. Some suggested that Ms. Walker's declining output in later years was a result of Oree's absence.         Ms. Walker guarded her privacy. When she granted interviews, she stipulated that her age not be given. She worried that she might be regarded as too old to write contemporary songs.         Many articles about her, often based on interviews, say she never married. In an interview with The New York Times this year, however, she said she had had a ''short-lived marriage'' but declined to discuss it. She is survived by three nieces.         Ms. Walker did not consider herself a feminist pioneer; she often said that the music industry would welcome a potential hit written by anyone, even an orangutan. She declined to hang her awards on the wall. She kept them under her bed.         ''Worldly things were of little meaning,'' her niece Ms. Adams told The Associated Press. ''She lived for hamburgers, ice cream, pencil and paper.''       
         Doris Muscatine, a pioneering chronicler of California's wine and food culture, died Saturday at her home in Berkeley, Calif. She was 80.         Her family said she died as a result of injuries suffered in a fall this month.         Mrs. Muscatine began writing about food and wine in the 1960's, before anyone knew a pinot noir from a merlot or had ever heard of Alice Waters, Chez Panisse and the new American cooking. Her writing helped introduce California cooking, with its emphasis on fresh, locally grown ingredients, to the rest of the country.         ''Doris was a good kind of critic, looking for the positive things,'' said Ms. Waters, the executive chef and owner of Chez Panisse, in Berkeley. ''She was able to sort them out. She was never into the kind of superficial things about food and wine. She wanted to know about the person who ran the restaurant, its history, not just recipes. And that connects to her interest in history.''         As a friend of Ms. Waters, she peeled garlic every year for Chez Panisse's annual garlic festival.         She was an accomplished cook who thought that good ingredients could speak for themselves.         ''Food for her was really a form of cultural and aesthetic expression, one that gave comfort and meaning to peoples' daily lives,'' said her daughter, Lissa Muscatine.         Her food and wine books, which won many awards, include ''A Cook's Tour of Rome,'' ''A Cook's Tour of San Francisco'' and ''The University of California/Sotheby Book of California Wine.''         Mrs. Muscatine was also co-author, with the East Bay restaurateur Narsai David, of ''Monday Night at Narsai's.'' Narsai's was one of the area's most popular restaurants in the 1970's and early 80's.         Until a few weeks ago, Mrs. Muscatine was appearing at book signings to promote her new book, ''The Vinegar of Spilamberto and Other Italian Adventures with Food, Places and People,'' which was published last year by Shoemaker & Hoard.         The book recounts her many visits to Italy, the first in 1958, when her husband, Charles, began studying there on a Fulbright scholarship. With their young children, they explored the country and began a lifelong love of Italian culture, especially its food.         As a historian, Mrs. Muscatine wrote ''Old San Francisco: the Biography of a City From Early Days to the Earthquake'' and was a consultant for the PBS series ''California Dream,'' a history of the state first broadcast in 1981.         She recently completed a culinary oral history and film for the Bancroft Library at the University of California.         Born Doris Corn in New York City, she was reared in Trenton and graduated from Bennington College in Vermont. She studied cooking at the Cordon Bleu in Paris in 1962. She moved to the Bay Area in 1948, when her husband joined the faculty of the University of California, Berkeley.         In addition to her husband and daughter, of Bethesda, Md., she is survived by a son, Jeff, of Palo Alto, Calif., and six grandchildren.       
         Dana Reeve, who devoted herself to the care of her paralyzed husband, the actor Christopher Reeve, and became a forceful advocate for research into spinal cord injuries, died on Monday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 44 and lived in Pound Ridge, N.Y., in Westchester County.         The hospital said Ms. Reeve died of lung cancer, which was discovered last year, 10 months after Christopher Reeve's death.         Ms. Reeve, a singer and an actress, won international admiration for her devotion to Mr. Reeve's care and for her involvement in the Christopher Reeve Foundation, which seeks a cure for spinal cord paralysis. She succeeded her husband as chairman of the foundation and established the Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Resource Center, an information clearinghouse.         Mr. Reeve, whose most celebrated role was as the title hero in the ''Superman'' movie franchise, was paralyzed after a 1995 horseback riding accident in Virginia. He died on Oct. 10, 2004, in New York at age 52.         Ms. Reeve, who had never smoked, expressed optimism about overcoming her cancer. ''I'm beating the odds and defying every statistic the doctors can throw at me,'' she said four months ago in one of her few public statements about her condition. ''My prognosis looks better all the time.''         Ms. Reeve was born in 1961 in Teaneck, N.J., one of three daughters of Dr. Charles Morosini and Helen Morosini, who died of ovarian cancer early last year. She grew up in Scarsdale, N.Y., graduated cum laude from Middlebury College in Vermont in 1984 and studied at the California Institute of the Arts.         The couple met in 1987 in Williamstown, Mass., where Christopher saw Dana performing in a cabaret act at the Williamstown Theater Festival. They were married on April 11, 1992, in an outdoor ceremony at a farm in South Williamstown. They had a son, Will, now 13.         In addition to her son and her father, Ms. Reeve is survived by her sisters, Deborah Morosini and Adrienne Morosini Heilman, and two stepchildren, Matthew and Alexandra.         She appeared both on Broadway and Off Broadway at the Public Theater, the Manhattan Theater Club and the Ensemble Studio Theater. She also acted at such regional theaters as the Yale Repertory Theater and the New Jersey Shakespeare Festival. On television she appeared in shows including ''Law and Order,'' ''Oz'' and ''All My Children,'' and was a co-host for ''Lifetime Live,'' a program on the Lifetime network.         Ms. Reeve essentially suspended her career after her husband's accident, choosing to oversee his care and campaign for spinal cord research, but she did make several appearances after his death. On Jan. 12, wearing what she described as her ''Barbarella wig,'' she sang ''Now and Forever'' to a sold-out crowd at Madison Square Garden on behalf of a friend, the former Rangers hockey captain Mark Messier, who was honored in a retirement ceremony.         Ms. Reeve will be seen on March 29 in a PBS program, ''The New Medicine,'' which was taped in November. In its introduction, she says, ''It has become clear to me that high-tech medicine, with all its wonders, often leaves out that all-important human touch.''         Her interest in preserving humane approaches to life in the face of disability was reflected in her work at the Christopher Reeve Foundation.         ''She navigated the difficulties in their lives, so she decided she wanted to do something to help people living with paralysis and established the Quality of Life grants program,'' said Maggie Goldberg, spokeswoman for the foundation. The program has awarded $8 million to nonprofit organizations that help people with disabilities, Ms. Goldberg said.         ''Chris was all about research, research, cure and treatment,'' Ms. Goldberg said. ''Dana said, 'We need to worry about the here and now.' ''       
         Maureen Stapleton, who created a gallery of pugnacious, sometimes profane but always vulnerable heroines on Broadway, in films and on television and who won an Academy Award for her fiery performance as the anarchist Emma Goldman in ''Reds,'' died yesterday at her home in Lenox, Mass. She was 80.         The cause was chronic pulmonary disease, said her son, Daniel Allentuck.         Ms. Stapleton had one of the most honored acting careers of her generation. Her Academy Award for ''Reds,'' Warren Beatty's 1981 epic about the Russian Revolution, came on her fourth Oscar nomination. She also won two Tony Awards and an Emmy among many nominations.         Ms. Stapleton's story embodied the classic theatrical cliché. A small-town girl nurtured on long afternoons at the movies, she came to New York in 1943 with dreams of becoming a star in the theater. She worked at a variety of jobs -- salesgirl, hotel clerk, artists' model -- while attending acting school. Then, not long after her theatrical baptism in summer stock and a few small roles on Broadway, fortune smiled.         It was 1950. Tennessee Williams had written a play called ''The Rose Tattoo,'' and he wanted the renowned Italian actress Anna Magnani to play the lead role, that of Serafina Delle Rose, an earthy Sicilian-American widow looking for love. But Magnani declined, fearing that her English was inadequate for Broadway. Other actresses were auditioned, without success. Harold Clurman, who had directed Ms. Stapleton earlier that year in Arthur Laurents's ''Bird Cage,'' suggested that the producers audition her. After repeated callbacks, she was told she had the part.         A friend from acting school, Eli Wallach, was cast opposite her as Alvaro Mangiacavallo, the simple but loving truck driver who revives the widow's spirits in a tumultuous courtship.         ''The Rose Tattoo'' opened at the Martin Beck Theater in February 1951. Brooks Atkinson, writing in The New York Times, called the performance ''triumphant'' and praised her ability to convey not only the coarseness of the plainspoken Serafina but also her moments of exaltation. The play ran for 300 performances then toured for six months.         ''The Rose Tattoo'' fulfilled Ms. Stapleton's childhood dream of becoming a star and also earned her a Tony Award. But the stress of her first major role also introduced the demons that would pursue her throughout her career. She began to drink, though she always maintained that she drank only after a performance. (She routinely vomited before curtain time.) She also became convinced that someday, someone in the audience was going to kill her.         Ms. Stapleton's growing paranoia led her to seek out a psychotherapist after the show ended its tour, but a cure for her ills -- she also had a lifelong fear of elevators and airplanes -- proved elusive. One therapist was to treat her for 14 years.         Despite her problems with alcohol and bouts of anxiety, her life seemed to be on a positive track. She married Max Allentuck, general manager for the producer Kermit Bloomgarden. They had a son, Daniel, and a daughter, Katherine. When word came that Williams was ready with a new play, ''Orpheus Descending,'' she was told once again that he wanted Magnani to play the heroine, a frustrated Italian-American storekeeper in a small Southern town whose world is torn apart by the arrival of a handsome newcomer. Magnani declined again, and the role went to Ms. Stapleton.         The play opened on Broadway in March 1957 and drew mixed reviews, but Ms. Stapleton won raves in the lead role of Lady Torrance, Williams's gritty, sex-starved heroine. Cliff Robertson played Val Xavier, the handsome interloper.         The following year she had audiences laughing in the S. N. Behrman comedy ''The Cold Wind and the Warm,'' in which she played a freewheeling matchmaker. She also received her first Emmy nomination for her work in a television adaptation of ''All the King's Men.'' Then Hollywood beckoned, and in her very first film, an adaptation of Nathaniel West's ''Miss Lonelyhearts'' (1959), she was nominated for an Academy Award for best supporting actress, playing a deceitful man-eater.         In 1959 she and Mr. Allentuck were divorced, and she began a relationship with the playwright David Rayfiel, whom she eventually married. But guilt and anxiety over her divorce, she said, drove her further into alcoholism and indulgence. Her weight ballooned. Liquor was a fixture in her dressing room. ''The curtain came down and I went into the vodka,'' she told an interviewer. She later said that in many ways she had been reliving a painful childhood.         Lois Maureen Stapleton was born on June 21, 1925, in Troy, N.Y. She remembered her father, John, as ''a prodigious drinker'' who had endless battles with her mother, Irene, until they separated when Maureen was a child. She was an unhappy, overweight girl who spent hours at the movies, where, she said, she would ''dream myself right onto the screen.'' She fantasized about someday becoming a Jean Harlow or a Barbara Stanwyck.         When she was old enough to work, her goal was to save $100 to move to New York City and become an actress; in 1943, she left Troy for Manhattan, where she and a friend shared a $45-a-month apartment.         ''I was 17 years old, I weighed 180 pounds and I had a hundred bucks in my pocket,'' she recalled. ''I was invincible.''         She enrolled at the New School, where she studied acting with Herbert Berghof, and in 1947 joined the Actors Studio. But she eventually grew impatient with some of the excesses of Lee Strasberg's Method approach to acting. Even so, she remembered the Studio as ''a special working place.'' Her colleagues included Montgomery Clift, Julie Harris, Marlon Brando, Anne Jackson and Mr. Wallach, and her apartment became an actors' hangout. It was among the happiest times of her life.         Once established on Broadway and in films and television, she was rarely idle. She appeared on Broadway with Jason Robards in Lillian Hellman's ''Toys in the Attic'' in 1960 and in the film version of ''Orpheus,'' retitled ''The Fugitive Kind.'' Williams got his wish, though, and Anna Magnani played Lady Torrance onscreen while Ms. Stapleton settled for a lesser role. Ms. Stapleton had an earlier disappointment when Magnani won an Academy Award for best actress as Serafina in the 1955 film version of ''The Rose Tattoo.''         By this time, she was married again, to Mr. Rayfiel, but her drinking was out of control. She was hospitalized for detoxification, after which she voluntarily entered a psychiatric facility. Her second marriage lasted three years. A few months after her divorce, she returned to the role that had made her a star, appearing as Serafina opposite Harry Guardino in a revival of ''The Rose Tattoo'' at the City Center.         In 1967 she won an Emmy for her television work in ''Among the Paths to Eden,'' an adaptation of a Truman Capote story about a spinster and a widower. (When an interviewer asked her if she minded being regularly cast as an older woman -- something that began early in her career -- she merely shrugged and said, ''I was born old.'')         A year later she was cast opposite George C. Scott in Neil Simon's comedy ''Plaza Suite,'' staged by Mike Nichols. She and Mr. Scott played three different warring couples to hilarious effect, and her performance won her another Tony nomination.         The awards and nominations kept coming. She was nominated for an Oscar as best supporting actress for ''Airport'' (1970); she won a best-actress Tony that same year for her portrayal of an alcoholic down-and-out singer in Mr. Simon's laughing-through-tears drama ''The Gingerbread Lady''; she and her co-star, Charles Durning, received Emmy nominations for ''Queen of the Stardust Ballroom'' (1975), playing a couple who warm to romance when they meet at a dance hall.         Another Oscar nomination, for supporting actress, followed her work in Woody Allen's 1978 drama, ''Interiors.'' In 1981, she was nominated for a Tony for ''The Little Foxes,'' in which she played the battered Aunt Birdie opposite Elizabeth Taylor in the lead role, Regina. In his review in The Times, Frank Rich called her ''a wonder'' and added, ''such is this actress's talent that she can conjure abject terror out of silence and thin air.'' It turned out to be her last appearance on Broadway.         But her movie career continued, perhaps most memorably as the revolutionary Goldman in ''Reds.'' The performance won her the Oscar for best supporting actress. Her film credits also included ''Cocoon'' (1985) and its sequel, as one of a group of Florida retirees rejuvenated by extraterrestrials, and ''Nuts'' (1987), in which she played the mother of a high-priced call girl (Barbra Streisand).         When her grandchildren were born, Ms. Stapleton moved to Lenox to be near family, namely her daughter, Katharine Allentuck Bambery, her grandson Max and her granddaughter Alexandra, all of whom survive her, along with her son, Daniel, of Manhattan, and a brother, John, of Troy. (She was not related to the actress Jean Stapleton, as many people have thought.)         In Lenox she doted on her grandchildren and continued to accept the occasional role, playing a woman dying of ovarian cancer in the television drama ''Last Wish'' (1992) and appearing opposite Armin Mueller-Stahl in the 1994 film ''The Last Good Time.''         She also wrote her autobiography, ''A Hell of a Life,'' with Jane Scovell in 1995, in which she looked back on a life in the theater with a few regrets but a lot of satisfaction. When the curtain went up or the camera rolled, she said, ''I did the best I could.''         But what she loved most, she wrote, was ''the challenge and the opportunity to leave reality behind and become someone else.''         Correction:  March 20, 2006, Monday  An obituary of the actress Maureen Stapleton on Tuesday misspelled the given name of the author of the novel that inspired her first film, ''Miss Lonelyhearts.'' He was Nathanael West, not Nathaniel.       
         Stella Snead, a British Surrealist painter and collage artist who fled wartime Europe to work in the United States and later became a photographer noted for her books on India, died on March 18 in New York. She was 96.         Her dealer, Pavel Zoubok, said she died of natural causes at the Jewish Home and Hospital in Manhattan.         Ms. Snead's paintings of the 1940's -- nocturnal, dreamlike landscapes populated by fantastic animals and semi-human creatures -- reflected the influences of painters like Yves Tanguy and Max Ernst. Though not well remembered as a painter today, Ms. Snead exhibited her work frequently in the United States and Europe during that decade. In 1949, her work was included in the prestigious Carnegie International exhibition in Pittsburgh.         But in the 1950's, she abruptly stopped painting. The reason was depression, she later wrote in a reminiscence. She had suffered bouts of it before, she wrote, and now the breakup of a romantic relationship had set off another episode, draining her of her desire to paint. So she turned to photography.         In India, where she began making extended visits and where she lived throughout the 1960's, she took photographs of street life, nature and Hindu sculpture. She published eight books of photography, including ''Shiva's Pigeons: An Experience of India'' (Alfred A. Knopf, 1972) and ''Animals in Four Worlds: Sculptures from India'' (University of Chicago Press, 1989).         Stella Snead was born on April 2, 1910, in London. It was not until she was in her mid-20's that she decided to become a painter. She studied with the French abstract painter Amédée Ozenfant, who had opened an art school in London in 1936. The English Surrealist painter Leonora Carrington was a fellow student and a close friend.         In 1939, with the outbreak of war against Germany, Ms. Snead moved to the United States. She lived mainly in New York City and Taos, N.M., for the next decade. After returning from India in 1971, she resided permanently in Manhattan. She had no immediate survivors.         In the 60's and 70's, Ms. Snead produced collages from cut-up pieces of her own photographs. Some were published in a book, ''Can Drowning Be Fun? A Nonsense Book'' (Pont la Vue Press, 1992). And in the late 80's, after a hiatus of more than three decades, she began painting again, making copies from photographs of old paintings that had been lost or stolen.         Recognition also returned to her in her later years. Last year, one of her paintings from the 1940's was included in ''Surrealism USA,'' a major survey of American Surrealists at the National Academy Museum in New York.       
         Helen Hobbs Jordan, an exacting and tart-tongued music teacher who instructed generations of performers in ear training and theory, including Melissa Manchester, Bette Midler and Tony Bennett, died on Wednesday at her suite in the Salisbury Hotel, near Carnegie Hall. She was 99.         Mrs. Jordan left no immediate survivors, said Mary Jo Kaplan, a friend and former student, but her family was huge: a legion of devoted former pupils who tended to her needs.         One volunteered as her doctor, another as her accountant, another as her money manager. Others brought groceries and took her to dinner. Early last year, as Mrs. Jordan's money began running out, the group put on a benefit concert that raised more than $40,000, including large checks from Ms. Midler and Mr. Bennett.         For more than 50 years, Mrs. Jordan taught sight singing, score reading and other fundamentals. But she also drummed in different sorts of lessons, like the importance of decorum, honesty and the pursuit of perfection.         ''I don't tolerate errors,'' an elegantly dressed Mrs. Jordan said in an interview with The New York Times in January 2005. ''If you have a brain, for God's sake, use it.''         Her students included the guitarists Bucky Pizzarelli and Gene Bertoncini; the singers Lesley Gore and Paul Simon; and the actor and director Carl Reiner. Future stars and those who were already stars came to her to polish the basics.         Melissa Manchester said she studied sight singing with Mrs. Jordan in the early 1970's.         ''I was just so impressed by her strength and character and her desire for excellence,'' Ms. Manchester said. ''That's what she wanted for her students. I was sort of sloppy around the edges regarding my musicianship. But she kept me humble and clear-sighted in terms of really not compromising.''         Mrs. Jordan carved out a niche among jingle singers, teaching them how to walk into a studio and immediately master a singing line, without rehearsal, during expensive recording sessions.         ''She taught the top,'' said Ms. Kaplan, a producer at Showtime.         For years Mrs. Jordan conducted classes at Steinway Hall in Manhattan. She self-published more than a dozen books laying out her method.         Helen Hobbs was born in Topeka, Kan., on April 6, 1907. Her father, Charles Hobbs, was later elected Kansas insurance commissioner, and her mother, Emma Swisher, taught piano. She received her undergraduate degree in music from Washburn University in Topeka.         In the 1930's she moved to New York City to continue a career as a violinist, attending the Juilliard School and Teachers College at Columbia. At one point she gave concerts on long train trips, and she toured Europe before World War II.         She grew frustrated with the violin and spontaneously gave it away to a cab driver whose instrument had been stolen. She went on to lead the general musicianship department of the American Theater Wing's professional school.         Mrs. Jordan was briefly married to Robert Jordan, a lawyer, before they divorced in the early 1950's. She had a long relationship with David Collyer, a Broadway singer and teacher, who died in 1996, and to the end kept a publicity photograph of him in her sitting room. She was godmother to his daughter, Ingrid Saxon, and they remained close.         ''She just didn't want to play second fiddle to anybody,'' Ms. Manchester said. ''She just wanted to star in her own life, and I think she did.''       
         Maggie Dixon, who coached the women's basketball team at Army to its first N.C.A.A. tournament last month, died Thursday at Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla, N.Y. She was 28.         Dr. Millard J. Hyland, the Westchester County medical examiner, performed an autopsy yesterday and said afterward that the cause of death was, in part, an enlarged heart with a mitral valve that was not shutting properly.         Jamie Dixon, Maggie's older brother and the men's basketball coach at Pittsburgh, said she collapsed Wednesday while having tea at a friend's home.         She was taken to the Keller Army Community Hospital at West Point and was airlifted to Westchester Medical Center. He said that she had an arrhythmic episode, an irregular heartbeat, and that she had no history of heart problems.         The Dixons were the first brother and sister to coach in the N.C.A.A. tournaments in the same year.         After five years as an assistant at DePaul, Maggie Dixon became the Army coach in late September, 11 days before the first practice. She inherited a team with players who take up to 24 credits a semester in subjects like engineering, physics and calculus and have limited time for sports.         Her team started the season 5-7, including losses by 39 points to Connecticut and 17 to Baylor. She told her players that losing so badly would turn out to be a good thing. Three weeks ago, she recalled that speech for The New York Times this way:         ''We're just in the spot where we want to be,'' she said she told the team. ''Look, we've played some of the toughest teams in the country -- UConn, Baylor, Princeton -- and we've played well, even though we lost. We're just coming together as a team. We're learning to play with each other. We're gaining confidence.''         Her team won the Patriot League regular-season championship for the first time. It then won the conference tournament, and its automatic N.C.A.A. Division I tournament berth, for the first time.         After a 69-68 victory against Holy Cross in the Patriot League tournament final, Dixon was carried around the arena by Army football players. When she entered the dining room for dinner, she received a standing ovation from the corps of cadets.         In the first round of the N.C.A.A. tournament, her team was routed by Tennessee, a perennial national power, 102-54, and finished 20-11. In that game, Candace Parker of Tennessee made the first dunk in women's N.C.A.A. tournament history (she had two).         After the game, Dixon said: ''I'm looking forward to the future of Army basketball. They have accomplished too much to feel bad about this season.''         Tennessee Coach Pat Summitt said she was impressed by Dixon's work. ''You love the game and you love to teach the game, which she did very well,'' Summitt said.         Margaret Mary Dixon was born May 9, 1977, in North Hollywood, Calif., and grew up there. At the University of San Diego, the 5-foot-11 Dixon won four varsity letters in basketball and was the captain her senior year. She graduated with a degree in history in 1999. In May 2000, she was cut by the Los Angeles Sparks of the Women's National Basketball Association and later talked her way into an assistant's job at DePaul.         In addition to her brother, Dixon is survived by her parents, Jim and Marge Dixon of North Hollywood, and a sister, Julie.         Cara Enright, a guard on Dixon's team, said yesterday: ''I just loved the energy that Coach brought to practice every day and the way she never gave up on us, always believed in us. She would tell us to use what you've learned here at the academy and apply it to basketball.''       
         Joyce Ballantyne Brand, a commercial and pinup artist who created the famed Coppertone Girl advertisement, died on Monday at her home in Ocala, Fla. She was 88.         She suffered a heart attack late last week and had been released from the hospital under hospice care, her daughter Cheri Brand Irwin said.         Mrs. Brand was working for a New York firm, Grant Advertising, in 1959 when she was handed a rough drawing of stick figures and from that created the famous image for the Coppertone suntan lotion. It showed a dog tugging at the bathing suit of a little girl, exposing her bottom and tan line.         In a 1991 article in The Ocala Star-Banner, Mrs. Brand recalled earning $2,500 for the image, adding that Coppertone executives lost the drawings in a fire and she earned $2,000 more for recreating them.         The model in that piece of advertising history was none other than her daughter, Ms. Irwin, then 3. In the 1991 interview, Mrs. Brand said she used her daughter because she ''worked cheap and was convenient.''         The initial billboard campaign carried the slogan ''Don't Be a Paleface.'' The Schering-Plough Corporation, now the maker of Coppertone, has used other slogans, like ''Tan, Don't Burn,'' and over the years the little girl has become somewhat less exposed in the ads.         Ms. Irwin and her sister were often models for Mrs. Brand.         ''Personally I think her oil paintings were her best work but her commercial art is what made her famous,'' Ms. Irwin said.         Jocelyn Ballantyne Brand was born in Norfolk, Neb., and attended the University of Nebraska before finishing her art education at the American Academy of Art in Chicago and the Art Student League in New York City.         She was an illustrator for Sports Afield magazine for 20 years. In addition to creating the Coppertone Girl, she worked on campaigns for Pampers diapers, Ovaltine, Coca-Cola, Pepsi and General Motors.         She had lived in Ocala since the 1970's.         In addition to Ms. Irwin, Mrs. Brand's survivors include another daughter, Coby Reichstadt of Omaha; two grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. Jack Brand, her husband, died before her.         Ed Franklin, a longtime friend, said that Mrs. Brand did not particularly like being known for the Coppertone Girl ad, preferring to concentrate on fine art, mostly oil paintings. She also painted pinup girls.         ''She was an icon for women in a man's world especially when it came to her pinups,'' Mr. Franklin said. ''She was beautiful and used herself as a model for many of the pinups.''       
         Katherine Dunham, the dancer, choreographer, teacher and anthropologist whose pioneering work introduced much of the black heritage in dance to the stage, died Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 96.         Her death was confirmed by Dr. Glory Van Scott, a friend and former Dunham dancer. Miss Dunham also had homes in East St. Louis, Ill., where she had run inner-city cultural programs for decades, and in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.         By creating popular and glamorous revues based on African and Caribbean folklore, Miss Dunham acquainted audiences, both on Broadway and around the world, with the historical roots of black dance.         In the late 1930's she founded the nation's first self-supporting black modern-dance troupe, one that visited more than 50 countries on six continents. Her achievements came at a time of racial discrimination, which she fought against, refusing to return to segregated theaters in the South. ''We weren't pushing 'Black Is Beautiful,' we just showed it,'' she once wrote. One of her works, ''Southland,'' depicted a lynching.         Miss Dunham also became attached to Haiti and its culture, first arriving there as a young anthropologist. She later became a priestess of the Vaudun religion. In 1992, at the age of 82 and suffering from arthritis, she staged a much-publicized 47-day hunger strike to protest repatriation of Haitian refugees.         In East St. Louis, she found talented young people living in one of the nation's most destitute areas and turned them into dancers. Describing her work there, she said her aim was ''to make the individual aware of himself and his environment, to create a desire to be alive.''         Miss Dunham was a recipient of some of the most prestigious awards in the arts, including the Presidential Medal of the Arts, the Albert Schweitzer Prize (presented at Carnegie Hall), Kennedy Center Honors and decorations from the French and Haitian governments.         In her dance technique, Miss Dunham emphasized the isolation of individual parts of the body. Some of her concepts continue to be taught at modern-dance schools across America. Her work was an important influence on Alvin Ailey, among other contemporary choreographers.         George Balanchine cast Miss Dunham in a major role in ''Cabin in the Sky,'' a Broadway musical starring Ethel Waters, which he staged and choreographed in 1940. She then went to Hollywood and danced in and choreographed the movies ''Carnival of Rhythm'' (1941), ''Star-Spangled Rhythm'' (1942) and ''Stormy Weather'' (1943), among others. It was in the 40's that Miss Dunham developed the fast-paced shows for which she was celebrated. ''Tropical Revue,'' successfully produced on Broadway in 1943, also toured the nation to much acclaim. Its sensuality also drew complaints, and it was cut, and finally closed, in Boston.         Miss Dunham was born on June 22, 1909 in Glen Ellyn, Ill. Her father, Albert Millard Dunham, was a descendant of slaves from Madagascar and West Africa. Her French Canadian mother, Fanny June Taylor, died when Miss Dunham was young. Her father then married Annette Poindexter, a schoolteacher from Iowa, and moved his family to predominantly white Joliet, Ill., where he ran a dry-cleaning business.         Always interested in the theater, Miss Dunham shocked neighbors when, at 15, she announced she would stage a ''cabaret party'' to aid a Methodist Church. Later, she confessed that she had scarcely known what ''cabaret'' meant.         Miss Dunham attended Joliet Junior College and the University of Chicago, where she received her bachelor's degree, going on to a doctorate in anthropology there. She also studied dance in Chicago with Ludmilla Speranzeva and Mark Turbyfill, a choreographer and poet, with whom she established the short-lived Ballet Nègre in 1930. Ruth Page, a prominent Chicago choreographer, cast her in ''La Guiablesse,'' a ballet based on Martinique folklore that was performed at the Chicago Civic Opera House in 1933.         The following year, Miss Speranzeva helped Miss Dunham establish the Chicago Negro School of Ballet and a company, the Negro Dance Group, which evolved into the Katherine Dunham Dance Company. She did her anthropological field work in the Caribbean as a graduate student in 1935, receiving a Rosenwald Fellowship to study traditional dances in Jamaica, Martinique, Trinidad and Haiti, where she became close to Haitians and took up the Vaudun religion. Over the years Miss Dunham spent much time in Haiti and in 1961 established a medical clinic there.         In the United States, she worked with the Federal Theater in Chicago, where she met John Pratt, an artist and designer to whom she was married from 1941 until his death in 1986. He also managed her career. Their daughter, Marie Christine Dunham Pratt, of Rome, who survives her.         Miss Dunham took her Negro Dance Group to New York in 1937 but did not attract wide attention there until 1939, when she choreographed ''Pins and Needles,'' a satirical revue produced by the International Ladies Garment Workers Union.         Her popular appearance on Broadway as Georgia Brown in ''Cabin in the Sky'' at the Martin Beck Theater led to Hollywood and her celebrated revues of the early 40's. Later revues included ''Carib Song'' (1945), ''Bal Nègre'' (1946), ''Caribbean Rhapsody'' (1948) and ''Bamboche'' (1962). They consisted of brief, vivid numbers inspired by African, Caribbean or African-American dance forms. In 1945, she founded the Dunham School of Dance and Theater in New York. Until it closed a decade later, it offered courses in dance, acting, psychology, philosophy, music, design and foreign languages.         After World War II, her dance company toured constantly, visiting more than 50 countries in 30 years. ''Judging from reactions,'' she said at one point, ''the dancing of my group is called anthropology in New Haven, sex in Boston and in Rome -- art!''         She also continued to choreograph in New York. In 1963 she became the first African-American to choreograph at the Metropolitan Opera since 1934, startling audiences with her lusty dances for a production of Verdi's ''Aida.'' Writing in The New York Times, the critic Allen Hughes said: ''There is 'modern' in it, belly-dancing, the foot-stamping and hip-and-shoulder shaking of primitive African dancing and much more. All pure Dunham.''         Miss Dunham began an association with Southern Illinois University in 1964 when she choreographed Gounod's ''Faust'' at the Carbondale campus. In 1967, she moved to its Edwardsville campus and founded the Performing Arts Training Center in nearby East St. Louis.         She did more than offer courses there. Her collection of African and Haitian art became the basis for the community's Katherine Dunham Dynamic Museum, which opened there in the late-1970's. She also counseled disadvantaged young people, and her colleagues noted that she could calm the angriest of them through the sheer power of her presence, making her ordinarily soft voice even softer -- yet always firm -- as the counseling session proceeded. Miss Dunham was also the author of many books, some published under the pseudonym Kaye Dunn. Her books including ''Journey to Accompong'' (1946), ''A Touch of Innocence: Memoirs of Childhood'' (1959), ''Island Possessed'' (1969) and ''Dances of Haiti'' (1984).         Miss Dunham remained relatively active in her last years. On May 11, she appeared at the Morgan Library in Manhattan for a screening of ''Oprah Winfrey's Legends Ball,'' an ABC special, broadcast on Monday, celebrating Ms. Winfrey's personal heroes, Miss Dunham among them. She was resplendent in a kente-inflected robe set off with a large paisley scarf.         Earlier in the month she had appeared at La Boule Blanche (the White Ball) at Riverside Church, an event organized by her friend Dr. Scott to celebrate the publication of an anthology of writings by and about Miss Dunham. The book, ''Kaiso!,'' edited by VèVè A. Clark and Sara E. Johnson, was recently released by University of Wisconsin Press. The title is a Calypso expression meaning, ''Bravo!''         Correction:  June 1, 2006, Thursday  An obituary on May 23 about the dancer and choreographer Katherine Dunham omitted a credit for the choreography in the 1940 Broadway musical ''Cabin in the Sky,'' in which she performed. It was by George Balanchine in collaboration with Miss Dunham; it was not solely by Balanchine. Because of an editing error, the obituary misidentified an award Miss Dunham received in 1979 at Carnegie Hall. It was the Albert Schweitzer Music Award, not the Albert Schweitzer Prize.       
         Carlene R. Lewis, a Houston lawyer whose early suspicions about the safety of the pain reliever Vioxx put her in the forefront of what is now a wave of litigation against its maker, Merck, died Monday in Houston. She was 51.         The cause was complications of ovarian cancer, according to her husband, Greg Lewis.         Ms. Lewis first began looking into possible dangers of Vioxx in the fall of 2000. She investigated claims that Vioxx increased the risk of heart attacks and strokes in long-term users. Five years later, in August 2005, she was part of a team of three lawyers that won a verdict of $253.5 million against Merck in a state court in Texas, one of the largest damage awards ever to a single plaintiff.         The Association of American Trial Lawyers said yesterday that before her death Ms. Lewis had been chosen to receive its annual award for public service for her efforts against Vioxx. Her family is to accept the award at the association's convention in Seattle.         ''This is a story of her determination,'' said Miriam Bourdette, a member of the association's board of governors. ''She got a lot of other lawyers involved in this at a very early stage.''         Merck has said it will appeal the Texas case and two others it has lost. Two juries have ruled in its favor. More than 20 million people had taken Vioxx before Merck took it off the market in September 2004, and the company is facing 11,500 lawsuits in behalf of 23,000 plaintiffs. About a dozen cases are scheduled for trial before the end of this year.         Christopher Seeger, a New York lawyer who joined forces with Ms. Lewis against Vioxx in 2001, said: ''She was the first lawyer I know to begin investing money and really investigating whether Vioxx was a safe drug or whether it was causing heart attacks. She concluded in 2001 that this drug ought to be off the market and she was vindicated in 2004.''         Ms. Lewis starting investigating Vioxx after a friend of her mother's said she had become ill after taking the drug and soon lost her job, according to Shelly Sanford, one of her law partners. Ms. Lewis wrote two letters to Merck seeking to negotiate a settlement in behalf of her mother's friend, Ms. Sanford said, but both offers were rejected.         ''Then she went about the litigation process,'' Ms. Sanford said.         As lawsuits against Merck began to multiple, Ms. Lewis was appointed by a federal judge to a panel of lawyers charged with overseeing the gathering of records concerning Vioxx from the company. She was also appointed to a similar panel in connection with litigation against Pfizer involving the drug Bextra, which, like Vioxx belongs to a class of pain-reducing drugs known as cox-2 inhibitors.         Carlene Rhodes Lewis was born in Philadelphia on Sept. 28, 1954. She graduated with honors from Harvard in 1976 and received an award as the outstanding female athlete of her class. She taught at the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Conn., before going to law school at the University of Virginia. She graduated in 1983.         In 1984, she joined the firm of Sewell & Riggs in Houston and specialized in defending corporations in product liability suits. Five years later, she and a colleague at Sewell & Riggs, Daniel Goforth, formed the firm now known as Goforth Lewis Sanford. She eventually focused on representing plaintiffs.         Besides her husband, Ms. Lewis is survived by two daughters, Carla and Christy; her mother, Alene Rhodes of Houston; and her brother, Tim Rhodes of South Shores, N.C.       
         Leslie Hansen Kopp, a dance and music archivist, died on May 27 in Manhattan. She was 53.         The cause was breast cancer, said George Boziwick, a friend and the chief of the music division at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center.         Born in Newport News, Va., Ms. Kopp received a master's degree in musicology from Temple University. In 1988, with Michael Scherker, she founded Preserve Inc., an organization that taught performing arts organizations and interested people how to create and maintain archives, and conducted workshops nationwide. She became its director.         In 1998 Preserve sponsored the Decade of Dance Preservation Symposium, a conference that featured panels of dancers, scholars, archivists, librarians and computer technicians. Ms. Kopp also worked with the Dia Art Foundation, the Dance Notation Bureau, the New York State Historical Documents Inventory and the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Musical Instrument Collection.         In 1995 she received the Mid Atlantic Regional Archives Conference's Arline Custer Memorial Award for her publication ''Dance Archives: A Practical Manual for Documenting and Preserving the Ephemeral Art.''         Ms. Kopp is survived by her companion, Carolynn Jennings, and their daughter, Hanna, both of New York City.       
         Barbara Epstein, a founder and co-editor of The New York Review of Books and a figure at the center of New York literary life for decades, died yesterday in the apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in which she had lived for more than 50 years. She was 77.         The cause was lung cancer, her son, Jacob, said. He added that his mother, whose cancer was diagnosed in September 2005, was in her office as recently as two and a half weeks ago.         For much of her career, Ms. Epstein was famous for being part of a tandem. During the 1950's and 60's, she and her husband at the time, Jason, were the first couple of publishing, powerful book editors who knew everyone and gave the kind of high-octane dinner parties that warranted mention in Edmund Wilson's journals.         With Robert Silvers, her co-editor at The New York Review, she had an office partnership that endured even longer than her marriage, which ended in divorce in 1980.         ''Barbara was one of the most influential editors of our time,'' the writer Janet Malcolm said. ''But she had none of the qualities -- aggressiveness, ruthlessness, egotism -- that are commonly associated with powerful editors. Barbara's uncommon modesty, gentleness and charm were the source of a certain mysteriousness. They were also, of course, entirely of a piece with the magazine she and Bob Silvers put out.''         Ms. Epstein was born Barbara Zimmerman, the younger of two sisters, in Boston in 1928. Her father sold textiles and her mother was a homemaker. She attended Girls Latin School and graduated in 1949 from Radcliffe.         She began her editorial career as an assistant at Doubleday, then quickly rose to prominence there as the editor of Anne Frank's ''Diary of a Young Girl,'' among other books. She went on to work at Dutton, McGraw-Hill and The Partisan Review. In 1954 she married Mr. Epstein. Their children, Jacob, of Los Angeles, and Helen, of Brooklyn, survive her, as do three grandchildren.         It was at the Epsteins' dinner table, during the winter of 1962, that the idea for The New York Review of Books was hatched. New York's daily newspapers were on strike, and the absence of The New York Times Book Review had stranded publishers with no place to advertise their books and authors with no place for their work to be written about. To fill the vacuum, Mr. and Mrs. Epstein, together with Robert Lowell and his wife, Elizabeth Hardwick, who were guests that evening, decided to put out a book review of their own. ''Jason was, like, 'Kids, let's put on a show,' '' Ms. Epstein recalled.         The strike ended in February, but The Review, which had by then come out twice, was so successful that Ms. Epstein and Mr. Silvers, who had been recruited as co-editor, decided to keep it going. It became one of the most influential and admired journals of its kind, attracting a high-powered roster of writers. The books reviewed and those who reviewed them were all carefully hand picked, causing many to view the magazine as a kind of private club.         Ms. Epstein and Mr. Silvers made an unusual literary tag team. He is large and formidable. She was small, friendly and enthusiastic. They informally divided the literary turf between them. Mr. Silvers claimed history, politics, science and art history; Ms. Epstein looked after the arts and more literary books. But philosophically they saw eye to eye.         ''We were such close partners in the way of sharing every commission, every manuscript, every decision,'' Mr. Silvers said yesterday. Ms. Epstein, he said, read every manuscript that made it into The Review.         The poet James Fenton said: ''The system was always that whichever was actually editing you, the other was always checking in. Nothing was done by one without the participation of the other.''         Ms. Epstein was famous for putting articles though multiple revisions if necessary, sending out what were known as the A, B, C and sometimes the D and E proofs. ''She was the fiercest editor,'' the writer Diane Johnson, a close friend, recalled. ''Very much the perfectionist, but in a very sympathetic way.''         And she was arguably the more fun-loving of The New York Review's ruling pair, reliably turning up at book parties, no matter how obscure, except on evenings when she was giving her own. Her companion of many years after her divorce was the columnist Murray Kempton, who died in 1997.         ''She loved Champagne,'' the writer Nora Ephron recalled, ''and she herself had this quality that was so fizzy and festive, with such an appetite for trivia and gossip, that you completely forgot she was the editor of The New York Review.''       
         Reathel Odum, a bank clerk who was chosen by Senator Harry S. Truman during the Depression to be one of his secretaries and later served in the White House as personal secretary to Bess Truman, died in her hometown, Benton, Ill., on June 6. She was 97.         Miss Odum's nephew, Richard Odum Hart, said news of her death was not released for several weeks.         In 17 years with the Trumans -- including two years chaperoning their daughter, Margaret, when she was making national tours as an aspiring classical singer -- Miss Odum became close to the family.         ''People have urged me to write a book and I said no,'' she said in a 1988 oral history for the Truman Presidential Museum and Library in Independence, Mo. ''I don't know anything that would be tantalizing or gossipy.''         If it does not offer significant historical observations, Miss Odum's oral history does provide interesting glimpses of Truman and his family, for example, how much he missed Mrs. Truman when she went home to Independence in the summer.         ''He'd put his head in the office door and say, 'Is there any mail from the Boss? If there isn't, I'm going to fire every one of you,' '' Miss Odum recalled. ''That was a standing joke.''         While Truman had a reputation for spicy language, Miss Odum said: ''He never did swear in front of us girls. He put women on a pedestal.''         Asked about Mrs. Truman's role as first lady, Miss Odum said, ''After meeting so many people and shaking their hands at receptions, she would go to her room and soak her hand in paraffin.''         Born on Sept. 29, 1908, Miss Odum was the youngest of five children. Her father died when she was 4, and her mother raised the family. Miss Odum, who never married, has no immediate survivors.         She graduated from Benton Township High School in 1926 and soon got a job at a local bank. One day 10 years later, Truman walked into a bank in St. Louis where Miss Odum was working and told its president, a friend, that he needed a secretary. The bank president recommended Miss Odum. ''I was scared to death,'' she recalled. ''I had never talked to a senator before.''         Miss Odum arrived at Truman's Senate office in Washington in October 1936 and worked there until 1945. She and Mrs. Truman volunteered together at the local U.S.O. during World War II. ''We peeled carrots and did whatever to help entertain soldiers away from home,'' Miss Odum said. Often, they took bike rides around the Tidal Basin.         Truman became vice president in 1945; less than three months later, President Franklin D. Roosevelt was dead. On his first full day as president, Truman asked Miss Odum to be Mrs. Truman's personal secretary.         Unlike Eleanor Roosevelt, Mrs. Truman did not like to speak to reporters. Sometimes a ''press girl'' would call and ask what Mrs. Truman would be wearing to a reception, Miss Odum said, and the first lady would say, ''It's none of their business.''         In 1947, Miss Odum began accompanying Margaret Truman on her concert tours. Asked how Miss Truman reacted to music critics, Miss Odum said: ''She tried not to read the reviews. She had determination to go ahead despite the critics.''         After her White House service, which ended when Truman left office in 1953, Miss Odum worked as a secretary for Senator Stuart Symington of Missouri, for a coal industry lobbying group and then for the Truman Scholarship Foundation.         Whenever the Trumans returned to Washington, she said, ''I'd go over to the Mayflower and say hello.''         Correction:  August 9, 2006, Wednesday  A picture on July 24 with an obituary of Reathel Odum, secretary to Bess Truman when she was first lady, was published in error. The photograph, released by The Associated Press in 1945 and identified as Miss Odum, was actually Jane Lingo (a friend of President Truman's daughter, Margaret).       
         Annely Juda, a London art dealer whose gallery, Annely Juda Fine Art, was known for its pioneering shows of early European modernists, died on Aug. 13 in London. She was 91.         Ms. Juda died after nearly a year of declining health, said Michael Michaeledes, an artist and friend of the family, who has exhibited with Ms. Juda's gallery since 1963.         In a gallery career that spanned five decades, Ms. Juda represented numerous contemporary artists, among them Anthony Caro, David Hockney, Leon Kossoff, Alan Charlton, Christo and Jeanne-Claude, and Tadashi Kawamata. But she was especially known for her annual summer exhibitions, often titled ''The Non-Objective World,'' which helped reintroduce the work of the Russian avant-garde and of de Stijl and Bauhaus artists to the London art world and beyond; they often contained works rarely seen elsewhere. The 1981 summer show, for example, featured seven sculptures by the Russian Constructivist Vladimir Tatlin reconstructed from archival photographs by Martyn Chalk, a British sculptor.         Ms. Juda was born Anneliese Brauer in Kassel, Germany, in 1914. Her mother was a designer of clothing and typefaces, and her father was an industrial chemist with a keen interest in Goethe's theory of color. Ms. Juda began studying art history, but the family, which was Jewish, moved to Palestine shortly after Hitler came to power.         Three years later, she traveled to London, working in a boarding house for German refugees in lieu of paying rent while she studied art history and clothing design at the Reimann School. In 1939, she married Paul Juda, also German, and in 1949 she returned with her husband to Germany to try to reclaim his family's confiscated property.         In 1955, the couple separated and Ms. Juda took their three children to London, where she raised them alone, often by working several jobs at once. For two years she administered the Eric Estorick Collection, which immersed her in the art of the Italian Futurists.         In 1960 Ms. Juda opened the Molton Gallery with partners; it was followed in 1963 by the Hamilton Galleries, also with partners. In 1968, she joined forces with her son, David, to form Annely Juda Fine Art, inaugurating the gallery with her first summer exhibition of non-objective art. Ms. Juda was made a Companion of the Order of the British Empire in 1998.         In addition to her son, she is survived by two daughters, Carol Spund of Glasgow and Susan Habrovitsky of Fontenay-sous-Bois, France; four grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.       
         Andrée Ruellan, a noted painter of the 1930's and 40's whose complete body of work spans almost the entire 20th century, died on July 15 in Kingston, N.Y. She was 101 and lived for many years in Shady, N.Y., near Woodstock.         Her death was confirmed by a friend, Daniel Gelfand. Ms. Ruellan leaves no immediate survivors.         A child prodigy, Ms. Ruellan first exhibited her work at 9. As a young woman, she was known for her sympathetic depictions of scenes from ordinary life, which she observed on the streets of New York and in her travels in the American South.         Reviewing an exhibition of Ms. Ruellan's work in 1940, The New York Times called it ''light, fresh and largely in the true field of American genre,'' adding, ''it is never without strength and clarity.''         Last year, in honor of Ms. Ruellan's 100th birthday, a retrospective of her work was organized by the Georgia Museum of Art in Athens, Ga. It is currently on view, through Aug. 27, at the Columbus Museum in Columbus, Ga.         Ms. Ruellan's work is in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art and elsewhere.         Andrée Ruellan (pronounced roo-ELL-en) was born in Manhattan on April 6, 1905, to parents who had come from France. Her father, André, was an aviator and airplane mechanic.         Ms. Ruellan began drawing early. In 1914, when she was 9, the Ashcan School painter Robert Henri invited her to join a group show in the East Village; she contributed watercolors and drawings of urban street life. That year she also had an illustration published in The Masses, a progressive magazine.         In 1920 Ms. Ruellan's father was killed in an airfield accident, and she began selling her work to support herself and her mother, Lucette. The same year she was awarded a scholarship to the Art Students League of New York, where she studied with the noted painter Maurice Sterne.         For much of the 1920's, she and her mother lived in Paris. There she met John W. Taylor, a painter, whom she married in 1929. Soon afterward, the couple moved to Shady, where they were for decades part of Woodstock's lively artists' colony. Mr. Taylor died in 1983.         During the Depression Ms. Ruellan and her husband made several trips to the South, which resulted in some of her most memorable work. Her paintings from the period are notable for their portrayals of ordinary African-Americans at work and at play.         ''Crap Game'' (1936), perhaps Ms. Ruellan's best-known painting, depicts a group of black men in Charleston, S.C., engaged in an avid game of dice. But the muted palette and the stark emptiness of the background convey the straitened circumstances of black life in the Depression-era South.         In later years Ms. Ruellan's work was more influenced by Surrealism and Abstract Expressionism. But to the end of her career -- she continued to draw until she was well into her 80's -- she remained a Realist, committed to the idea that art should represent solid, flesh-and-blood humanity.         ''People are never just spots of color,'' Ms. Ruellan told American Artist magazine in 1943. ''What moves me most is that in spite of poverty and the constant struggle for existence, so much kindness and sturdy courage remain. Naturally I want to paint well-designed pictures -- but I also wish to convey these warmer human emotions.''       
         Gay Delanghe, a modern-dance choreographer and performer whose work was staged in New York in the 1960's and 70's and who became an influential teacher, died on Aug. 1 in Ann Arbor, Mich. She was 65.         The cause was ovarian cancer, according to Peter Sparling, a friend and colleague.         Ms. Delanghe was known for her authoritative, witty dancing in performances of her own work and with choreographers including Lucas Hoving and Yvonne Rainer. A lead dancer in Hoving's troupe, she staged his pieces for companies and college dance departments for 20 years. Her dances, presented in the 1960's and 70's at New York theaters including the Cubiculo and Dance Theater Workshop, had something of the same quality.         ''There is a slightly loony streak running through Gay Delanghe's choreography that gives it special distinction,'' Don McDonagh wrote in The New York Times in 1973. ''She manages to be earnest and flighty, humorous and dead serious, strict and permissive by unexpected turns.''         Born in Detroit, Ms. Delanghe trained in dance at the University of Michigan before moving on to New York City and a dance career that included teaching at Barnard College and the American Dance Festival. She returned to the University of Michigan in 1974 as a faculty member in the newly formed dance department and became a central figure in the development of modern dance in Michigan over four decades.         Ms. Delanghe is survived by her mother, Lenore Delanghe of Clinton Township, Mich.       
         Buffie Johnson, a painter whose work spanned much of the 20th century and ranged from Surrealism to Abstract Expressionism to larger-than-life hyperrealism, died on Aug. 11 at her home in Manhattan. She was 94.         The cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease, said Joan Schenkar, a friend.         Ms. Johnson, who began showing her paintings in the 1930's, continued to exhibit until the end of her life. In 2002, in honor of her 90th birthday, she was the subject of a one-woman show at the Anita Shapolsky Gallery in New York. Last year, the gallery featured her work as part of its group exhibition ''Betty Parsons and the Women.''         A woman of independent means, Ms. Johnson was by all accounts a woman of sociable temperament, and her life was intertwined with those of some of the 20th century's leading artists, writers and performers. Over the years, she befriended, socialized with or otherwise brushed up against a cast of luminaries including Paul and Jane Bowles, Truman Capote, Willem de Kooning, Lawrence Durrell, Greta Garbo, Patricia Highsmith, Gene Krupa, Gypsy Rose Lee, Robert Motherwell, Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner, Mark Rothko, Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas, Gore Vidal and Andy Warhol.         In her work, Ms. Johnson was concerned with the intersection of spiritualism, myth and symbol. Deeply influenced by the psychiatrist Carl Jung, whom she also befriended, she wrote ''Lady of the Beasts: Ancient Images of the Goddess and Her Sacred Animals,'' published by Harper & Row in 1988.         Buffie Johnson was born in New York City on Feb. 20, 1912. After studying at the University of California, Los Angeles, she embarked for Europe, where she trained with the noted painters Francis Picabia and Stanley William Hayter. In 1943, she was included in an exhibition at Peggy Guggenheim's New York gallery, Art of This Century, which featured the work of 31 women.         After an early marriage that ended in divorce, Ms. Johnson married the writer and critic Gerald Sykes, from whom she was later divorced. Their daughter, Jenny Johnson Sykes, of Nyack, N.Y., is her only immediate survivor.         Ms. Johnson's earliest works tended toward the Surrealist; then came more abstract canvases of intense color and pure form. In later years, she turned to huge realistic paintings of flowers and other plant forms, which were imbued with texture through their profuse, veiny detail.         In the late 1950's, Ms. Johnson was commissioned to paint a huge abstract mural for the Astor Theater on Broadway at 45th Street. Comprising more than 200 45-foot-high panels, the mural, in deep blues, evoked the city at night. The panels were returned to her when the theater was demolished in 1982.         Her work is in the collections of major museums, including the Guggenheim, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Brooklyn Museum and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.         Ms. Johnson sometimes figured in the work of her celebrated friends -- she was photographed by Edward Weston, André Kertesz and Karl Bissinger -- and they sometimes figured in hers. One of her best-known paintings from the 1940's is a portrait of Tennessee Williams.         It was an association Ms. Johnson came to regret after she let Williams stay in her house. He used the good china when he wasn't supposed to.         Correction:  September 11, 2006, Monday  An obituary on Sept. 2 about the artist Buffie Johnson misstated the dimensions of the panels that made up the mural she painted for the Astor Theater in New York in the late 1950's. Although the finished mural was 45 feet high, each of its 224 panels measured roughly 5 feet by 10 feet; the panels themselves were not 45 feet high.       
         Iris M. Ovshinsky, who along with her husband, the iconoclastic inventor Stanford R. Ovshinsky, produced cleaner automotive technologies and pushed the auto industry to embrace them, died on Aug. 16 near her home in Bloomfield Township, Mich. She was 79.         She drowned after apparently suffering a heart attack while swimming, the township police said.         In 1960, the Ovshinskys founded ECD Ovonics, an alternative energy company based in Rochester Hills, outside Detroit. There, among other inventions, Mr. Ovshinsky created the rechargeable nickel-metal hydride battery, often called the NiMH, which the company has produced since the 1980's and which helped lay the groundwork for today's hybrid gasoline-and-electric vehicles.         In the forward to a new book about Mr. Ovshinsky, the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, former president of Notre Dame University, writes: ''Anyone who knows ECD knows that it is as much Iris's creation as it is Stan's.'' At her death, Mrs. Ovshinsky was vice president and a director of the company, formally listed as Energy Conversion Devices.         The couple worked closely with automakers in Detroit, but their passion for renewable and alternative sources of energy often put them at odds with the industry.         ''You might say they were on different sides of the argument,'' said Robert C. Stempel, the former chairman of General Motors who is now chief executive of ECD Ovonics. ''They were some of the early thinkers on what could we do to not waste things. Sometimes you're challenging the conventional wisdom.''         Mr. and Mrs. Ovshinsky figured prominently in the film ''Who Killed the Electric Car?,'' a documentary released in June about how automakers had pursued electric car technology but later abandoned it.         Friends said she was both a voice and a sounding board for Stanford Ovshinsky's inventions. ''She was the ears of her husband,'' said Hellmut Fritzsche, a friend and scientific collaborator. ''So everybody knew that they could approach her and thereby reach him.''         That work also helped produce the EV1, General Motors' aborted foray into the electric car market in the 1990's. The vehicle represented a technology and a cause ahead of its time, and it added to the Ovshinskys' esteem among scientists who study alternative energy.         ''A lot of the work from the E.V. spawned a lot of the work that became the intellectual property for batteries associated with hybrid vehicles,'' said David Hermance, Toyota's executive engineer for advanced technology vehicles. ''Their work was what made E.V.'s practical, to the extent that they were practical.''         Mr. Ovshinsky's NiMH battery was not the ideal power source for a vehicle, though it gained common use in products like cellphones and digital cameras. It was largely replaced by the lithium-ion battery, which does not need to be discharged fully before being recharged.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Ovshinsky is survived by a daughter, Robin Dibner, and a son, Steven Dibner, from a previous marriage; three stepsons, Ben, Harvey and Dale Ovshinsky; and four grandchildren.         Mr. and Mrs. Ovshinsky were perhaps known as much for their five-decade partnership as for their contributions to alternative energy.         In an interview with PBS in 2004, Mr. Ovshinsky was asked how the two managed to work so well together. ''By being in love,'' he replied.         Mrs. Ovshinsky added, ''We're very, very lucky.''       
         Margaret Phipps Boegner, who opened her family's vast Long Island estate, Old Westbury Gardens, to the public, died on Saturday at her home in Old Westbury, N.Y. She was 99.         Her death was announced by the gardens, of which she was founder and former chairwoman.         Mrs. Boegner was the granddaughter of Henry Phipps, who in 1861 joined his friend Andrew Carnegie in the steel venture that became a core part of the United States Steel Corporation at its founding in 1901. Mrs. Boegner was the daughter of John S. Phipps and of Margarita Grace Phipps, whose family started the Grace Shipping Line.         In 1905, John and Margarita Phipps built an English Restoration-style manor house on 160 acres along Old Westbury Road in central Nassau County. The area, which had been the site of Quaker farms, was by then dotted by imposing country estates. Seventy acres of the Phipps estate were set aside for precisely sculptured and varied gardens.         Mrs. Boegner's mother died in 1957, and her father died in 1958. A year later, Mrs. Boegner -- who by then lived in a somewhat more modest white clapboard home adjacent to the estate -- established and became chairwoman of the nonprofit Old Westbury Gardens. Since then, the public has been allowed to roam the gardens and take tours of the manor house, which is furnished with 18th-century antiques.         Circular rose gardens, a rainbow of blossoms surrounding a thatched cottage and an Italianate walled garden with trees trained to grow in the shape of candelabras are found near the main house. There are grand vistas down rows of linden and beech trees. And the far reaches of the estate, with lakes and ponds, evoke 18th-century English landscapes.         Margaret Helen Phipps Boegner, who preferred to be called Peggie, was born on Nov. 17, 1906. A year later, the family moved to Old Westbury. Mrs. Boegner lived in the main house until 1930, when she married J. Gordon Douglas Jr. The marriage ended in divorce in 1947. In 1951, she married Etienne Boegner, a French diplomat. Mr. Boegner died in 1985.         Mrs. Boegner is survived by a daughter, Dita Douglas Naylor-Leyland of Manhattan; a son, J. Gordon Douglas III of Pawling, N.Y.; three grandchildren; and a great-granddaughter.       
         Patricia Kennedy Lawford, who as a sister of President John F. Kennedy had a front row seat to history and forged new links between her brother's administration and Hollywood through her marriage to the actor Peter Lawford, died Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 82 and also had a home in Southampton, N.Y.         The cause was complications of pneumonia, said Melissa Wagoner, a spokeswoman for Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, Mrs. Lawford's brother.         Athletic, lithe and as poised as a princess, Mrs. Lawford is widely remembered as the Roman Catholic schoolgirl who dismayed her domineering father, Joseph P. Kennedy, the former ambassador to Britain, by marrying Mr. Lawford, a debonair British actor.         The marriage, in 1954, was the stuff of newsreels: some 3,000 spectators gathered outside St. Thomas More Roman Catholic Church on the Upper East Side.         The sixth of nine children born to Joseph Kennedy and Rose Elizabeth Fitzgerald Kennedy, Mrs. Lawford, like her siblings, had a well-honed understanding of politics and of the power of appearances. As early as 1946, she campaigned for her brother John during his first run for Congress, organizing highly effective women's coffees in Boston and Cambridge neighborhoods. When he ran for president in 1960, she often substituted at events for his wife, Jacqueline Kennedy, who was pregnant.         The Lawfords strengthened John Kennedy's ties to the show business world of Hollywood and Las Vegas through Mr. Lawford's association with the ''Rat Pack'' of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Joey Bishop and Shirley MacLaine.         Mr. Sinatra threw his support behind Kennedy, and his hit song ''High Hopes,'' with lyrics by Sammy Cahn, became the Kennedy campaign song. At the opening of the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, Sinatra, Davis, Mr. Lawford and Ms. MacLaine helped lead the singing of ''The Star-Spangled Banner.''         Through the years, Mrs. Lawford was a close friend of Marilyn Monroe, Tennessee Williams and Sinatra, for whom she partly named her daughter Victoria Frances.         In 1966, after 11 years of marriage, Mrs. Lawford became the first Kennedy to file for a divorce. It was a highly publicized break, one that required Mrs. Lawford to establish residency in Idaho to circumvent New York's divorce laws of the time.         Afterward, Mrs. Lawford and her four children moved to New York, where she took on a busy social schedule, befriended artists and writers and became known as a generous benefactor of the arts. She was a familiar presence at benefit dinners, and her patronage would increase the cachet of any fund-raising event. Her name appeared regularly in the society columns of New York, the Hamptons and Palm Beach, Fla.         Patricia Kennedy was born on May 6, 1924, in Brookline, Mass., the fourth daughter of Joseph and Rose Kennedy and the granddaughter of John F. Fitzgerald, the popular mayor of Boston who had earlier served in the House of Representatives.         In the 1930's, while her father was ambassador to Britain, she attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart at Roehampton, a boarding school for girls on the outskirts of London. When her family moved to Bronxville, N.Y., she attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart school in the Maplehurst section of the Bronx. (It later moved to Greenwich, Conn.) She attended Rosemont College in Pennsylvania, graduating in 1945.         Hers was a family that expected women to be graceful and well rounded while remaining in the background, quietly serving the ambitions of their men. Of the five Kennedy sisters, she was considered the most beautiful and sophisticated, with the aristocratic air of her mother. She was an accomplished athlete, but she never caught the family's legendary fire for competition.         In her 1987 book, ''The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys,'' Doris Kearns Goodwin wrote that Rose Kennedy was bothered by Patricia's lack of ambition. ''Although she had a good mind, a fine physique and a beautiful face which could easily have led her to excel in school,'' Ms. Goodwin wrote, ''in sports or in appearance, Rose contended 'she would never make the effort to achieve distinction' in any of these areas.''         But Mrs. Lawford's son, Christopher Lawford, wrote in his best-selling memoir, ''Symptoms of Withdrawal,'' published last year, that his mother had been resentful of her father for ''not being allowed fully to live up to her potential.''         In college she directed and acted in theater productions, and she pursued those interests after graduation, going to work as an assistant in the New York production department of NBC. She moved to Los Angeles to work as an assistant for Kate Smith's radio show and later for ''Family Theater,'' the radio program produced by the Rev. Patrick Peyton.         Much like her older sister Kathleen, who made her mother furious by marrying outside her church, Patricia disappointed her parents by marrying Mr. Lawford, a nominal Episcopalian who agreed to rear their children as Catholics.         Mrs. Lawford was the only Kennedy to move away from the family's traditional East Coast settings of Hyannis Port, Palm Beach and New York. She and Mr. Lawford settled into a sprawling oceanfront home in California once owned by Louis B. Mayer. The house became a recreation center for other family members; the president spent time lounging at his sister's pool when he was on the West Coast.         After the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963, Mrs. Lawford was often seen in the company of his widow and their two children, Caroline and John Jr. In 1986, she joined Senator Kennedy on an official visit to Chile that was marred by egg-throwing protesters angered by Mr. Kennedy's criticism of President Augusto Pinochet.         Mrs. Lawford devoted her energies to organizations that served the mentally disabled and to those helping people with substance abuse problems. She had a close personal appreciation for both causes: her older sister Rosemary, who died last year, was born mildly retarded and was lobotomized at 23; and she, Mr. Lawford and her son had waged their own battles with drugs and alcohol.         Mrs. Lawford's brother Robert, the former attorney general and later senator from New York, was closest to her in age, just 18 months younger. After his assassination in 1968, Mrs. Lawford assembled a privately printed book of reminiscences about him, as John had done for their oldest brother, Joe, who died in World War II.         The book, ''That Shining Hour,'' was published in 1969. Mrs. Lawford wrote in her introduction: ''This is not a sad book. Bobby was not a sad person. His basic shyness to the outside world gave way to fun, humor and wit whenever he was with the family.''         In addition to her brother Edward, Mrs. Lawford is survived by her son, Christopher, of California; three daughters, Sydney and Victoria Frances, both of Washington, and Robin, of New York; her sisters Jean Kennedy Smith and Eunice Kennedy Shriver; and 10 grandchildren.         In her last years, Mrs. Lawford led a relatively private life. She may have been a Kennedy, a woman with an instantly familiar name, but she did not crave attention and enjoyed walking the streets of Manhattan without being recognized.         Reprinted from yesterday's late editions.         Correction:  September 19, 2006, Tuesday  An obituary in some copies yesterday about Patricia Kennedy Lawford, a sister of President John F. Kennedy, misstated the location of her death. It was at her home in Manhattan, not her home in Southampton, N.Y. The article also erroneously included a survivor; her sister Rosemary Kennedy died last year. The obituary also misstated the place of residence of Mrs. Lawford's son, Christopher. He lives in California, not New York. A full obituary appears today on page B8.       
         Hélène Deschamps Adams, who as a teenager in France defied death by spying for groups resisting Nazi occupiers and their collaborators, and later for the United States, died on Sept. 16 in Manhattan. She was 85.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said her daughter, Karyn Anick Monget, who noted that her mother had a variety of maladies, including pneumonia.         Hélène Deschamps came from a military family, was a tomboy and hated the thought of the Nazis' taking over her country. This combination propelled her to volunteer to fight with the French Resistance. Her youthful looks, insouciance and an accent German soldiers found delightful helped provide cover.         She reported on airfield locations, German mines and antiaircraft and camouflaged emplacements along the shores of the Mediterranean. She saved American parachutists from capture at drop zones and helped Jewish families escape to Spain.         ''Hélène was a very gutsy young woman,'' Henry Hyde, the chief of American intelligence in France during World War II, said in an interview in ''Women in the Resistance'' by Margaret L. Rossiter (Praeger, 1985). ''She went through the lines for us, observing German defense installations and order of battle,'' he said. ''She took many risks and was a genuinely good operator.''         She was captured by resistance fighters from another resistance group while carrying fake German papers and was almost executed. A close friend she regarded as a sister, whom she had recruited to spy with her, was killed by a sniper while she was in the back seat of a car driven by Ms. Deschamps, who then quickly had to dig the grave.         She hid in a closet full of apples while drunken Germans tormented her French protectors. She watched in silent terror as Nazi soldiers brutalized a pregnant woman at a roadside.         In an interview with CNN in 1996, Mrs. Deschamps Adams said her years of espionage had ''no glamour, no romance, no dinner at the embassy in a designer gown.''         There was only a necessary job, she said. ''You have to forget your own feelings.''         Gratitude was never plentiful. Mrs. Deschamps Adams's daughter said her mother never got the pension that she said had been promised by someone in the Office of Strategic Services, the wartime spy agency that was the C.I.A.'s precursor. She got no awards from governments until 2000, when the United States gave her the Distinguished Service Medal and France recognized her heroism in a joint ceremony.         She did find love on the battlefield. After a whirlwind weekend with an American first lieutenant, Forest E. Adams, whom she met while he was on furlough, she accepted his marriage proposal and came to the United States with him in 1946. Their daughter said neither knew much of the other's language, but shared what her mother called ''the language of love.''         Mr. Adams died of a heart attack in 1951, and Mrs. Deschamps Adams never remarried. Karyn, a baby at the time of her father's death, said her mother told her she never met a man as good as the one she lost.         In addition to her daughter, who lives in Manhattan, Mrs. Deschamps Adams is survived by a brother, Henri Deschamps of Maraussan, France.         Hélène Marguerite Deschamps was born on Jan. 30, 1921, in the French concession of what was then called Tientsin, China, and was raised in Senegal, Madagascar and Réunion, an island department of France in the Indian Ocean. Her father, a general in the French colonial army, retired to Aix-en-Provence, in the south of France, in the late 1930's.         She was studying in a convent when Hitler invaded France in 1940. The advice of her mentor, a French colonel who had been a friend of her father's, was to ''join the Red Cross or something,'' not the underground.         She had no special training when she and the friend she recruited began riding their bicycles to spy on German troops -- some of whom gallantly helped with bike repairs.         She was given the code name Anick and posed as a secretary at the headquarters of the Milice, the special police force known as the French Gestapo. She stole the records of people marked for execution, including Jews and resistance fighters, and stuffed them in her brassiere, her daughter said, then flushed them down the toilet.         She suffered a permanent back injury when she was beaten by a French interrogator, and was partly deaf because she walked into a building where she knew a bomb had been planted, and it went off just as she was leaving.         When she became disillusioned with the resistance because so many anti-Nazi groups were competing against one another, a resistance leader arranged for her to meet an O.S.S. agent, who accepted her on the strength of the leader's word.         After her husband's death, Mrs. Deschamps Adams worked on a Lockheed assembly line and then taught French in many places, including Iran, Hawaii, Germany and Bermuda. She wrote two memoirs, ''The Secret War'' (W. H. Allen, 1980) and ''Spyglass: An Autobiography'' (Henry Holt, 1995).         In the introduction to ''Spyglass,'' she asked a question: ''If you had to renounce family, friends, any kind of a normal lifestyle to fight a fierce enemy, would you?''       
         Astrid Varnay, the charismatic dramatic soprano whose distinguished 55-year career began at 23 with a last-minute debut at the Metropolitan Opera, singing the role of Sieglinde in Wagner's ''Walküre'' for an indisposed Lotte Lehmann, died in Munich on Monday. She was 88.         The cause was a pericardial infection after a long illness, said the writer Donald Arthur, who collaborated with Ms. Varnay on her autobiography, ''Fifty-Five Years in Five Acts: My Life in Opera'' (2000, Northeastern University Press).         As a Wagnerian soprano, Ms. Varnay never achieved the widespread public recognition of her beloved mentor Kirsten Flagstad or her good friend Birgit Nilsson, who like Ms. Varnay was born in Sweden in 1918. But to opera buffs and insiders, Ms. Varnay was a comparably excellent artist.         Her voice had a remarkable range of colorings, from steely luster in climactic outbursts to dusky mellowness in lyrical phrases. She was an alluring woman and a natural actress who conveyed both tragic dignity and impetuosity. Text and music were one in Ms. Varnay's subtle interpretations.         Her work recently came to public attention again when the Testament label released the first two installments of a complete account of Wagner's ''Ring,'' recorded live at the 1955 Bayreuth Festival in Germany. Ms. Varnay, portraying Brünnhilde in ''Die Walküre'' and ''Siegfried,'' sings with shimmering intensity and keen dramatic insight.         In a phone interview yesterday, James Levine called Ms. Varnay ''one of the truly unique singers'' and recalled working with her in 1979 when, at 61, she sang the role of the hard-bitten Widow Begbick in John Dexter's gritty production of the Weill-Brecht opera ''The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny.''         ''I can't think of anyone else who had a grip on the whole thing the way she did,'' Mr. Levine said. ''She sang from the inside out.'' He added: ''The whole score, everything was in her realization, and the presence and the drama were always in balance with the music.''         Though opera was the family business, Ms. Varnay was a latecomer to singing. Ibolyka Astrid Maria Varnay was born in Stockholm on April 25, 1918, to Hungarian parents. At the time, her mother, Maria Javor, a noted coloratura soprano, and her father, Alexander Varnay, a tenor who became a stage director and producer, were working at the Royal Swedish Opera in Stockholm.         In a story she loved to tell in later life, Ms. Varnay said her mother used the bottom drawer of a dressing table backstage as a makeshift crib for her infant daughter during a performance of Verdi's ''Ballo in Maschera.'' The table belonged to the company's prima donna, Flagstad, who watched over the baby.         When Astrid was 4, the Varnay family, in search of opportunities, moved to Buenos Aires and then to New York. Her father, who was working as a director at the Manhattan Opera House, died suddenly in 1924. Her mother married an Italian tenor, and the family settled in Jersey City, where Ms. Varnay was brought up.         She set her sights on becoming a pianist. But her vocal talent was overwhelming and she began serious training at 20, working privately with Hermann Weigert, a coach and assistant conductor at the Met. When she sang an audition for Edward Johnson, then the general manager of the Met, he could not believe that Ms. Varnay, a 22-year-old, had learned 13 daunting soprano roles.         When he needed a Sieglinde at the last minute for a Saturday matinee broadcast performance of ''Die Walküre'' on Dec. 6, 1941, he turned to Ms. Varnay, who had not even had a stage rehearsal. Cultural news that weekend was pushed aside by the events of the following day: the attack on Pearl Harbor. Still, the opera world took notice.         The New York Times review reported that the ''exceedingly comely Swedish-American soprano acted with a skill and grace only possible to those with an inborn talent for the theater.''         Six days later, Helen Traubel, scheduled to sing Brünnhilde in ''Die Walküre,'' took ill and Ms. Varnay, in another last-minute substitution, sang the role, wowing New York audiences and critics.         In 1944 she married her coach, Mr. Weigert, who died in 1955. (Ms. Varnay has no immediate survivors.) Though in the late 1940's she branched into the Italian repertory, at the Met she was known for her Wagner interpretations. She sang around 200 performances with the company.         Still, disagreements with Rudolf Bing, who became the Met's general manager in 1950, led her to concentrate her career in Europe. She became a mainstay of companies in Berlin, Munich and Vienna. She was a particular favorite of Wieland Wagner, Richard Wagner's grandson, who ran the Bayreuth Festival and directed Ms. Varnay in several of his radically abstract and spare productions.         In the late 1960's she gave up her weighty dramatic soprano repertory, which included a chilling portrayal of Strauss's Elektra, and began a ''second career,'' as she called it, singing mezzo-soprano roles and character parts. Mr. Levine said when he asked Ms. Varnay late in her career why she still undertook small roles like Mamma Lucia in Mascagni's ''Cavalleria Rusticana,'' she told him, '' 'I just love being on stage, seeing up close the work of my younger colleagues.' ''       
         Patty Berg, the winner of a record 15 women's major golf championships and a founder of the Ladies Professional Golf Association, died yesterday in Fort Myers, Fla. She was 88.         Her death was announced by the L.P.G.A. She had Alzheimer's disease.         Berg won the first United States Women's Open, in 1946, and she won the Titleholders Championship and the Western Open seven times each when they were major tournaments. She was the first president of the L.P.G.A. when it formally began in 1950.         Berg won 60 professional and 28 amateur tournaments. In the 1950's, she was the leading money winner on the L.P.G.A. Tour three times and the winner of the Vare Trophy for the lowest average score during the Tour season three times. She was inducted into the L.P.G.A. Tour and World Golf halls of fame and was voted The Associated Press female athlete of the year in 1938, 1943 and 1955.         Berg promoted women's golf at thousands of clinics, her technical skills complemented by an ebullient personality.         At times, however, she was overshadowed by Babe Didrikson Zaharias, her friend and rival. ''Patty got kicked under the rug because of Babe,'' Mickey Wright, who is second on the career list with 13 major victories, once said.         But Wright considered Berg the finest female golfer she ever saw.         ''No. 1, she had a good grip,'' Wright told Rhonda Glenn in ''The Illustrated History of Women's Golf.''         ''She had a simple golf swing that never changed. She had the club square. She hit the ball solidly, she hit the ball high. She knew more golf shots than any other women before or after.''         Patricia Jane Berg was born Feb. 13, 1918, in Minneapolis. Her father, Herman Berg, owned a grain company and played golf at Interlachen Country Club in suburban Edina. Her brother, Herman Jr., was a fine golfer.         She hardly had a classic athlete's frame: she was 5 feet 2 inches tall, but was a natural at sports.         As a youngster, she played quarterback for a boys' neighborhood football team called the 50th Street Tigers. The team had a lineman named Bud Wilkinson, who became a legendary football coach at Oklahoma. Berg was also an outstanding speedskater for the Minneapolis Powderhorn Club.         Leaving those sports behind, she began taking golf lessons and at age 16 won the Minneapolis city golf championship. At 18, she was a member of the United States Curtis Cup team, a red-haired youngster with a face full of freckles, as she was invariably described in the press.         ''I had tried speedskating and a lot of other sports,'' Berg told The Star-Tribune of Minneapolis in 1988. ''But golf was the great challenge for me. So much to do with tempo, rhythm, balance. I learned so much about patience. That's the key, patience. Then concentration and confidence.''         In 1938, Berg won 10 of 13 amateur tournaments, including the United States Women's Amateur, and was named to the Curtis Cup team for the second time.         In 1940, while a student at the University of Minnesota, she turned pro, promoting Wilson Sporting Goods, her longtime sponsor, at clinics and exhibitions. At the time, there were only a few tournaments for pros, and prize money amounted to a couple of hundred dollars a year.         Berg's career almost ended Dec. 8, 1941, when she sustained a broken knee in an auto accident. She was sidelined for 18 months, then won a couple of tournaments before becoming a Marine officer in World War II, working stateside in recruitment and public relations posts.         Berg won the inaugural United States Women's Open in 1946 in Spokane, Wash., defeating Betty Jameson in match play.         In January 1949, the seeds of the L.P.G.A. were planted when Berg met at the Venetian Hotel in Miami with Zaharias; Zaharias's husband, George; and Fred Corcoran, the P.G.A.'s longtime tournament director and a gifted promoter, to discuss creation of a women's tour. Later that year, Berg was elected president of the fledgling L.P.G.A., and in 1950 the organization officially began with Berg and 12 other golfers recognized as the founders.         In 1950, the women's tour was made up of 14 events with a total of $50,000 in prize money. When Berg became the top money winner for the first time, in 1954, she earned $16,011.         The L.P.G.A. established the Patty Berg Award in 1978 for outstanding contributions to golf. She retired from the Tour two years after that, when she underwent a hip replacement.         In 1996, Berg attended the United States Women's Open at Southern Pines, N.C. The winner, Annika Sorenstam, earned $212,500.         ''Can you believe these galleries?'' Berg said. ''Who could ever have dreamed of all this? When I first played, there were five of us playing for a total purse of $500. The rest were amateurs.''       
         Michelle Urry, who brought a wicked sense of humor, an uncanny ability to nurture eccentric artists and what she called an ''inordinately dirty mind'' to her position as cartoons editor of Playboy magazine, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 66.         The cause was an ocular melanoma, a cancer of the eye, said her daughter-in-law, Justine Rosenthal.         For a generation -- from the early 1970's until her death -- Ms. Urry sorted through more than 1,000 cartoons a week to come up with the couple of dozen or so to appear in the monthly magazine, then sent them on to Hugh Hefner for the final selection. Her taste -- seasoned by a girlhood of reading comic books, the careful study of the history of cartoons and experience as a fashion designer -- helped shape the famous look of Playboy's cartoons.         Brian Walker, curator of a 1984 exhibition of Playboy cartoons at the Museum of Cartoon Art in Rye Brook, N.Y., wrote that ''perhaps with the exception of The New Yorker, Playboy has been the only publication to maintain excellence in the field.''         Playboy's cartoons were certainly sexier than The New Yorker's, but they also reflected a cheekier, more anti-establishment sensibility that Mr. Hefner has said presaged and reflected the sexual revolution of the 1960's and 70's. Ms. Urry assembled a worldwide stable of artists who captured this worldview.         In an interview yesterday, Mr. Hefner said that occasionally Ms. Urry would persuade him to use a cartoon he had initially rejected. He also praised her ability to communicate with cartoonists, whose artistic egos often needed massaging.         The cartoonist Jules Feiffer, in another interview yesterday, said Ms. Urry was a ''mother superior to cartoonists.''         Lee Lorenz, the longtime cartoon editor of The New Yorker, recalled the famous poker parties for cartoonists she held in her loft and the cartoonists' Christmas parties at Playboy headquarters. He praised her ability to choose work that reflected Playboy's mission.         Michelle Dorothy Kaplan was born on Dec. 28, 1939, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, where her father was a clothing manufacturer. She said in an interview with The New York Times in 1995 that instead of dolls she had a huge comic-book collection. After graduating from the University of California at Los Angeles, where she studied English, she opened a dress shop where she sold her own designs.         She sold the shop and moved to New York, but hated it and moved to Chicago, where a friend suggested she might find design work at Playboy.         Instead, she was offered a secretarial job, which she angrily rejected. A few days later, she was offered a job she remembered as ''an assistant something,'' with the promise that in six months she could be an editor. The job was ''bunny department assistant,'' although she was never a bunny, Ms. Rosenthal said.         Not satisfied, she transferred to answering phones at the Playboy mansion, and eventually Mr. Hefner asked her to be his assistant on cartoons, with the understanding that she might become cartoon editor in a year.         She did, although she said in an interview with The National Observer in 1971 that the job ''had some onus attached to it'': her predecessor had been a girlfriend of Mr. Hefner's, and gossip was inevitable. However, Ms. Urry said, she quickly demonstrated an indisputable knack for the work.         ''The fact that I brought to it an inordinately dirty mind was my own doing -- I mean, I don't think he expected that kind of bonus,'' she said. She also learned that appreciation of humor is almost instinctual. She told The National Observer that when people brought intellect to humor, the enjoyment was lost.         In the 1970's, it was cause for comment that Ms. Urry was working for Playboy despite her outspoken feminist beliefs. But she stoutly defended her magazine for backing feminist goals like access to abortion. She said that women posed nude to further their careers: ''No one ever coerced anybody to take their clothes off,'' she said in an interview with The Los Angeles Times in 1971.         Ms. Urry's first husband, Steven Urry, a sculptor, died in 1993. She is survived by her husband, Alan R. Trustman, a screenwriter, and a son, Caleb Urry.         One of Ms. Urry's big successes came from a visit to B. Kliban in his San Francisco studio in the 1970's. She bought six cartoons involving cats for $25, and urged Mr. Kliban to do a book. He became famous for his cat cartoons.         She once said her goal was to prod readers to think about something familiar in a different way. One cartoon she selected, by Chon Day, showed a gentleman in a club remarking, ''While other fellows were swapping wives, I traded mine for 100 shares of I.B.M.''       
         Anna Russell, the prima donna of operatic parody who claimed to have begun her career as ''leading soprano of the Ellis Island Opera Company,'' who said she learned to play the French horn from an article in the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and who gave indelibly grating performances of a song she identified as Blotz's ''Schlumpf'' to demonstrate what it is like to sing with ''no voice but great art,'' died on Wednesday in Bateman's Bay, New South Wales, Australia. She was 94.         Her death was confirmed by her adopted daughter, Deirdre Prussak, in an interview with the Australian ABC radio network, quoted on its Web site.         Ms. Russell's most enduring creations, now a half-century old, were associated with the most cultic portions of the art music repertory -- the works of Wagner and those of Gilbert and Sullivan. Her routines are still regularly invoked even though they can only be sampled on decades-old recordings of her performances.         Merely by telling the plot of Wagner's ''Ring of the Nibelungs'' in a voice laced with Edwardian-era class and postwar-era sarcasm, Ms. Russell affectionately sullied opera's most devotional experience.         ''I'm not making this up, you know,'' she said when her account of the plot seemed to become particularly outrageous. That became her tag line -- and the title of her 1985 autobiography.         Similarly, her instructions about ''How to Write Your Own Gilbert and Sullivan Opera'' seemed to deflate the reputation for wit and effervescent fantasy the operettas had acquired. She provided ''all the necessary ingredients'' for do-it-yourselfers, offering a model prime example. She stirred together patter song and madrigal, paternal stubbornness and young love, class snobbery and babes switched at birth and led her star-crossed heroine, Pneumonia Vanderfeller, to happiness and ever-greater wealth.         It was, though, not as a pedagogue, musicologist, singer, analyst and critic that she made her mark, but as an entertainer. In her first major successful season, 1952-53, she performed in 37 cities in the Unites States and Canada before an estimated 100,000 listeners. Her recording ''Anna Russell Sings?'' became a best seller.         She was seen on television, Broadway, in film and on the opera stage, including appearances as the Witch in a New York City Opera production of ''Hansel and Gretel.'' By the late 1960's, she had announced her retirement, though she would occasionally emerge, like one of the aging divas she caricatured, for another farewell tour, the last, apparently, about 20 years ago.         In her routines, Ms. Russell tapped into a long tradition of deflating the highly formal manners of the concert hall and its devotees, making fun of bad voices and bad teaching, of all pomp and most circumstance, seeming like a Margaret Dumont figure from the Marx Brothers movies who had decided to join their rambunctious dismantling of pretense. But the affection and knowledge of an insider accompanied the jest, leaving the art form intact -- almost. Ms. Russell's was a career that could only have been a success at a time when classical music culture was near the center of popular awareness and public education.         Ms. Russell was born Claudia Anna Russell-Brown in London, Ontario, in Canada, on Dec. 27, 1911, though she later said she had been born in London, England, where early reports suggest her family had moved six months after her birth.         She was the only child of Colonel Claude Russell-Brown and Beatrice Magdalen Russell-Brown, and grew up in a home in which tradition, and music, ruled. For three generations every male on her father's side served in the British Army.         ''I was thoroughly done as I grew up,'' Ms. Russell told The New York Times in 1953, ''I was presented at court in 1934. I was a debutante. I was exposed to all the likely looking young men in the hope that one of them would marry me.'' One did, but the marriage was not a success. She later married Charles Goldhammer, an artist and teacher; the marriage was reported to have ended in 1954.         Ms. Russell gave a number of explanations for why her ambitions changed from being a serious singer to being a serious satirist. Ms. Russell said that one factor was that when she was 16, bones in her face were broken by a hockey stick: ''That ruined my acoustic.''         ''I had no range, no color,'' she said, ''But I could sing loud. And it grew louder and louder and awfuller and awfuller.''         That did not prevent her from singing folk songs on the BBC or studying at the Royal Academy. The main inspirational trauma for her career may have been a British touring company production of Mascagni's ''Cavalleria Rusticana,'' in which she sang Santuzza as a substitute. The tenor, who was supposed to shove her, did not expect her considerable girth and fell backward. She herself then tripped and literally brought the house down, the sets collapsing to the accompaniment of an audience roaring with laughter.         The performance was brought to an end. ''So was my career,'' she said. ''My life's work was shattered, after five years of hard preparation . . . But I got over it.''         On her first trip to New York, in 1947, she was initially met with skepticism. ''No one knew what to do with my kind of satire,'' she said. ''One agent told me, 'You can't do it in a nightclub, and you're not pretty enough to be on Broadway.' '' The key to satirizing concert life, it turns out, was to do it in concert.         After retiring in the late 1960's, Ms. Russell lived in Unionville, just north of Toronto, on a street named after her. She later moved to be with her adopted daughter in Australia, where she tried to establish a catering business.         In the 1970's and 80's, Ms. Russell would occasionally come out of retirement, like one of the aging divas she caricatured, for another ''farewell tour'' and the cheers of fans who did not mind her failing voice. She said that a friend told her: ''It doesn't matter what you sound like. You were no Lily Pons anyway.''         Correction:  October 28, 2006, Saturday  An obituary on Oct. 20 about Anna Russell, the parodist of opera, incorrectly rendered her claim of how she began her career. She said she had been the ''prima donna of the Ellis Island Opera House'' -- not the ''leading soprano of the Ellis Island Opera Company.''       
         Petra Cabot, whose first and deepest love was painting but whose most famous work was an insulated pail covered with plaid, the ubiquitous Skotch Kooler of the 1950s, died on Oct. 13 at her home in Woodstock, N.Y. She was 99.         Her friend Nancy Kline announced the death. Ms. Cabot also had a home in Manhattan.         The Skotch Kooler, copyrighted in 1952, was made by the Hamilton Metal Products Company of Hamilton, Ohio. It could keep ice cream firm for two to three hours without ice and was handy for a fishing trip: it kept groceries cold on the way to the lake and fish cold on the way back.         The container held four gallons and had three layers of insulation: one of fiberglass, one of inert air and a heat-reflecting outer surface. It was airtight and waterproof and, long before the practice was common, it carried the signature of its designer. (Knockoff versions, without the signature, were made as far away as Thailand.) The coolers are now popular collectibles.         ''I decided to make the best-looking bucket anybody ever saw,'' Ms. Cabot said, according to an interview several years ago with Ms. Kline's mother, Polly Kline.         Emma Mearns, who later changed her name to Petra (pronounced PEE-tra), was an only child born in Philadelphia on Feb. 21, 1907. She was educated in crafts and fine arts and started winning design prizes in her teens.         She designed costumes and sets for stage productions, then spent a year painting in Europe. In the Depression years, she participated in two federally sponsored arts projects and became involved in the lively art scene in and around Woodstock. She also taught at the City and Country School in Manhattan.         In 1945, she designed a mural depicting the history of the National Maritime Union. It occupied 840 square feet of wall space in the union's Manhattan offices, now a hotel, and was a montage of newspaper clippings and photographs.         From 1938 until 1950, she worked for the designer Russel Wright, who brought modernism to the American home with his inexpensive, mass-produced dinnerware, furniture, appliances and textiles. One of Ms. Cabot's first assignments for Wright was the food pavilion at the New York World's Fair of 1939, which received favorable mention from critics.         Ms. Cabot married Laurence Jordan, a poet, when she was 19; the marriage ended in divorce in 1931. In 1937, she married Blake Cabot, a medical writer and publisher, who died in 1974. She left no immediate survivors.       
         Rosamond Carr, a Manhattan fashion illustrator whose love affair with Africa long survived her divorce from the dashing big-game hunter she followed there and culminated when she, as an octogenarian, opened an orphanage in war-ravaged Rwanda, died on Sept. 29. She was 94.         She died of pneumonia at her home near Gisenyi in the mountains of northwest Rwanda, said Ann Howard Halsey, her niece.         Mrs. Carr owned a flower plantation in a volcanic paradise, was stalked by leopards, pestered by elephants and cuddled by monkeys and became a close friend of Dian Fossey, the mountain gorilla researcher, who was mysteriously killed in 1985.         Mrs. Carr became a successful businesswoman at a time when they were rare in Africa. She endured political turmoil most Westerners fled. But her world was upended when Rwanda's Hutu massacred another of the country's ethnic groups, the Tutsi, and killings were committed on her property, eight of them in her flower garden.         When the spear-wielding mob demanded to know the whereabouts of yet another potential victim, Mrs. Carr exploded.         ''You don't mind killing old women,'' she said, as recorded in her 1999 autobiography, ''Land of a Thousand Hills: My Life in Rwanda.'' ''If you want to kill someone, here I am. Kill me!''         Mrs. Carr was forced to flee on five minutes' notice. Once in the United States, as televised images made the magnitude of the tragedy apparent -- perhaps 800,000 dead, two million exiled, two million more in refuge camps in Rwanda -- she made a decision.         It involved a capacious building she had used to dry flowers. It somehow seemed like the perfect place for an orphanage. With arduous work, it became one.         ''One of the few regrets in my life is that I never had children of my own,'' she wrote, three years after the arrival of the first orphan, a boy named Gahungu, whose mother had dropped dead in front of him. ''Today at the age of 85, I am blessed with 72,'' she said.         Mrs. Carr's life does not merely sound cinematic. The actress Julie Harris played her in ''Gorillas in the Mist,'' the movie about Ms. Fossey. A British company is making a documentary about Mrs. Carr, and producers have bought rights to her book, which Ms. Halsey helped write.         Rosamond Halsey was born in 1912 in South Orange, N.J. Her father was a bond trader ruined by the Depression, and college was not an option. She became an illustrator for department stores.         She happened to see some films about Africa presented by Kenneth Carr, who had lived there for 28 years, hunting big game and working as a tattoo artist, coffee planter and miner. An Englishman, he was a charming conversationalist and gave her a lion's claw covered with gold. They married, struggled financially and soon had trouble getting along. They decided that moving to Africa might help.         ''Most people would go to a marriage counselor, but they went to Africa,'' Ms. Halsey said.         Mrs. Carr, then 37, bought four cotton dresses, a pith helmet ''and a lifetime supply of cold cream'' and the two sailed away on a tramp steamer. They chugged 1,280 miles up the Congo River in a wood-burning paddle-wheel steamer, then drove a second-hand Ford pickup to the Congo-Rwanda border, where they eventually managed a farm.         It was beautiful and exotic: there was a 50-foot waterfall on their property, wildlife prowled, and Mrs. Carr became fascinated by local culture. She dispensed medicine to the people.         The marriage foundered, and in the mid-1950's, Mrs. Carr bought a 270-acre flower plantation in the foothills of the Virunga volcanoes. She lived in an ivy-covered stone cottage and planted a formal English garden. She grew fields of lilies and other flowers to sell.         After Belgium granted independence to the Congo in 1960, most Europeans (with whom Americans were lumped) left. After Rwanda became independent 1962, the dominant Hutu took control, and persecuted the minority Tutsi, who had historically ruled. Year by year, tensions mounted.         Mrs. Carr stayed. She befriended Ms. Fossey, who had moved to Rwanda because of violence in Congo. Theirs was a close but stormy relationship, beginning with an argument about where Rwandan gorillas were and were not. Mrs. Carr was right.         Rwanda's genocide started in 1994 after President Juvénal Habyarimana was assassinated. The Hutu government and Hutu gangs mercilessly attacked Tutsi. Waves of retaliations by Tutsi and counterretaliations by Hutu followed.         Violence prevented Mrs. Carr and her 120 orphans from returning to their original home until November 2006. The orphanage, now on a larger, more modern campus, is run by her longtime associates.         Mrs. Carr is survived by her brother, William G. Halsey, of Basking Ridge, N.J., and her sister, Dorothy K. Halsey, of Chatham, Mass.         In her book, Mrs. Carr rhapsodized about relaxing at day's end in front of a crackling fire in a cozy cottage that never had electricity or modern plumbing.         ''My day is done,'' she wrote, ''and I wonder with a flutter of anticipation what new adventures and surprises tomorrow will bring.''         Correction:  October 10, 2006, Tuesday  Because of an editing error, an obituary on Sunday about Rosamond Carr, a former fashion illustrator who opened an orphanage in Rwanda and was driven from it by violence, misstated the date of the orphans' return to the facility. It was November 2005, not November 2006.       
         Ruth Brown, the gutsy rhythm and blues singer whose career extended to acting and crusading for musicians' rights, died yesterday in Las Vegas. She was 78 and lived in Las Vegas.         The cause was complications following a heart attack and a stroke she suffered after surgery, and Ms. Brown had been on life support since Oct. 29, said her friend, lawyer and executor, Howell Begle.         ''She was one of the original divas,'' said the singer Bonnie Raitt, who worked with Ms. Brown and Mr. Begle to improve royalties for rhythm and blues performers. ''I can't really say that I've heard anyone that sounds like Ruth, before or after. She was a combination of sass and innocence, and she was extremely funky. She could really put it right on the beat, and the tone of her voice was just mighty. And she had a great heart.''         ''What I loved about her,'' Ms. Raitt added, ''was her combination of vulnerability and resilience and fighting spirit. It was not arrogance, but she was just really not going to lay down and roll over for anyone.''         Ms. Brown sustained a career for six decades: first as a bright, bluesy singer who was called ''the girl with a tear in her voice'' and then, after some lean years, as the embodiment of an earthy, indomitable black woman. She had a life of hard work, hard luck, determination, audacity and style. Sometimes it was said that R&B stood as much for Ruth Brown as it did for rhythm and blues.         As the 1950s began, Ms. Brown's singles for the fledgling Atlantic Records -- like ''(Mama) He Treats Your Daughter Mean'' and ''5-10-15 Hours'' -- became both the label's bankroll and templates for all of rock 'n' roll. She could sound as if she were hurting, or joyfully lusty, or both at once. Her voice was forthright, feisty and ready for anything.         After Ms. Brown's string of hits ended, she kept singing but also went on to a career in television, radio and movies ( including a memorable role as the disc jockey Motormouth Maybelle in John Waters's ''Hairspray'') and on Broadway, where she won a Tony Award for her part in ''Black and Blue.'' She worked clubs, concerts and festivals into the 21st century.         ''Whatever I have to say, I get it said,'' she said in an interview with The New York Times in 1995. ''Like the old spirituals say, 'I've gone too far to turn me 'round now.' ''         Ms. Brown was born Ruth Weston on Jan. 12, 1928, in Portsmouth, Va., the oldest of seven children. She made her debut when she was 4, and her father, the choir director at the local Emmanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, lifted her onto the church piano. In summers, she and her siblings picked cotton at her grandmother's farm in North Carolina. ''That made me the strong woman I am,'' she said in 1995.         As a teenager, she would tell her family she was going to choir practice and perform instead at U.S.O. clubs at nearby naval stations. She ran away from home at 17, working with a trumpeter named Jimmy Brown and using his last name onstage. She married him, or thought she did; he was already married. But she was making a reputation as Ruth Brown, and the name stuck.         The big-band leader Lucky Millinder heard her in Detroit late in 1946, hired her for his band and fired her in Washington, D.C. . Stranded, she managed to find a club engagement at the Crystal Caverns. There, the disc jockey Willis Conover, who broadcast jazz internationally on Voice of America radio, heard Ms. Brown and recommended her to friends at Atlantic Records.         On the way to New York City, however, she was seriously injured in an automobile accident and hospitalized for most of a year; her legs, which were smashed, would be painful for the rest of her life. She stood on crutches in 1949 to record her first session for Atlantic, and the bluesy ballad ''So Long'' became a hit.         She wanted to keep singing ballads, but Atlantic pushed her to try upbeat songs, and she tore into them. During the sessions for ''Teardrops From My Eyes,'' her voice cracked upward to a squeal. Herb Abramson of Atlantic Records liked it, called it a ''tear,'' and after ''Teardrops'' reached No. 1 on the rhythm and blues chart, the sound became her trademark for a string of hits.         ''If I was getting ready to go and record and I had a bad throat, they'd say, 'Good!','' she once recalled.         Ms. Brown was the best-selling black female performer of the early 1950s, even though, in that segregated era, many of her songs were picked up and redone by white singers, like Patti Page and Georgia Gibbs, in tamer versions that became pop hits. The pop singer Frankie Laine gave her a lasting nickname: Miss Rhythm.         Working the rhythm and blues circuit in the 1950s, when dozens of her singles reached the R&B Top 10, Ms. Brown drove a Cadillac and had romances with stars like the saxophonist Willis (Gator Tail) Jackson and the singer Clyde McPhatter of the Drifters. (Her first son, Ronald, was given the last name Jackson; decades later, she told him he was actually Mr. McPhatter's son, and he now sings with a latter-day lineup of the Drifters.)         In 1955 Ms. Brown married Earl Swanson, a saxophonist, and had a second son, Earl; the marriage ended in divorce. Her two sons survive her: Mr. Jackson, who has three children, of Los Angeles, and Mr. Swanson of Las Vegas. She is also survived by four siblings: Delia Weston of Las Vegas, Leonard Weston of Long Island and Alvin and Benjamin Weston of Portsmouth.         Her streak of hits ended soon after the 1960s began. She lived on Long Island, raised her sons, worked as a teacher's aide and a maid and was married for three years to a police officer, Bill Blunt. On weekends she sang club dates in the New York area, and she recorded an album in 1968 with the Thad Jones-Mel Lewis Big Band. Although her hits had supported Atlantic Records -- sometimes called the House That Ruth Built -- she was unable at one point to afford a home telephone.         The comedian Redd Foxx, whom she had once helped out of a financial jam, invited her to Los Angeles in 1975 to play the gospel singer Mahalia Jackson in ''Selma,'' a musical about civil rights he was producing.         She went on to sing in Las Vegas and continued a comeback that never ended. The television producer Norman Lear gave her a role in the sitcom ''Hello, Larry.'' She returned to New York City in 1982, appearing in Off Broadway productions including ''Stagger Lee,'' and in 1985 she went to Paris to perform in the revue ''Black and Blue,'' rejoining it later for its Broadway run.         Ms. Brown began to speak out, onstage and in interviews, about the exploitative contracts musicians of her generation had signed. Many hit-making musicians had not recouped debts to their labels, according to record company accounting, and so were not receiving royalties at all. Shortly before Atlantic held a 40th-birthday concert at Madison Square Garden in 1988, the label agreed to waive unrecouped debts for Ms. Brown and 35 other musicians of her era and to pay 20 years of retroactive royalties.         Atlantic also contributed nearly $2 million to start the Rhythm and Blues Foundation, which pushed other labels toward royalty reform and distributed millions of dollars directly to musicians in need, although it has struggled to sustain itself in recent years.         ''Black and Blue'' revitalized Ms. Brown's recording career, on labels including Fantasy and Bullseye Blues. Her 1989 album ''Blues on Broadway'' won a Grammy Award for best jazz vocal performance, female. She was a radio host on the public radio shows ''Harlem Hit Parade'' and ''BluesStage.'' In 1995 she released her autobiography, ''Miss Rhythm'' (Dutton), written with Andrew Yule; it won the Gleason Award for music journalism. She was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993.         She toured steadily, working concert halls, festivals and cabarets. This year she recorded songs for the coming movie by John Sayles, ''Honeydripper,'' and was about to fly to Alabama to act in it when she became ill.         Ms. Brown never learned to read music. ''In school we had music classes, but I ducked them,'' she said in 1995. ''They were just a little too slow. I didn't want to learn to read no note. I knew I could sing it. I woke up one morning and I could sing.''       
         Betty Comden, who with her longtime collaborator Adolph Green wrote the lyrics and often the librettos for some of the most celebrated musicals of stage and screen, died yesterday in Manhattan. She was 89 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was heart failure, said Ronald Konecky, her lawyer and the executor of her estate.         During a professional partnership that lasted for more than 60 years, and which finally ended with Mr. Green's death in 2002, the Comden-Green blend of sophisticated wit and musical know-how lit up stage shows like ''On the Town,'' ''Wonderful Town,'' ''Peter Pan'' and ''Bells Are Ringing.'' Their Hollywood credits included the screenplays for two landmark film musicals, ''Singin' in the Rain'' and ''The Band Wagon.''         Through the years they worked with composers like Leonard Bernstein, Cy Coleman, Jule Styne and André Previn, creating songs like ''New York, New York,'' ''The Party's Over,'' ''It's Love'' and ''Some Other Time.'' They were adept at making their lyrics fit the mood, whether it was rueful (''Lonely Town''), raucous (''100 Easy Ways to Lose a Man'') or romantic (''Just in Time'').         The title of one of their own songs, from ''Bells Are Ringing,'' summed up their joint career: it was truly a ''Perfect Relationship'' in which they met daily, most often in Ms. Comden's living room, either to work on a show, to trade ideas or even just talk about the weather.         ''We stare at each other,'' Ms. Comden said in a 1977 interview with The New York Times. ''We meet, whether or not we have a project, just to keep up a continuity of working. There are long periods when nothing happens, and it's just boring and disheartening. But we have a theory that nothing's wasted, even those long days of staring at one another. You sort of have to believe that, don't you? That you had to go through all that to get to the day when something did happen.''         Ms. Comden, slim, dark-haired and composed, was the ideal counterbalance to the often rumpled, wild-haired and restless Mr. Green. Sometimes, during discussions, Ms. Comden would finish one of his sentences, or vice versa. Songs and shows grew that way too, although the story was always the starting point.         ''The book comes first,'' Ms. Comden said in the 1977 interview , recalling how the song ''Just in Time'' took shape. ''At some point when we were working on 'Bells Are Ringing,' '' she said, ''Jule Styne wrote that tune. Dee da dum, da dee da dee da dum. We all agreed it had to be in the show somewhere, but for months we couldn't find a place for it, or even a title, but Jule was playing it all over town at parties, calling it 'Dee Da Dum.' And that became the official title until the point where, rewriting part of the book one day, the situation was there, and we finally wrote the words to fit 'Dee Da Dum.' ''         The starting point for their partnership was Greenwich Village where, in the late 1930s, they joined up with another aspiring entertainer named Judy Holliday and two other friends to form a cabaret act. They called themselves the Revuers and persuaded Max Gordon, the owner of a club called the Village Vanguard, that their act would be good for business. It was.         The Revuers opened at the Vanguard in 1939, performing material that included freewheeling sketches like ''The Banshi Sisters'' and ''The Baroness Bazuka,'' a zany operetta, and frequently accompanied at the piano by one of Mr. Green's friends, a talented young musician named Leonard Bernstein, who dropped in often enough to be taken for part of their act.         The act's success earned them a movie offer, and the Revuers traveled west in hopes of finding instant fame in ''Greenwich Village,'' a 1944 movie starring Carmen Miranda and Don Ameche, in which the newcomers turned out to be virtually invisible. Ms. Comden and Mr. Green came back to New York, where they resumed working at the Vanguard and other clubs.         It wasn't long before they heard from Mr. Bernstein, their erstwhile accompanist, who said he'd been working on a ballet with Jerome Robbins and that the two of them had decided that the ballet, called ''Fancy Free,'' had the makings of a Broadway show. They were looking for someone to write the book and lyrics.         Ms. Comden and Mr. Green jumped at the chance and jumped into the limelight with their work on the show. The result, ''On the Town,'' the story of three sailors on shore leave in New York, opened late in 1944 and was a smash. Both Ms. Comden and Mr. Green appeared in the show, he as one of the sailors and she as Claire de Loone, an amorous anthropologist. New Yorkers inside and outside the theater were soon humming the town's geography à la Comden and Green:         The Bronx is up and the Battery's down,         The people ride in a hole in the ground,         New York, New York,         It's a helluva town.         Ms. Comden and Mr. Green were definitely on their way up, not to the Bronx but to big-time success.         Betty Comden was born Elizabeth Cohen on May 3, 1917, in Brooklyn. Her father, Leo, was a lawyer, her mother, Rebecca, a teacher. She attended Erasmus Hall High School and studied drama at New York University, graduating in 1938.         By that time she had changed her surname to Comden, had had nose surgery to make her look more stageworthy, had acted with the Washington Square Players and had met and become friends with Mr. Green, another aspiring actor. Their circle soon included three other would-be entertainers, Ms. Holliday, Alvin Hammer and John Frank. Then came their decision to form the Revuers, and all else followed.         Ms. Comden married Steven Kyle, a designer and businessman, in 1942. He died in 1979, and she never remarried. They had two children, a daughter, Susanna, and a son, Alan. Their son, a drug addict, contracted AIDS and died of complications of his addiction in 1990. She is survived by her daughter, Susanna Kyle, of Manhattan.         Ms. Comden reminisced about her Brooklyn childhood, her student years and her long marriage in a 1995 memoir, ''Off Stage,'' in which she also told of the difficult circumstances of her son's struggle with drugs. The book included tributes to some of her friends and colleagues, among them Mr. Bernstein and Lauren Bacall, but hardly dealt at all with her professional life.         After the success of ''On the Town,'' Ms. Comden and Mr. Green tried their hands at writing the book for another Broadway musical. ''Billion Dollar Baby,'' which opened in 1945, had a score by Morton Gould, choreography by Mr. Robbins and was directed by George Abbott, but it was not as well received.         Hollywood called again, and this time, for the most part, they had better luck. ''Good News'' (1947), with June Allyson and Peter Lawford as singing, dancing campus sweethearts, was their first screenplay. They wrote ''The Barkleys of Broadway'' (1949), which marked the film reunion of Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire, and adapted ''On the Town'' (1949) for the screen, with Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra and Jules Munshin as the freewheeling sailors navigating the streets of New York.         They contributed heavily to the success of ''The Band Wagon'' (1953), the Vincente Minnelli musical for which they wrote the witty screenplay. The film had a score by Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz and starred Mr. Astaire, Cyd Charisse, Oscar Levant and Nanette Fabray. The Comden-Green screenplay received an Academy Award nomination.         They were still wedded to Broadway, however, and their stage work during the next few years included the Jule Styne musical ''Two on the Aisle'' (1951), a revue with Bert Lahr and Dolores Gray; ''Wonderful Town'' (1953), an adaptation of the 1939 comedy hit ''My Sister Eileen,'' with music by Mr. Bernstein and starring Rosalind Russell and Edie Adams as two sisters from Ohio trying to make it in the Big Town; and, most notably, ''Bells Are Ringing.''         That 1956 musical reunited them with Ms. Holliday, who headed the cast as an operator at an answering service who falls in love with one of the service's male clients (Sydney Chaplin) after listening to his voice over her telephone line. The score included the comic lament ''I'm Going Back (To the Bonjour Tristesse Brassiere Company)'' as well as some songs that became part of the standard pop repertory, like ''Just in Time,'' ''Long Before I Knew You'' and ''The Party's Over,'' which ended with the melancholy verse:         Now you must wake up         All dreams must end         Take off your makeup         The party's over         It's all over, my friend.         Ms. Comden and Mr. Green also wrote the screenplay for the 1960 film version, which starred Ms. Holliday.         Even their less successful shows yielded musical nuggets, one example being the 1960 ''Do Re Mi,'' which had a book by Garson Kanin and music by Mr. Styne for which they wrote the lyrics. It featured Phil Silvers and Nancy Walker. That largely unmemorable score included one gem, ''Make Someone Happy.''         Ms. Comden and Mr. Green went on to write ''Subways Are for Sleeping'' (1961), with Carol Lawrence and Mr. Chaplin, and ''Fade Out-Fade In'' (1964), with Carol Burnett and Jack Cassidy, both shows with music by Mr. Styne, and the lyrics for ''Hallelujah, Baby'' (1968), which had music by Mr. Styne and a book by Arthur Laurents and which starred Leslie Uggams and Robert Hooks. They wrote the book for ''Applause'' (1970), adapted from the film ''All About Eve,'' with music by Charles Strouse and lyrics by Lee Adams. The show starred Ms. Bacall as the take-no-prisoners movie queen Margo Channing played by Bette Davis in the film.         In the years that followed Ms. Comden and Mr. Green teamed up with the composer Cy Coleman for ''On the Twentieth Century'' (1978), based on the Ben Hecht-Charles MacArthur play about a flamboyant movie producer (John Cullum) and his leading lady (Madeline Kahn), traveling from Hollywood to Broadway on the Twentieth-Century Limited in the 1930s. The show was a hit and brought them Tony Awards for their book and score.         In 1982 they wrote the book and lyrics -- Larry Grossman wrote the music -- for what was meant to be a kind of musical sequel to Ibsen's ''A Doll's House,'' but the result, ''A Doll's Life'' (1982), was a four-performance disaster.         Their last major Broadway show was ''The Will Rogers Follies,'' a 1991 Ziegfeld-style extravaganza with music by Mr. Coleman, book by Peter Stone and direction and choreography by Tommy Tune. Keith Carradine starred as the folksy humorist-philosopher. Despite mixed reviews the show won six Tony Awards, including one for the music and lyrics, and enjoyed a run of two and a half years.         By the time ''Will Rogers'' came along, Ms. Comden and Mr. Green had worked together for more than a half-century. On Broadway, starting with ''On the Town'' in 1944, they had won a shelf full of Tony Awards. They were among the recipients of the 1991 Kennedy Center honors for their contributions to American musical theater.         Their early Hollywood credits included ''Take Me Out to the Ball Game'' (1949), with Gene Kelly, Mr. Sinatra and Esther Williams, and ''It's Always Fair Weather'' (1955), with Mr. Kelly, Dan Dailey, Michael Kidd and Ms. Charisse, for which their screenplay received an Academy Award nomination. A bittersweet sequel of sorts to ''On the Town,'' the plot of ''It's Always Fair Weather'' revolved around the reunion a decade after World War II of three former G.I. companions who find that time has altered their friendship for the worse.         ''I don't think there's ever been a musical quite like it,'' Ms. Comden said in a 1999 interview with The Times. ''The corrosive effect that time has on friendships -- that's a very unusual subject for a musical.'' She and Mr. Green said it was one of their favorites.         After their stage debut in ''On the Town'' they didn't perform on Broadway again until 1958, when they appeared in ''A Party with Betty Comden and Adolph Green,'' a revue that included some of their early favorites like ''The Baroness Bazuka,'' which they described as a tribute to the Shubert brothers (''J. J., O. O., and Uh-Uh.''). The revue was well received, and they brought an updated version back to Broadway in 1977.         Ms. Comden also performed in films from time to time. She acted in Sidney Lumet's ''Garbo Talks'' (1984), in which Mr. Green also made a fleeting appearance, and James Ivory's ''Slaves of New York'' (1989). She appeared onstage in 1983 in a rare dramatic role in Wendy Wasserstein's ''Isn't It Romantic,'' playing the mother of a footloose girl waiting for Mr. Right to come along.         In 1999 Ms. Comden and Mr. Green were saluted by their peers in a two-night program at Carnegie Hall. Elaine Stritch and Brian Stokes Mitchell were among the performers who sang numbers from the Comden-Green repertoire.         Recent Broadway revivals of their work included a 2001 production of ''Bells Are Ringing'' starring Faith Prince, which closed after a brief run, and the 2003 revival of ''Wonderful Town'' with Donna Murphy, which settled in for a long stay at the Al Hirschfeld Theater.         After Mr. Green's death in October 2002, Broadway turned out in force two months later for a memorial program at the Shubert Theater. Kevin Kline, Joel Grey, Ms. Bacall and others paid affectionate tribute to Mr. Green in song and story. At one point during her own reminiscence about him, Ms. Comden paused and said to the audience, ''It's lonely up here.'' After six decades the perfect relationship was over.         Correction:  February 26, 2007, Monday  An obituary on Nov. 24 about the Broadway lyricist Betty Comden misstated her given name at birth. Although the name Elizabeth is widely reported in reference works, she was named Basya Cohen and was never called Elizabeth, according to her memoir, ''Off Stage.'' (She chose the name Betty because Basya is pronounced Bahssie and she wanted to avoid the nickname for a cow, Bossy.) A reader pointed out the error in an e-mail message on Tuesday, and this correction was further delayed for research.       
         Bebe Moore Campbell, a best-selling novelist known for her empathetic treatment of the difficult, intertwined and occasionally surprising relationship between the races, died yesterday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 56.         The cause was complications of brain cancer, said Linda Wharton-Boyd, a longtime friend.         Along with writers like Terry McMillan, Ms. Campbell was part of the first wave of black novelists who made the lives of upwardly mobile black people a routine subject for popular fiction. Straddling the divide between literary and mass-market novels, Ms. Campbell's work explored not only the turbulent dance between blacks and whites but also the equally fraught relationship between men and women.         Throughout her work, Ms. Campbell sought to counter prevailing stereotypes of black people as socially and economically marginal. Though critics occasionally faulted her characters as two-dimensional, her novels were known for their crossover appeal, read by blacks and whites alike.         Often called on by the news media to discuss race relations, Ms. Campbell was for years a familiar presence on television and radio. With the publication of her most recent novel, ''72 Hour Hold'' (Knopf, 2005), she also became a visible spokeswoman on mental-health issues. The novel, about bipolar disorder, was inspired by the experience of a family member, Ms. Campbell said.         Originally a schoolteacher and later a journalist, Ms. Campbell made her mark as a writer of fiction with her first novel, ''Your Blues Ain't Like Mine'' (Putnam), published in 1992. Rooted in the story of Emmett Till, the book tells of a black Chicago youth killed by a white man in Mississippi in 1955. After the murderer is acquitted at trial, the narrative follows his increasing dissolution.         ''I wanted to give racism a face,'' Ms. Campbell said in an interview with The New York Times Book Review in 1992. ''African-Americans know about racism, but I don't think we really know the causes. I decided it's first of all a family problem.''         Reviewing the novel in The Book Review, Clyde Edgerton wrote: ''By showing lives lived, and not explaining ideas, Ms. Campbell does what good storytellers do -- she puts in by leaving out.''         Ms. Campbell's other novels, all published by G. P. Putnam's Sons, are ''Brothers and Sisters'' (1994), written in the wake of the Los Angeles riots of 1992; ''Singing in the Comeback Choir'' (1998), about a black television producer feeling cut off from her roots; and ''What You Owe Me'' (2001), about the friendship between two women, one African-American, the other a Jewish Holocaust survivor, in the 1940's.         Elizabeth Bebe Moore was born in Philadelphia on Feb. 18, 1950, to parents who divorced when she was very young. Bebe spent each school year in Philadelphia with her mother, grandmother and aunt -- strong, upright women she collectively called ''the Bosoms'' -- who set her on a course of study, discipline and staunch middle-class respectability.         She spent summers in North Carolina with her father, who had been paralyzed in an automobile accident. There, she was enveloped in a heady world of beer, laughter and cigar smoke. She documented her contrasting lives in her memoir, ''Sweet Summer: Growing Up With and Without My Dad'' (Putnam, 1989).         After earning a bachelor's degree in elementary education from the University of Pittsburgh in 1971, Ms. Campbell taught school in Atlanta for several years before embarking on a career as a freelance journalist. Her first book was a work of nonfiction, ''Successful Women, Angry Men: Backlash in the Two-Career Marriage'' (Random House, 1986).         She also wrote two picture books for children, ''Sometimes My Mommy Gets Angry'' (Putnam, 2003; illustrated by E. B. Lewis); and ''Stompin' at the Savoy'' (Philomel, 2006; illustrated by Richard Yarde).         Ms. Campbell's first marriage, to Tiko Campbell, ended in divorce. She is survived by her husband, Ellis Gordon Jr., whom she married in 1984; her mother, Doris Moore of Los Angeles; a daughter from her first marriage, Maia Campbell of Los Angeles; a stepson, Ellis Gordon III of Mitchellville, Md.; and two grandchildren.         Despite the subject matter of her books, Ms. Campbell expressed hope about the future of American race relations. In an interview with The New York Times in 1995, she described her motivation for writing ''Brothers and Sisters,'' the story of the friendship between a black banker and her white colleague.         ''It was my attempt to bridge a racial gap,'' Ms. Campbell said. ''That's the story that never gets told: how many of us really like each other, respect each other.''       
         Adrienne Shelly, an actress, film writer and director who first gained recognition for her roles in Hal Hartley's dark comedies ''The Unbelievable Truth'' and ''Trust,'' was found dead on Wednesday at her office in Greenwich Village. She was 40.         Grace Brugess, a spokeswoman for the New York City Medical Examiner's Office, said yesterday that further tests would be necessary to determine the cause of death.         Ms. Shelly played leading or featured roles in more than two dozen Off Broadway plays (many at the Workhouse Theater in Manhattan), in movies and on television shows. Last year she was featured in the movie ''Factotum,'' starring Matt Dillon. She had recently finished directing ''Waitress,'' a movie she wrote and directed, which is under consideration for inclusion in the Sundance Film Festival.         Ms. Shelly wrote and directed several other independent films, including ''Sudden Manhattan'' (1997), in which zany characters collide in Lower Manhattan, and ''I'll Take You There'' (1999), a romantic comedy about a real estate broker whose wife leaves him for his best friend.         Ms. Shelly, who changed her name from Adrienne Levine, was born on June 16, 1966, in Queens. She is survived by her husband, Andy Ostroy, and a daughter, Sophie.         Ms. Shelly started performing at 9 in arts camps on Long Island and upstate. She dropped out of Boston University after her junior year and moved to Manhattan.         She got her break in movies in 1989 when Mr. Hartley cast her as the lead in ''The Unbelievable Truth,'' his bizarre comedy about a high school senior obsessed with nuclear annihilation. A year later, with Ms. Shelly in mind, Mr. Hartley revised a script he had written as a film student, ''Trust,'' another dark comedy, which touched on child abuse, abortion and mental illness. In 1993 Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times that Ms. Shelly was ''a spirited and captivating actress capable of perfect deadpan delivery.''         Pointing out that her acting style was often described as ''quirky,'' Ms. Shelly once said that ''when you read 'quirky' over and over again, 'quirky' starts to feel like an insult.'' In 2002 her performance in the movie ''Revolution No. 9,'' a psychodrama in which she played the fiancée of a young man slipping into schizophrenia, was described by the Times critic A. O. Scott as ''subtle and restrained.''       
         Anne Rogers Clark, a commanding figure in the world of show dogs who won renown at the Westminster Dog Show as a handler, a judge and a breeder, died Wednesday in Wilmington, Del., at the home of a friend. She was 77 and a longtime resident of Greenwood, Del.         The cause was kidney failure associated with colon cancer, said Thomas H. Bradley III, the chairman of the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show.         At 6 feet 2 inches, Mrs. Clark was an imposing and instantly recognizable presence in the show ring. For six decades, she was a fixture at Westminster, and she holds many of its records. Among them, she was the first woman to win best in show as a professional handler, and she ranked second among all handlers with three best in shows.         She also shared the record for most judging appearances at Westminster, with 22. She would have broken that record in February, when she was scheduled to be judge of the terrier group at Madison Square Garden.         A walking encyclopedia on the standards of more than 400 breeds worldwide, she was one of only two dozen people licensed to judge all 165 breeds and varieties recognized by the American Kennel Club.         She had more than a deep knowledge of dogs, though; she had a way with them.         ''Dogs responded to her,'' Mr. Bradley said. ''As a judge, she was authoritative and friendly. Some dogs who were shown to her many times would even recognize her. They would wag their tails when they saw her.''         Born in 1929 in Flushing, Queens, Anne Rogers was the great-granddaughter of a 19th-century mayor of New York, Philip Hone, and a second-generation dog person. Her mother, who ran a kennel in Pound Ridge, N.Y., started a successful dog department at Abercrombie & Fitch, then opened a grooming service in Manhattan called Dogs Inc.         Turning down a scholarship to the veterinary school at Cornell, Anne Rogers joined her mother's business after high school, then took to the show ring as a handler. She won her first best in show at Westminster in 1956, handling a toy poodle, Ch. Wilbur White Swan, the first dog from the toy group to win top honors there.         She turned to judging in 1967, two years after retiring as a handler. Although she said she was possibly the slowest judge in American Kennel Club history during her first few years, by 1973 she had worked her way to Westminster to judge the toy group. She judged the best in show in 1978.         Mrs. Clark was also a winner at Westminster as a breeder. She and her husband, James, captured non-sporting-group honors with their standard poodle Ch. Rimskittle Ruffian in 1980. In 2002, her miniature poodle Ch. Surrey Spice Girl, which she bred with Barbara Furbush and her protégé Kaz Hosaka, won best in show.         Mrs. Clark's activities extended beyond Westminster. Until recently, she spent most weekends traveling around the country judging at specialty shows. She was a president of the Poodle Club of America and the English Cocker Spaniel Club of America, co-wrote ''The International Encyclopedia of Dogs'' and published a compilation of her monthly columns for Dogs in Review magazine called ''Annie on Dogs!''         Mrs. Clark, whose husband died in 1991, had no children and leaves no survivors. She did hope to leave a legacy in the world of registered purebreds.         ''I have to get through to you that I adore to judge,'' she was quoted as saying in The Wall Street Journal earlier this year. ''I look forward to walking in the ring. I feel when a class comes in, it's like a blank canvas, and if I'm lucky, I can paint on this canvas what the breed should be.''       
         Eleanor Thomas Elliott, an advocate for women's rights who successfully fought Columbia University's attempt to take over Barnard College in the early 1970s, died Sunday in Valhalla, N.Y. She was 80 and lived in Cross River, N.Y.         The cause was injuries from a car accident, said her brother-in-law, Osborn Elliott, the former editor of Newsweek and a former dean of the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism.         Ms. Elliott was chairwoman of the board at Barnard when she helped organize administrators, faculty members and students there to oppose a Columbia merger. ''If she hadn't held the line, it might well have gone the other way,'' said Helene Kaplan, a board member at the time and its chairwoman in the 1980s. ''Elly believed that Barnard offered something special for young women that could not be duplicated in a merged institution.''         Barnard, a women's college, is affiliated with its neighbor Columbia in Manhattan but maintains its independence.         Ms. Elliott led the Barnard board from 1973 to 1976. She was also a former board member of the National Organization for Women's Legal Defense and Education Fund. During the Reagan administration, she served on the National Advisory Council on Women's Educational Programs. ''She was a bridge for feminism into many traditional places,'' said the feminist leader Gloria Steinem, a friend.         In the early 1990s, Ms. Elliott was chairwoman of the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation in Princeton, N.J., which promotes excellence in teaching, the humanities and women's studies.         Eleanor Lansing Thomas Elliott was born in Manhattan on April 26, 1926. She graduated from Barnard in 1948 and became a writer and editor at Vogue magazine. Her husband of 48 years, John Elliott Jr., known as Jock, a former chairman of Ogilvy & Mather, the advertising firm, died last year. They had no children.       
         Rosie Lee Tompkins, a renowned African-American quiltmaker whose use of dazzling color and vivid geometric forms made her work internationally acclaimed despite her vehement efforts to remain completely unknown, was found dead on Friday at her home in Richmond, Calif. She was 70.         The cause of death had not been determined, Eli Leon, a quilt scholar and longtime friend, said yesterday.         In everyday life, Ms. Tompkins was Effie Mae Howard, a fiercely private woman who lived quietly in Richmond and worked as a practical nurse. As Rosie Lee Tompkins, the pseudonym under which her quilts were shown, she was exhibited, much to her chagrin, in prestigious museums and galleries in the United States and Japan.         Lavishly praised by critics, Ms. Tompkins's quilts are in the permanent collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Oakland Museum in California. Her work was included in the Whitney Biennial in 2002.         Writing in The New York Times the same year, Roberta Smith reviewed an exhibition of Ms. Tompkins's work at the Peter Blum Gallery in Manhattan: ''Unerring and intuitive in their sense of color, shape and scale, Ms. Tompkins's quilts are formidably joyful visual events that ignore the usual boundaries between cultures, histories and mediums.''         Born and raised in Arkansas, Ms. Tompkins was heir to the long tradition of black Southern quilting, a form of folk art whose best-known practitioners include the women of Gee's Bend, Ala. Their work, vibrant geometric quilts made from whatever scraps came to hand, became famous after it was shown at the Whitney in 2002 and 2003.         Ms. Tompkins's quilts are even more radical. Made of massed, vivid patches, they exude a barely controlled geometric anarchy. Stripes can be thrillingly off kilter. Patterns shift and fracture. The result, riotous mosaics in cloth, has been likened by critics to Modernist painting.         In traditional quilts, the fabric of choice is cotton. Ms. Tompkins's quilts can also include cut-up feed sacks, rayon, velvet, polyester, fake fur, wool and silk. Each material reflects light differently; in combination, they make her work look like something viewed through a prism.         Ms. Tompkins was born Effie Mae Martin on Sept. 6, 1936, in rural southeast Arkansas. (Effie Mae Howard was her married name.) One of 15 children, she picked cotton and helped her mother make quilts for the family. She left school before starting high school, and in 1958 settled in California.         There, she took classes in practical nursing and went to work in nursing homes. Around 1980, Ms. Tompkins started to quilt in earnest, producing hundreds of patchwork items of various sizes, showing them to almost no one outside her family.         She arrived at many of her designs -- abstract, improvisational and filled with deep personal significance -- after private prayer. Ms. Tompkins believed herself to be merely an instrument, Mr. Leon said. It was God, she felt, who designed the quilts and guided her hand.         She also believed that her phone was tapped. Sometimes she heard voices. She covered one wall of her bedroom with hangings, thick with appliquéd crosses, which she hoped would still them. They did not.         Even as her quilts gained renown, Ms. Tompkins revealed her true identity to only a handful of trusted associates, among them Mr. Leon, the quilt scholar. She never attended her out-of-town exhibitions. If a friend managed to drag her to a local exhibition of her work, she quietly slipped into the gallery anonymously.         ''Something she told me once was that despite the fact that nobody knew who she was, she felt like she had no privacy,'' Mr. Leon said by telephone yesterday. ''She felt like she lived in a glass house and people were watching her.''         Ms. Tompkins, who for deeply held reasons of her own refused to sign documents, rarely sold her work. Those quilts she did sell went for tens of thousands of dollars apiece, Mr. Leon said.         She was also fiercely circumspect about disclosing the names and whereabouts of family members. Mr. Leon was equally circumspect yesterday. It is known that Ms. Tompkins was married and divorced twice; survivors include her mother; several children and stepchildren; and many siblings, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.         A one-woman show of Ms. Tompkins's work is scheduled for next year at the Shelburne Museum in Shelburne, Vt., from May 20 to Oct. 31.         Correction:  December 8, 2006, Friday  An obituary on Wednesday about Rosie Lee Tompkins, a reclusive maker of improvisational quilts, misstated her response to having her work exhibited in museums and galleries in the United States and abroad. Although Ms. Tompkins always worked under a pseudonym to preserve her anonymity, rarely attended her own exhibitions and agreed to sell few of her quilts, she was nonetheless pleased -- not chagrined -- to have her work shown, Eli Leon, a quilt scholar and longtime friend, told The Times on Wednesday.         Correction:  December 13, 2006, Wednesday  Because of an editing error, an obituary last Wednesday about Rosie Lee Tompkins, a renowned quiltmaker, misstated the name of the museum that has her work in its permanent collection. It is the Oakland Museum of California, not the Oakland Museum.       
         Georgia Gibbs, a brassy-voiced pop singer who topped the charts in the 1950s with ''Kiss of Fire'' and other hits, died on Saturday in Manhattan, where she had lived for many years. She was 87.         The cause was pneumonia, said Leslie Gottlieb, a publicist and family friend. She said Ms. Gibbs had been undergoing treatment for leukemia in recent months at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, where she died.         During her years in show business, Ms. Gibbs was widely known by her full, magisterial title: Her Nibs, Miss Georgia Gibbs. ''Nibs'' in this sense denotes a person of importance; its etymology is uncertain.         Like many white singers of the period, Ms. Gibbs, who recorded her biggest hits for the Mercury label, was known in particular for her covers, often with bowdlerized lyrics, of R&B songs by black artists. She was also known for her versatility; her repertory included tangos like ''Kiss of Fire'' as well as torch songs, jazz, rock and novelty numbers.         Ms. Gibbs recorded three singles that sold more than a million copies each: ''Kiss of Fire,'' which reached No. 1 on the Billboard charts in 1952; ''Tweedle Dee'' which was No. 2 in 1955 (the song was originally introduced by LaVern Baker); and ''Dance With Me Henry'' (previously recorded by Etta James as ''Wallflower''), which was No. 1 in 1955.         A frequent guest on television and radio, Ms. Gibbs appeared with Ed Sullivan, Milton Berle, Bob Hope, Jimmy Durante and Garry Moore, among other notables. It was Mr. Moore who came up with the title Her Nibs.         Ms. Gibbs was born Frieda Lipschitz on Aug. 17, 1919, in Worcester, Mass. Her father died when she was very young, and she spent much of her childhood in an orphanage. There, Frieda discovered a talent for singing; by the time she was a teenager, she had left the orphanage and was supporting her family by working in Boston ballrooms. She made her early recordings, with Artie Shaw and other bandleaders, under the name Fredda Gibson.         In the late 1950's, Ms. Gibbs married Frank Gervasi, a journalist; he died in 1990. She is survived by a brother, Robert Gibson, of La Mesa, Calif.; and one step-grandchild.         In part because she chose to record less frequently after her marriage, Ms. Gibbs never attained the lasting fame of contemporaries like Rosemary Clooney and Patti Page. But in her heyday, she was so well known that the post office routinely delivered to her door overseas letters addressed simply, ''Her Nibs.''
