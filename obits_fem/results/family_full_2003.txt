         Agnes Eisenberger, a manager of classical musicians who was the president and owner of Colbert Artists Management, died on Thursday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 79 and lived in New York City and Pawling, N.Y.         The cause was cancer, said Charlotte Schroeder, who succeeds Ms. Eisenberger as president of Colbert Artists.         Ms. Eisenberger worked with Sir Georg Solti and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the soprano Joan Sutherland, the Juilliard String Quartet, the flutist Jean-Pierre Rampal and the bass James Morris, among many others.         She was also the manager of the pianist Alfred Brendel, starting early in his career, and was instrumental in his success in the United States.         Ms. Eisenberger was born in Vienna to a musical family and came to the United States as a child. She graduated from Adelphi University and in the early 1960's began to work for Colbert Artists as an assistant to the company's founders, Henry and Ann Colbert.         She became the owner and president after the retirement of Mrs. Colbert in 1991. (Mrs. Colbert died in 2001.)         Ms. Eisenberger had recently completed ''Brahms's Notebooks,'' a translation of a collection of poetry that Brahms admired, published in German in 1909. The book, with annotations and an introduction by Ms. Eisenberger, is to be issued by Pendragon Press in 2003.         Her marriage to the violist Paul Doktor ended in divorce. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Evelyn Abrams Mauss, whose lifelong political activism began when she organized the Junior International League for Peace and Freedom as a 14-year-old in 1929, died on Saturday at the Peninsula Hospital Center in Queens. She was 87 and lived in the Neponsit section of Queens.         She had passed out leaflets opposing an American attack on Iraq in Manhattan earlier and apparently suffered a heart attack on her return to Queens, her family said.         At her death, Dr. Mauss, a retired New York University physiologist, remained active in the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. She was on the executive committee of the New York chapter of Physicians for Social Responsibility and had an office at the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York, where she was a consultant.         A native of Manhattan, she was the granddaughter and daughter of league members and suffragists. Her father was Morris Abrams, a manufacturer and philanthropist. She graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1936 and received her doctorate in science from Johns Hopkins University three years later.         She is survived by her husband of 64 years, Dr. Irving Mauss; two sons, Steven and Peter, and a daughter, Susan Tunick, all of New York City; two brothers, Dr. Herbert L. Abrams of Neponsit and Mason Adams of Manhattan; and a granddaughter.       
         Sarah Pettit, a founding editor and former editor in chief of Out magazine, one of the first gay and lesbian publications with mainstream status, died yesterday at Columbia-Presbyterian Center of New York Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. She was 36. The cause was non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, her family said.         While attending Yale, where she received a bachelor of arts degree in 1988, she organized gay and lesbian cultural and political events. She moved to New York, and in 1989 became an editor of OutWeek, an alternative paper eager to bring a gay subculture to the surface.         In 1992, she joined Michael Goff in creating Out magazine, where she extended the magazine's cultural and political focus, and attracted a range of advertisers, including Calvin Klein and General Motors, that had not previously appeared in gay publications.         She became editor in chief in 1997 as Out magazine became one of the country's most influential gay and lesbian magazines. She was dismissed at the end of the year on the basis that the magazine wanted to change editorial focus. She sued, asserting sex discrimination and breach of contract. The case was settled out of court.         At her death, she was the senior editor of the Arts and Entertainment section at Newsweek magazine.         Ms. Pettit was born on Aug. 6, 1966, in Amsterdam, where her father, Frederick Pettit, was a banker. She spent her childhood in Paris; London; Bad Homburg, Germany; and Chappaqua, N.Y.         Besides her father, of Hillsborough, Calif., Ms. Pettit is survived by her mother, Jane Pettit of Washington, and two brothers, Benjamin Pettit of Washington and Baer Pettit of London.       
         Nell Carter, the robustly sassy singer and actress who exploded onto the New York musical stage in the Fats Waller revue ''Ain't Misbehavin' '' and went on to become a popular television star in the series ''Gimme a Break!,'' died yesterday at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 54.         Ms. Carter collapsed and was found by one of her sons, said her spokesman, Roger Lane. She had been in rehearsals for ''Raisin,'' a musical adaptation of the play ''A Raisin in the Sun,'' at a theater in Long Beach, Calif. A diabetic, Ms. Carter survived two brain aneurysms in 1992.         Although she stood only 4 feet 11 inches tall, she was a larger-than-life stage personality who never did things in half-measures. Along with Patti La Belle and Jennifer Holliday, she belonged to a select circle of theatrical pop-soul belters whose members reveled in high-powered vocal flamboyance. A typical performance by Ms. Carter reached into the fabric of a song and tore out its seams with feral flourishes.         As a singer and stage personality, Ms. Carter was also a natural comedian. Her vocal style was descended from the humorous gutbucket blues of Bessie Smith by way of Dinah Washington, whose singing also conveyed a seam of earthy amusement. The warmth and feeling for comedy that inflected her interpretations of even the saddest songs reflected Ms. Carter's desire to be what she called ''Judy Garland without the tragedy.''         For many, Ms. Carter's performances of songs like ''Honeysuckle Rose'' and ''Mean to Me'' were legendary. That show, a potpourri of mostly Fats Waller pieces, opened at the Manhattan Theater Club in February 1978, and moved to the Longacre Theater on Broadway three months later, running there for more than 1,600 performances. Ms. Carter won a Tony for best featured actress in that musical.         Three years later she won an Emmy for the NBC television production of the same show. Ms. Carter made such an indelible impression as a shimmying, bawdy old-time vaudevillian in ''Ain't Misbehavin' '' that she often found herself typecast as a rollicking good-time mama.         Her biggest success after ''Ain't Misbehavin' '' was the sitcom ''Gimme a Break!,'' in which she played Miss Nellie Ruth ''Nell'' Harper, the housekeeper and surrogate mother for a widowed California police chief and his three children. The show, which ran from 1981 to 1987, earned her two Emmy nominations and revived the archetype of the mammy, an African-American woman caring for a white family.         Nell Carter was born Nell Hardy in Birmingham, Ala., on Sept. 13, 1948. While growing up, she absorbed her mother's recordings of Dinah Washington and B. B. King, along with her brother's Elvis Presley records. As a child, she sang on the gospel circuit and performed on a weekly radio show, ''The Y Teens.'' Later she sang in local coffeehouses.         Moving to New York at 19, she studied acting and performed in nightclubs like Reno Sweeney, the Village Gate, Dangerfield's, the Apartment and the Rainbow Room. ''Ain't Misbehavin' '' was the springboard to a wide-ranging singing and acting career.         Her television credits ranged from a role on the soap opera ''Ryan's Hope'' to an appearance on the acclaimed PBS special ''Baryshnikov on Broadway'' to game-show contestant on ''Match Game.'' Her theater credits include ''Hello Dolly!,'' ''Hair,'' ''Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope,'' ''Jesus Christ Superstar'' and ''Bubbling Brown Sugar.''         She had film roles in ''The Grass Harp'' (1995) and ''The Proprietor'' (1996).         Married and divorced twice, Ms. Carter is survived by a daughter, Tracy, and by two sons, Joshua and Daniel.       
         Mary Brian, a film star and memorable ingénue who bridged the silent and early sound eras, died on Monday in Del Mar, Calif. She was 96 and lived in Los Angeles.         Between ''Peter Pan'' in 1924 and ''Dragnet'' in 1947 Ms. Brian appeared in 82 films. Petite, with blue-gray eyes and dark-brown curls, she was one of Hollywood's romantic leading ladies from the mid-1920's through the late 30's.         While she did not rank with superstars like Clara Bow or Mary Pickford, she was a bankable contract player and a gratifying attraction at the box office. Her leading men were the likes of Gary Cooper, Lew Ayres, James Cagney, Cary Grant, William Haines, Warner Oland and Dick Powell.         Among her films still shown at film festivals and on television are ''Peter Pan'' and one of the earliest western talkies, ''The Virginian,'' from 1929, with Cooper as the title character and Walter Huston as the villain.         In that film Ms. Brian portrayed Molly Wood, a schoolteacher who is the Virginian's romantic interest. In his review in The New York Times, Mordaunt Hall wrote that there was good humor in Medicine Bow when ''the lass from the East clashes with the lads from the West,'' adding that Ms. Brian helped the picture along, although ''she might have been more persuasive with less rouge on her lips.''         The review also said that ''the sounds, whether footfalls, horses' hoofs, rumbling wheels or voices, are really remarkably recorded and reproduced,'' and noted that movie depictions of life in the Wild West were ''aided immeasurably by the audibility of the screen.''         Ms. Brian was born Louise Byrdie Dantzler in Corsicana, Tex. After the family's move to Long Beach, Calif., she entered a beauty contest -- and though she did not win a prize, Paramount invited her to audition for a child's part in its film version of ''Peter Pan.''         The director, Herbert Brenon, cast the young Louise as Wendy. The studio gave her a new name, Mary Brian, and pared her age to 16, deeming 18 too grown up for the part. (After that, Ms. Brian kept her real age to herself, calling it ''negotiable.'')         She remained under contract to Paramount until 1932, appearing in more than 40 of its productions. She showed her mettle as juvenile lead or co-star in ''Beau Geste'' (1926), another Brenon film, and in ''Behind the Front'' (1926), ''Harold Teen'' (1926) and ''River of Romance'' (1929).         Easily navigating the changeover to sound, she appeared in two 1931 evergreens, George Cukor's ''Royal Family of Broadway'' and Lewis Milestone's ''Front Page.''         She played W. C. Fields's daughter in several films, including ''The Man on the Flying Trapeze'' (1935). Working with him she developed a knack for playing the straight woman in comedy, which came in handy later in her career.         Among her other movies of the 1930's were ''Shadows of Sing Sing,'' ''College Rhythm,'' ''Charlie Chan in Paris'' and ''Navy Blues.'' She appeared as herself in ''Hollywood on Parade No. 9'' (1933) and ''Star Night at the Cocoanut Grove'' (1934).         She took to the stage in vaudeville productions at the Palace Theater in New York in 1932 and toured in the 1940's with Edmund Lowe in a farce, ''Mary Had a Little . . .''         Ms. Brian said she gained a new perspective on life during World War II when she entertained troops, venturing closer to the front lines in Europe than most headliners. She spent Christmas 1944 with the soldiers fighting the Battle of the Bulge.         She ended her movie career after the war with ''Dragnet,'' but continued to make occasional television appearances.         In 1947 Ms. Brian married George Tomasini, a Hollywood film editor; he died in 1964.         She is survived by her godson, Stuart Erwin Jr., of Rancho Santa Fe, Calif.       
         Jean Kerr, whose wry wit and unerring eye for life's everyday absurdities kept legions of readers and theatergoers laughing with books like ''Please Don't Eat the Daisies'' and plays like ''Mary, Mary,'' died on Sunday in White Plains. She was 80.         The apparent cause was pneumonia, her son Christopher said. She was in White Plains Hospital and lived nearby in Larchmont, N.Y., also in Westchester County.         Mrs. Kerr, who was the widow of the drama critic Walter Kerr, was well acquainted with the glamour, grit and egocentric follies of life in the theater and capitalized on that experience. She wrote entertainingly and often about show business, musing about what to say when lunching with a prospective producer (order a drink, so you look relaxed, but don't touch it lest he think you're an alcoholic), or gloomily anticipating negative reviews of her latest work (''If I have to commit suicide, I have nothing but Gelusil'').         But she also had an unquestioned gift for finding the comic in the commonplace anxieties of suburbia and married life. She cheerfully acknowledged doing most of her writing in the family car, parked several blocks away from the scrambling chaos of several children and pets (''There is nothing to do but write, after I get the glove compartment tidied up'').         The Kerrs made their debut as a team on Broadway in 1946 with ''Song of Bernadette,'' a dramatization of Franz Werfel's novel about a young Frenchwoman who was canonized after saying she had seen visions of the Virgin Mary in a grotto near Lourdes. It was not a success, nor was her solo writing effort two years later, a comedy called ''Jenny Kissed Me,'' about a priest who finds his household disrupted by the arrival of his housekeeper's niece.         Jean and Walter Kerr teamed up again in 1949 with ''Touch and Go,'' a revue for which they wrote the sketches and lyrics and which Mr. Kerr directed. The show was a hit, with sketches ranging from ''Hamlet'' performed as a musical comedy to a location rehearsal for a film sequence in which one of the characters, a trained ape, turns out to be smarter than the glamorous actress who is the star of the film. Brooks Atkinson, writing in The New York Times,praised the Kerrs' ''breezy and informed wit'' and hailed the show as the best of the season.         After contributing some sketches to another revue, ''John Murray Anderson's Almanac,'' in 1953, Mrs. Kerr joined forces to write ''King of Hearts'' with Eleanor Brooke. Starring Donald Cooke, Jackie Cooper and Cloris Leachman, and staged by Mr. Kerr, the 1954 comedy about a comic-strip artist and his love-struck secretary was well received.         Mrs. Kerr scored her first big success outside the theater with the publication in 1957 of ''Please Don't Eat the Daisies,'' a witty and wide-ranging collection of pieces about everything from the pet dogs in her life to the oddities of the Kerrs' house in Larchmont, which boasted a two-story fireplace and a carillon that played the duet from ''Carmen.'' The book became a best seller and then a movie in 1960, with David Niven and Doris Day. It became a television situation comedy as well, and ran on NBC from 1965 to 1967.         The Kerrs returned to Broadway in 1958 with their musical comedy ''Goldilocks,'' staged by Mr. Kerr, with music by Leroy Anderson, lyrics by the Kerrs and Joan Ford, and choreography by Agnes de Mille. The show closed after a mercifully brief run, and the Kerrs made a mutual vow never to mention its name again.         Mrs. Kerr went on to take Broadway by storm in 1961 with ''Mary, Mary,'' a comedy about a divorced couple who seem headed for new and misguided relationships until they discover that they still love each other. Barbara Bel Geddes played the title character, Barry Nelson her stubbornly obtuse former spouse, with Betsy von Furstenberg and Michael Rennie as the handsome troublemakers. The Times's critic, Howard Taubman, gave the show a mixed review.         Nevertheless, audiences packed the theater nightly and ''Mary, Mary'' became one of the longest-running productions of the decade. Its 1963 screen adaptation, was directed by Mervyn LeRoy with Debbie Reynolds and Barry Nelson. Meanwhile, the original show was still on Broadway, with more than 1,500 performances in all.         Jean Collins Kerr was born in Scranton, Pa., on July 10, 1922. She attended Marywood Seminary and Marywood College in Scranton and acquired a taste for theater while still a student. She was serving as stage manager of a college production of ''Romeo and Juliet'' when she met Mr. Kerr, then a professor of drama at Catholic University in Washington. Shortly after earning her bachelor's degree at Marywood, she married and received a master's degree from Catholic University in 1945.         Her self-deprecating humor was amply evident in her other published work. She also wrote ''The Snake Has All the Lines'' (1960), ''Penny Candy'' (1970) and ''How I Got to Be Perfect'' (1978), collections of humorous essays.         Her family was a rich source of comic inspiration, a minefield of the unexpected that demanded resilience and a gift for improvisation. In addition to Christopher, who lives in Manhattan, Mrs. Kerr is survived by her sons Colin of Port Jefferson, N.Y., John of Portland, Me., Gregory of Coopersburg, Pa., and Gilbert of Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla.; her daughter, Kitty of Arlington, Mass.; her brothers Hugh Collins of Meriden, Conn., and Frank Collins of Ardmore, Pa., and 11 granchildren.         Mr. Kerr, whose long career embraced teaching, playwriting, directing and theater criticism -- first for The New York Herald Tribune and then for The Times -- died in 1996 at 83.         A tall, handsome woman with a ready smile, Mrs. Kerr never took herself too seriously. ''I'm not a natural playwright at all,'' she told an interviewer. ''I write what I know.'' There were those who felt she drew water from the same well too often. Phyllis Theroux, writing about ''How I Got to Be Perfect'' in The New York Times Sunday Book Review, noted that ''beneath her cleverness lies a sizable literary talent'' waiting to be aired.         Mrs. Kerr returned to the theater in 1964 with ''Poor Richard,'' a coolly reviewed romantic comedy.         Nearly 10 years passed before her next appearance on Broadway, with another romantic comedy, ''Finishing Touches'' (1973).         The 1980 comedy ''Lunch Hour'' turned out to be Mrs. Kerr's farewell to the theater. Set in the Hamptons and directed by Mike Nichols, the play starred Sam Waterston and Gilda Radner.         For all her experience and success in the theater, Mrs. Kerr never stopped worrying about how her work would be received.         She regarded opening night as ''a public hanging, and you're the hanged.'' She once said, ''I think if you can write a play or produce a play,'' the first step toward success has been made, if ''people don't want to kill themselves in the lobby.'' Then came the inimitable extra twist of Kerr: ''Now there must be four or five other steps, but that's the first.''       
         Nearly 50 years after the death of her son, Emmett Till, who was murdered and thrown into a river in Mississippi, Mamie Till Mobley died here today, still clinging to the hope for justice. She was 81.         The Rev. Jesse Jackson, speaking tonight at a news conference on behalf of the family inside her home, said Mrs. Mobley had been having dialysis about three times a week for some time and that she suffered cardiac arrest today. Family members said she was rushed to Jackson Park Hospital, where she died about 2:30 p.m.         After the killing of her 14-year-old son in 1955 in Money, Miss., Mrs. Mobley allowed his mutilated body to be displayed in an open coffin during his funeral service, where mourners recoiled at the sight of Emmett's wounds.         His death came to symbolize the brutality in the racist South and became a symbol of the civil rights movement. Emmett was killed for supposedly whistling at a white woman, an act that in the Jim Crow South could mean a lynching for a black man.         Mrs. Mobley became an outspoken champion for children in poor neighborhoods and spent more than half her life keeping alive the memory of Emmett and the hope of bringing his killers to justice. At the time of her death, she was writing a book, ''Death of Innocence,'' which is to be published this fall by Random House.         No one was ever convicted in her only son's death, a fact that drove Mrs. Mobley to speak out about racial injustice for more than four decades.         ''It was very difficult; that's what kept her living all 81 years,'' said Airickca Gordon, 33, a surrogate granddaughter, who was reared by Mrs. Mobley.         ''Her ultimate goal was to bring justice for what happened to her son. She was constantly speaking on it, trying to get the story out,'' Ms. Gordon said. ''She was yet doing activist work. She never stopped. That's what kept her going.''         Ms. Gordon said she would most remember Mrs. Mobley for her spirit.         ''Her will and her spirit,'' she said, calling her ''a strong-willed woman.''         In addition to writing the current book, with Chris Benson, a Chicago lawyer and author, on her son's case, Mrs. Mobley is also featured in a new documentary, ''The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till,'' by Keith Beauchamp.         Mr. Jackson praised Mrs. Mobley as a woman of strength who did not harbor hate and who used her son's death to transform the lives of others.         ''She was still consoling and still teaching,'' Mr. Jackson said.         ''What must be put into perspective is that we often say the modern Civil Rights movement began with Rosa Parks in Montgomery. That's really not accurate,'' Mr. Jackson said. He said Emmett's murder ''broke the emotional chains of Jim Crow.''         ''Mrs. Mobley did a profound strategic thing,'' Mr. Jackson added. ''With his body water-soaked and defaced, most people would have kept the casket covered. She let the body be exposed. More than 100,000 people saw his body lying in that casket here in Chicago. That must have been at that time the largest single civil rights demonstration in American history.''         After Emmett's death, Mrs. Mobley recently told The Times, ''at first, I just wanted to go in a hole and hide my face from the world.''         But she said she soon began to talk about her son's death and to sound the call for justice.         ''It gives me a chance to get out what is clogged up inside, because if I don't talk, it stays in and worries me,'' she said. ''If I can let it go, even though I cry sometimes, I have some relief.''         She believed that her son's dying ultimately was not in vain. And despite what was done to him, Mrs. Mobley said, ''I have not spent one minute hating.''         Services are pending.       
         Felice Marks Lippert, in whose kitchen Weight Watchers was hatched 40 years ago, died on Saturday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y.         The cause was lung cancer, her family said. Mrs. Lippert was 73 and lived on the East Side of Manhattan and in West Palm Beach, Fla.         Mrs. Lippert played a role in turning a budding business into an international phenomenon with millions of subscribers to its weight-control regimen. She helped develop the company's programs and was a director and vice president of Weight Watchers International until the H. J. Heinz Company acquired it in 1978. Heinz sold the business to a European investment company in 1999.         At the time of her death, Mrs. Lippert was chairwoman of the Weight Watchers Foundation, which promotes nutritional education. She also held the South African Weight Watchers franchise, which the Lipperts acquired in the mid-1990's.         The idea that eventually became Weight Watchers began in 1963, when Mrs. Lippert was living in Baldwin Harbor, N.Y., with her husband, Albert, and their two sons.         The couple had married a decade earlier and had settled into a routine that included weekly gatherings with friends for various activities; for example, they would hire an instructor to learn a new dance. By then the Lipperts had also realized they had a problem; they had put on weight.         Mrs. Lippert had heard about a woman in Queens, Jean Nidetch, who was teaching a diet program, and she asked Mrs. Nidetch to one of the weekly gatherings. A week later, following the nutritional regimen left by Mrs. Nidetch, Mrs. Lippert had lost four pounds and Mr. Lippert had lost seven. Eventually, they lost 100 points between them.         Realizing the potential, the Lipperts and Jean and Marty Nidetch huddled around the Lipperts' kitchen table for weeks to develop a strategy. They came up with the name and the concept of having people come to hear Jean Nidetch rather than her visiting their homes.         The two couples rented a space in Little Neck. Twenty-two people showed up at the first meeting, paying $2 each. Sixty-six showed up in a second space a week later in Baldwin. Within a year, Mr. Lippert began to sell franchises.         Jean Nidetch wrote ''Weight Watchers Program Cookbook,'' which sold millions of copies. Weight Watchers took off comparably.         Felice Lippert was born in the Bronx and graduated from Hunter College. She taught second grade in the New York public schools. She was on the boards of North Shore Hospital, the American Ireland Fund and the Cancer Research and Treatment Fund. She also supported the UJA-Federation of New York; St. Francis Hospital in Port Washington, N.Y.; and Hunter College.         Albert Lippert died in 1998. Mrs. Lippert is survived by two sons, Keith L., of Manhattan and Randy S., of Hellerup, Denmark; two sisters; two brothers; and four grandchildren.       
         Evelyn Trout, a pioneering aviator who flew in the first Powder Puff Derby and held many records, including becoming the first woman to fly all night, died on Jan. 24 in San Diego. She was 97.         Known as Bobbi for her bob hairstyle, she had an international pilot's license signed by Orville Wright in 1929 that was carried into space in 1995 by Eileen Collins, the first woman to be the pilot of an American spacecraft.         Miss Trout set many records for endurance and altitude; became the fifth woman to earn a transport license, allowing her to fly for hire; and was one of the first women to be a pilot for the Los Angeles Police Department.         In 1929, she was one of 19 participants in the first National Women's Air Derby, a California-to-Ohio race that Will Rogers famously called the ''first Powder Puff Derby.''         She had two hard landings on the trip. After the second, 70 miles short of Cleveland, she did her own repairs, using ''old tin and baling wire,'' according to a 1999 interview with The Los Angeles Times. When she reach Cleveland, officials scolded her for taking such a risk.         ''I told them, 'It got me here, didn't it?' '' she said. She was the last survivor of the famous race.         Her fame, like that of other early daredevils, was such that Walt Disney hired her in 1928 to publicize Mickey Mouse, not yet a famous character, by taking aloft a planeful of Mickey Mouse dolls.         Remembering the glories of her youth in an interview with The Los Angeles Daily News in 1999, Miss Trout said, ''People thought we were nuts.''         Miss Trout was born in Greenup, Ill., on Jan. 7, 1906, and spent much of her childhood moving with her family around the country, staying with relatives. Her early ambitions were to be a cowgirl or a motorcycle racer, but when she was 16, she had her first plane ride in a Curtiss Jenny and was captivated.         She was adept at mechanics, but administrators at her Los Angeles high school made her take home economics, which she told The Los Angeles Times was a ''sissy course.'' While still in high school, she persuaded her parents to buy a service station for her to run. Soon the station was so successful that her father quit his job with the phone company to help her run the business.         She said in an interview with The San Diego Union-Tribune that after high school she weighed the options of studying architecture in college or learning to fly. She decided to use her earnings from the service station for flying lessons.         The federal government gave her license number 2,613, meaning that just 2,612 pilots had been licensed before her. On Jan. 1, 1929, she received her international pilot's license, signed by Orville Wright, then chairman of the International Aeronautic Federation.         Miss Trout had a $35-a-week job demonstrating a new monoplane called the Golden Eagle, and she set her first record on Jan. 2, 1929, when she stayed aloft for 12 hours and 11 minutes to beat Viola Gentry's women's endurance record of eight hours. The New York Times reported that she carried concentrated food and a bottle of hot chocolate.         On Jan. 31, 1929, Elinor Smith beat Miss Trout's time by an hour. The battle was on. On Feb. 13, Miss Trout stayed up for 17 hours, 5 minutes to regain the record and become the first woman to fly all night. Miss Trout said in an interview with The New York Times that she had only lent the record to Miss Smith for a couple of weeks.         On June 16, 1929, Miss Trout climbed to 15,200 feet in a new 90-horsepower Golden Eagle Chief. This set an altitude record in light aircraft for women.         In November 1929, Miss Trout and Miss Smith joined forces to set an endurance record. They hoped to stay up for a month by refueling from a gas hose lowered by a refueling plane. They lasted 42 hours, 3 1/2 minutes, but that was a record.         On Jan. 1, 1931, Miss Trout and Edna May, another pilot, set another record by flying for more than 122 hours.         In the 1930's, Miss Trout was a flying instructor and commercial photographer. In World War II, she invented a machine to sort unused rivets that were being scrapped by aircraft companies and developed a device for smoothing the edges of machined metal. Also in the war, the Los Angeles Police Department hired her and four other women to do aerial surveillance.         Miss Trout was single, and no immediate family members survive. In her later years, she sold real estate and insurance and participated in events honoring the pioneers of aviation.         Correction:  February 6, 2003, Thursday  A picture caption on Sunday with an obituary of the pioneer aviator Evelyn Trout misidentified the plane shown with her. It was a Curtiss Pusher, not a Curtiss Robin.       
         Sylvia Regan Ellstein, who wrote a two-act comedy, ''The Fifth Season,'' a Broadway hit in 1953, died Jan. 18 in Manhattan. She was 94.         The play, by Sylvia Regan, as she was widely known, was a comedy about the dress trade. Brooks Atkinson, reviewing it in The New York Times, called it ''an entertaining piece of merchandise.''         Sylvia Hoffenberg was born in New York and attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.         As Sylvia Hoffman she began on the Broadway stage in 1926 as Anna, a Rumanian girl, in ''The Americans,'' a comedy about assimilating American ways. In the 1930's she was married to and divorced from James J. Regan, a lawyer, and did public relations work in theater.         ''Morning Star,'' a drama she wrote about immigrant family life on Manhattan's Lower East Side, opened on Broadway in 1940. It closed after 55 performances but has lived on in a Yiddish musical version and other productions.         In 1940 she married Abraham Ellstein. They contributed to a musical comedy, ''Great to be Alive!,'' which had its Broadway premiere in 1950.         Mr. Ellstein died in 1963. Her survivors include three brothers.       
         Cora Ginsburg, a prominent dealer in antique fabrics and clothing, died on Dec. 12 at her home in Tarrytown, N.Y. She was 92.         After World War II she worked with her husband, Benjamin Ginsburg, at Ginsburg & Levy, his family's antiques firm, at 815 Madison Ave., in Manhattan.         Its customers included the Metropolitan Museum of Art and notable collectors like Henry du Pont, John D. Rockefeller Jr., Electra Havemeyer Webb and Ima Hogg, who made purchases for themselves and for museums.         Mrs. Ginsburg was also a consultant and seller to Colonial Williamsburg, the Fashion Institute of Technology and other major institutions.         From about 1950 on, she was the buyer of textiles, needlework, ceramics, silver and brass for Ginsburg & Levy, which was dissolved in 1976. She did the same for her husband's successor firm, Benjamin Ginsburg Antiquary, until he retired in 1982.         She helped develop the field of costume in the worlds of antiques and museums, sharing her knowledge with a number of museums in the United States and elsewhere.         She opened a gallery, Cora Ginsburg, Inc., at 819 Madison Ave in 1982 and later moved it to 19 East 74th St. In 1997 Titi Halle became the owner of the gallery, which is now named Cora Ginsburg LLC. It sells antique costume, textiles and needlework from the 16 century through the 20th.         Cora Kling was born and grew up in the Bronx and attended Hunter College. She contributed valuable costumes and textiles to museums.         Her husband, whom she married in 1929, died in 1994.         She is survived by two sons, Henry, of London and Carl, of Frankfurt; a daughter, Deborah Ramsden of Woodstock, N.Y.; two grandchildren; and a sister, Elizabeth Trace of Peekskill, N.Y.       
         Noriko Sawada Bridges Flynn, a writer and civil rights worker who managed to transcend the struggle between management and labor in her personal and professional life, died on Feb. 7 at her home in Pescadero, Calif. She was 79.         Her first marriage, to Harry Bridges, the fiery Marxist leader of the West Coast longshoremen's union, required a change in legislation. After his death more than three decades later, she married Ed Flynn, president of a Pacific shippers association, who had long skirmished with Mr. Bridges across bargaining tables and picket lines.         For half a century, Ms. Flynn worked for union rights, fair treatment of immigrants and racial and sexual equality but was best known for her contrasting marriages.         Her first wedding, planned as an elopement, was initially thwarted by a Nevada law forbidding marriage between whites and Asians. She was the American-born daughter of Japanese immigrants, and Mr. Bridges was an immigrant from Australia. Friends said Ms. Flynn had a wicked sense of humor. She married Mr. Flynn, the shipping boss, on May Day, the international socialist holiday.         Ms. Flynn grew up on rented land near Los Angeles, where her parents grew fruit and vegetables. Beginning in 1942, when the government ordered the internment of Japanese-Americans on the West Coast, the family spent three years in a desert camp in Arizona. After the war, she moved to the San Francisco area, where for 12 years she was a secretary for Charles Garry, a lawyer whose clients included leading political dissidents and radicals. Mr. Garry introduced her to Mr. Bridges.         As Ms. Flynn described that first meeting to Robert Cherny, a history professor at San Francisco State University who is working on a biography of Mr. Bridges, her future husband was quite drunk. ''Where have you been?'' he mumbled. She replied, ''You mean, as in all your life?''         A relationship ensued and in December 1958, the couple drove to Reno for what they hoped would be a quiet and private wedding.         However, when Mr. Bridges, 58, and Ms. Sawada, 35, asked for a marriage license, the clerk explained that an 1846 law prohibited marriages between whites and Asians. Mr. Bridges protested, saying that his bride was an American, born in the United States, while he was the foreigner.         News accounts quoted the clerk as saying, ''It's not a matter of where you were born. It's the blood. It's against the law here.''         Mr. Bridges quickly took his case to the national press. Within four days lawyers for the couple succeeded in having the law struck down. The two obtained their license and were married in Reno.         For the next 32 years, until Mr. Bridges died in 1990, they were one of San Francisco's most prominent couples. She resumed the studies interrupted by her internment and wrote articles about her childhood for several national magazines. She was also at her husband's side in the 1970's when he stepped up his union's battle with the shippers for guarantees of job security.         In that bitter struggle, Mr. Bridges's major adversary was Ed Flynn, president of the Pacific Maritime Association. In 1971 a strike by Mr. Bridges's union shut down all 56 Pacific ports. But the two men liked and respected each other and understood each other's positions, Mr. Cherny said. He said they would battle in negotiations and then go out for dinner with their wives.         After they both retired, they continued to see each other. And after Harry Bridges's death, his widow kept in touch with his old opponent, who had become a widower. They married in 1994.         In addition to her husband, Ms. Flynn is survived by a daughter, Katherine Bridges Wiggins of Bandon, Ore., and two stepchildren, Robert Bridges of Fremont, Calif., and Marie Shell of San Francisco.       
         Baroness Liliane de Rothschild, the wife of Baron Elie de Rothschild, an art collector, philanthropist and meticulous caretaker of the history of the family she married into, died on Feb. 17 in her home in Royaumont, outside Paris. She was 86.         Her husband, a member of the French branch of the Rothschilds, was a skilled polo player and is reputedly the family's foremost wine connoisseur and a widely knowledgeable collector of art. But as much as the baron exemplifies the family's grand style, he once said his wife was the family member most steeped in family history, tradition and élan.         In Derek Wilson's book ''Rothschild: the Wealth and Power of a Dynasty,'' the baron said his wife was more Rothschild than the Rothschilds.         Liliane Fould-Springer was born on May 11, 1916. She was part of a rival French financial family, a great-niece of Achille Fould, the rival of James Rothschild in the mid-19th century. Mr. Fould's financial house, Crédit Mobilier, had threatened to smash the Rothschild supremacy, but in the end lost out to the family.         The Rothschilds were childhood sweethearts and became engaged before World War II. Baron Elie and his brother, Alain, were serving at the front when Germany overran France in 1940. Both were captured and ended up in Colditz Castle, the Germans' most secure prison, after separate escape attempts.         Baron Elie wrote to Miss Fould-Springer and proposed that they marry by proxy. Her parents were opposed to the idea, pointing out that it was not helpful to bear the name Rothschild with the Gestapo swarming over France.         But Liliane agreed. Wedding ceremonies took place many months apart, with Baron Elie giving his pledge at Colditz on Oct. 7, 1941, and Miss Fould-Springer giving hers at Cannes on April 7, 1942.         After the war, her husband ran Chateau Lafite, one of the family vineyards. Chateau Mouton, long owned by Philippe de Rothschild, is equally famous. The vineyards have been rivals since 1855, ever since Lafite was classified as premier cru, or first category, and Mouton as only second. Mouton achieved the long-sought first category in 1973.         The vineyard rivalry sometimes approached bitterness. But when Philippe's daughter, Philippine, was to be married in 1961, Liliane de Rothschild fulfilled her frequent role of unifying the family. In the face of Philippe's heated campaign to burnish Mouton's allure, Baroness de Rothschild staged the wedding in the vaulted cellars of Lafite.         ''Here all lifted glasses to the bride, to groom, to both Rothschild vineyards, and to Liliane, the hostess,'' Frederic Morton wrote in ''The Rothschilds: A Family Portrait.''         Baroness de Rothschild was a frequent presence in the world of haute couture. The designer Balenciaga made a doll for her, depicting one of her daughters at the age of 9.         She was also important in the art world, particularly as a recognized expert on 18th-century art. Part of her role, according to the Morton book, was organizing the vast art purchases her husband made.         But sometimes she made her own purchases. The New York Times in 1999 reported her vigorous bidding on several items, including a German clock case from around 1550, that another branch of the Rothschilds was auctioning off. She paid $148,105 for items expected to sell for $16,000 at most.         Her social circle included the expected royalty and celebrities, like her friend Greta Garbo, whom she called ''the loveliest woman you or I ever saw or will see,'' but she preferred that they be interesting people.         The baroness is survived by her husband; two daughters, Nellie Munthe of London and Elisabeth of Paris; a son, Nathaniel of New York City; five grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.         She was famed for both her worldly wit and her great composure. Christopher Ogden, in his book ''Life of the Party: The Biography of Pamela Digby Churchill Hayward Harriman,'' told of the evening in 1954, when the baroness was seated at a dinner next to the Duke of Windsor.         He turned to her and asked, ''Which Rothschild is the lover of Pamela Churchill?''         ''My husband, sir,'' the baroness replied.       
         Laura Rothenberg, who recorded an audio diary for National Public Radio that documented her daily life as she struggled with cystic fibrosis, died Thursday night at her apartment in Manhattan. She was 22.         The cause was chronic rejection of a lung transplant, complicated by infection, said her father, Jon.         Many people with cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease that causes mucus to build up in the organs, mainly in the lungs and pancreas, die in young adulthood. Ms. Rothenberg, a junior majoring in English at Brown University liked to say that she had already had her midlife crisis.         Her audio diary, ''My So-Called Lungs,'' recorded over two years, was broadcast on N.P.R.'s ''All Things Considered'' in August 2002 as part of a continuing documentary series called ''Radio Diaries.'' In her recordings, she describes her decision to undergo a lung transplant in July 2001 and the many health problems that followed -- pneumonia, lymphoma, diabetes, a broken hip.         She also talks about a surprise ''lung retirement party'' given by her friends before she left Brown for her transplant surgery. One friend designed a poster that read, ''Thank you to the lungs of Laura for 20 years of exemplary service.''         While attending Chapin School in Manhattan as a teenager, Ms. Rothenberg got her classmates interested in raising money for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation through its annual Great Strides Walk, her father said. Her family said she recently set up a fund that will raise money for a bronchoscopy suite at Children's Hospital Boston, where she had her transplant.         She went through many bronchoscopies, either to check for possible rejection or infection or to open up her airways, her father said, and scheduling the procedures was often tricky because space had to be found in an operating room.         Ms. Rothenberg wrote a memoir, ''Breathing for a Living,'' that will be published by Hyperion in July.         She is survived by her parents, Jon and Mary, and her partner, Bryan Doerries.         When Ms. Rothenberg was getting ready to go back to school last summer, about a year after her surgery, she talked in the diary about her goals: ''You know, I want to walk from my door to the Main Green, maybe even play soccer, which I haven't done for like eight years. But I don't really count on anything anymore. I just go with the flow. I think that's O.K.''       
         Peggy Conklin, a stage actress who found early success in ''The Petrified Forest'' in 1936 and followed it with a wide variety of dramatic and comic roles on Broadway, died last Tuesday at her home in Naples, Fla. She was 96.         Ms. Conklin had leading or featured roles from the 1930's through the 1950's. She made a brief detour to Hollywood in 1934, making five films in a few years, then returning to New York.         She was Gabby Maple, the filling-station waitress, in Robert Sherwood's ''Petrified Forest.'' The drama featured Humphrey Bogart as the desperate killer Duke Mantee, a role that would help make him a star. Ms. Conklin also appeared with Helen Hayes in ''The Wisteria Tree,'' Joshua Logan's 1950 adaptation of Chekhov's ''Cherry Orchard.'' She was Janice Rule's anxious mother in William Inge's ''Picnic'' (1953), which also starred Ralph Meeker, Eileen Heckart, Kim Stanley and Paul Newman.         In 1941 she originated a role on Broadway that was to remain popular for decades on radio and television: Pam North, the amiably ditzy wife of Jerry North in Owen Davis's 1941 adaptation of Richard Lockridge's detective story ''Mr. and Mrs. North.'' Playing opposite Albert Hackett, the urbane New York couple stumble into a murder mystery: a corpse in their closet.         ''Peggy Conklin's charm keeps Mrs. North's informality from being the annoyance it probably is,'' the theater critic Brooks Atkinson wrote in The New York Times.         Peggy Conklin was born on Nov. 2, 1902, in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. She spoke little of her childhood, her son, Michael Thompson, said yesterday, except to say that it had been marked by poverty and her father's absence. Her mother died when Miss Conklin was 12, he said, and she was left in the care of two aunts. After graduating from high school, she left for New York to pursue an acting career.         Ms. Conklin married James D. Thompson, an advertising executive, in 1935. He died in 1998. Besides her son, of Redwood City, Calif., she is survived by a daughter, Antonia West, of Stroud, Gloucestershire, England, and three grandchildren.         Although she continued to act after her marriage, the demands of family life proved distracting. ''In later years,'' her son said, ''she would look back and say, 'Gosh, I wonder if I could have had a career like Helen Hayes or Mary Martin.' ''         Correction:  March 27, 2003, Thursday  An obituary of the actress Peggy Conklin on Tuesday misstated her birth year. It was 1906, not 1902.       
         Anne Logan Davis Wichern, a lung specialist at Bellevue Hospital Center and professor emeritus at New York University who established one of the country's first emphysema clinics, died March 9. She was 78 and lived on the Upper East Side.         The cause was cancer, her family said, and she died at the Columbia-Presbyterian Center of New York-Presbyterian Hospital.         Dr. Davis, as she was known professionally, was a pioneer in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. She founded the emphysema unit at Bellevue in 1956 and remained its director until two years ago, when it was merged into the hospital's chest and asthma units.         She was associated with Bellevue since she started her internship there in 1949. An authority in pulmonary critical care, she formally retired in December as an attending physician at the hospital.         She directed the Bellevue chest clinic from 1987 to 1992, overseeing some 6,000 patient visits every year. Through the 1970's and 1980's, she also was a physician and consultant at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Manhattan.         She started her academic career as an instructor at the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1957, rising to assistant professor of medicine in 1968. That year, she accepted an associate professorship with permanent tenure at the New York University School of Medicine, from which she retired in December.         Anne Logan Davis was born in Rahway, N.J., and graduated from Wellesley College in 1945 and received her medical degree at Columbia in 1949. She decided to specialize in chest and pediatric pulmonary medicine while a resident at Bellevue in the 1950's, after recovering from tuberculosis contracted during her internship.         From experience, she found that in a busy municipal hospital the special needs of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary illnesses tended to receive short shrift. She was given the opportunity to organize the emphysema clinic to deal comprehensively with the patients' medical, social and economic conditions, and to undertake a systematic study and record of their progress.         Dr. Davis is survived by her husband of 47 years, Dr. Walter Adam Wichern Jr., chairman emeritus of surgery at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center; a son, Walter A. III, and a daughter, A. Logan Wichern, both of Manhattan; and a sister, Carol Goodman of Morristown, N.J.       
         Frankie Hewitt, who spearheaded the revival of Ford's Theater here and turned it into a showplace for plays and musicals, died Friday at her home in Kensington, Md. She was 71.         The cause was cancer, Ford's Theater announced.         Just one day earlier, President Bush had awarded her the National Humanities Medal, one of numerous honors she had won for turning a historical landmark into an important place to learn and enjoy American history and culture.         Mrs. Hewitt got involved with Ford's Theater in the 1960's when plans were being drawn up to renovate it. It had been used mostly as a government warehouse for a century after Abraham Lincoln's assassination in April 1865.         A friend, Stewart L. Udall, then the secretary of the interior, described a plan to turn the building on 10th Street NW into a museum with a light and sound show. Mrs. Hewitt, who was then married to Don Hewitt, producer of ''60 Minutes'' on CBS, argued that it should be more than a testament to the awful historical episode and should make an active contribution to cultural life.         She went to work, negotiating an agreement for the theater to operate as a national historic site and museum. It reopened on Feb. 12, 1968, with a production of Stephen Vincent Benét's ''John Brown's Body.''         When initial shows at Ford's did not draw big audiences, Mrs. Hewitt began to book shows herself. Although she had no theater background, she founded the nonprofit Ford's Theater Society and later produced more than 150 stage shows.         She also was executive producer of more than 15 network television specials broadcast from Ford's Theater. Through a series of televised galas Mrs. Hewitt drew national attention to Ford's and raised money.         Mrs. Hewitt was born Frankie Teague in Oklahoma's Dust Bowl and migrated at the age of 8 with her impoverished family to California. After stints in journalism and public relations, she moved to Washington in 1956. She then served as the staff director of a Senate subcommittee, followed by a job as public affairs adviser to Adlai Stevenson, then ambassador to the United Nations.         She is survived by her daughters, Jilian Childers Hewitt, from her first marriage, to Bob Childers, and Lisa Hewitt Cassara, from her marriage to Mr. Hewitt, which ended in divorce in 1974. She also is survived by two grandsons, two stepsons, three grandchildren and a sister.       
         Elaine Barrie, the fourth wife of the Shakespearean actor John Barrymore, with whom she shared a tumultuous on-again, off-again engagement and marriage that enthralled the nation in the darkest days of the Depression, died on Saturday in Manhattan. She was 87.         Her story unwinds like an old-fashioned movie. As a Hunter College student of 19, she wrote an adoring letter to Barrymore, then 53 and hospitalized in Manhattan. He phoned her, they had a pleasant talk and he invited her to visit him. There was a most meaningful kiss in his hospital room.         They almost immediately became known to the public by the Shakespearean names they had bestowed on each other, Ariel and Caliban, from ''The Tempest.'' There was a mysterious voyage on Barrymore's yacht, a cross-country chase (with her pursuing him), an elopement and tender reconciliations after spectacular quarrels.         But there were darker elements to the tale. Barrymore, one of the leading interpreters of Shakespeare in the 20th century, was in decline because of the ravages of alcoholism, reduced to reading his lines. Many speculated that the young woman was using him to help her own nascent acting career.         The saga at times seemed to sink to slapstick. When Barrymore got his bride a role in a 1940 play, ''My Dear Children,'' the most photographed, talked-about scene occurred when he held her in his lap and spanked her. And the best-remembered of her few films was undoubtedly the saucy short ''How to Undress in Front of Your Husband,'' released in 1937 and still available for sale.         Elaine Jacobs, the daughter of a traveling salesman, was born on July 16, 1915. She first saw Barrymore in the 1931 film ''Svengali'' and vowed to marry him, a friend, Linda Herman, recounted. At 16 she won a walk-on part with a stock company that turned into a talking role. She wrote and directed plays at Hunter College.         Even before she married, Miss Jacobs changed her name to Barrie because it sounded like Barrymore. She used Barrymore during her marriage.         She wrote a series of articles about her romance for The New York Mirror in 1935. In the first installment she told of reading that Barrymore's marriage to the actress Dolores Costello was on the rocks and of ''turning faint with exultation.''         In her fateful letter, dated March 3, 1935, she told Barrymore he could ''make a dream of mine come true!'' She followed up with a phone call.         Sandford Dody, who helped Miss Barrie write her autobiography, ''All My Sins Remembered'' (Appleton-Century, 1964), suggested that Barrymore had found her a breezy change of pace.         ''It was easy to see why the aging actor, sick in a hospital and sated with strawberry blondes of Hollywood who were as bland as Wonder Bread, found this bright and wry little New York girl, with all her crust, a tasty morsel,'' he wrote in his own autobiography, ''Giving Up the Ghost: A Writer's Life Among the Stars'' (M. Evans, 1980).         It was an uneasy courtship, with one argument leading to Barrymore's seizing the diamond ring he had given her and saying that he would return it only if she did not call it an engagement ring.         The marriage, celebrated a few minutes after midnight on Nov. 9, 1936, in Yuma, Ariz., was hardly smooth sailing, either. There were at least four public separations, including one legal divorce that they agreed to reverse. The first tiff, in which Mrs. Barrymore said her husband ''roughed me up a bit,'' came 57 days after their wedding, on New Year's Eve. The final divorce was on Nov. 27, 1940.         The Barrymore family -- which traces its acting tradition to 1752 and is today most famously represented by Drew, the granddaughter of John Barrymore and Miss Costello -- treated Miss Barrie as a pariah. She was the first of John's four wives to use the Barrymore name professionally, and the first Barrymore to undress onstage.         Miss Barrie appeared in radio, plays and movies at the behest of her husband, but she is credited with only one full-length film, ''Midnight,'' a 1939 movie starring Claudette Colbert. After the divorce she remained part of the Hollywood scene and dated Errol Flynn and Ray Milland, among others.         She later ran a business importing straw baskets and handbags from Haiti. Last year she sold at auction a silver pillbox once owned by her friend Marilyn Monroe. To help Christopher Plummer prepare for a one-man show on John Barrymore on Broadway in 1997 she showed him Barrymore's love letters.         Miss Barrie was the only former wife to attend Barrymore's funeral in 1942. She never remarried and has no immediate survivors. In 1957 she told The New York Herald Tribune that marrying anybody else would have been ''anticlimactic.''       
         Nadine Conner, who sang on the radio with Bing Crosby and Gordon MacRae before a lengthy career as a lyric soprano at the Metropolitan Opera, died March 1 in Los Alamitos, Calif. She was 96.         She made her New York debut on Dec. 22, 1941, as Pamina in an English version of Mozart's ''Magic Flute,'' conducted by Bruno Walter. She was hailed for both her vocal promise and her youthful beauty. It was not generally known that she was then about 35.         After singing the role of the Forest Bird in ''Siegfried,'' she went on to demanding roles in 1943, singing the first of 25 Sophies in ''Der Rosenkavalier.''         She also sang with the New York Philharmonic beginning in 1942, when she took a solo part in Mahler's Second Symphony, under Walter, who then chose her for annual performances of the Bach ''St. Matthew Passion.''         Among her outstanding recordings was one of ''Hansel and Gretel'' in 1947, in which she and Risë Stevens sang the title roles. It was the first complete opera recording made in this country, according to the Met archivists.         In 1951, also under Walter, she sang Marzelline in ''Fidelio,'' in which her voice had to stand up to the heroic sounds of Kirsten Flagstad.         She progressed to a memorable Tyrone Guthrie production of ''Carmen'' in 1951 and 1952, and sang Mimi in a new production of ''La Bohème'' as well.         Altogether she gave 249 performances of 15 roles before her last Met performance, in ''Faust,'' on March 12, 1960.         The New York Times said her final performance made ''an appealing Marguerite'' that showed her vocally in admirable form. ''Her farewell performance,'' wrote John Briggs, ''was one of the best of her Metropolitan career.''         She was born Evelyn Nadine Henderson into a large, artistic family in Compton, Calif., and studied piano and drama as a child. In high school she studied voice on the side, and she soon decided that her voice belonged in the lighter lyric repertory rather than in roles like Puccini's ''Tosca'' or ''Madame Butterfly.''         She found a niche in radio, singing with orchestras in national broadcasts. She got the attention of talent scouts and, finally, the invitation to audition at the Metropolitan.         While studying music at the University of California in Los Angeles, she was briefly married to a classmate, whose name she kept for the stage.         She was married again, in 1939, to Laurance Heacock, a surgeon, with whom she returned to Southern California in 1970.         They settled in Cypress, where she taught singing.         Dr. Heacock died in 1987. She is survived by a daughter, Sue Lynn Hawkins of Irvine, Calif.; a son, Loren Heacock of Fountain Valley, Calif.; four grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.       
         Amanda Davis, a promising writer whose first novel appeared in bookstores on Feb. 18, died on Friday when the small plane that was taking her on a publicity tour crashed into a mountain 18 miles from Asheville, N.C. She was 32 and lived in Oakland, Calif.         Her father, Dr. James Davis, who was piloting the plane, a Cessna 177 Cardinal, and her mother, Francie Davis, both of Setauket, N.Y., were also killed.         Her novel, ''Wonder When You'll Miss Me,'' was published by William Morrow. In its first-person narrative a young woman, Faith Duckle, makes a difficult journey from schoolyard outcast to trapeze artist in a circus. Ms. Davis traveled with a circus to do research for the book.         Her other writings include ''Circling the Drain'' (1999, Morrow/Avon), a collection of 15 short stories, mostly concerning young women dealing with loss.         When she died, she was an assistant professor at Mills College, in Oakland, where she taught fiction-writing to undergraduates and graduate students. She received a bachelor's degree in theater from Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn., and a master's degree in fiction from Brooklyn College.         Her father, who was 63, was chairman of the neurology department at Stony Brook University Medical School in Stony Brook, N.Y. Her mother, 59, was an assistant professor and the chief librarian at Dowling College in Oakdale, N.Y.         Ms. Davis was born in Durham, N.C., her family's longtime hometown.         She is survived by a sister, Joanna Maure Davis, of San Francisco, and a brother, Adam, of Lancaster, Pa.       
         Judy V. Wilson, long a successful publisher of children's books, most recently at Orchard Books, an imprint of Scholastic Inc., died in Manhattan on Friday. She was 63 and lived in Brooklyn.         The cause was cancer, said Deborah Hochman Turvey, a family friend.         Mrs. Wilson was the president and general manager of the Macmillan Publishing Co. Children's Book Group from 1988 to 1994. Under her leadership, the book group's distinguished children's hardcover imprints -- Macmillan, the Bradbury Press, Margaret K. McElderry Books, Atheneum, Four Winds Press and Scribner's and two paperback lines, Aladdin and Collier -- were integrated into one profitable organization with shared service departments, an innovation for the time. Revenues tripled, and the group was cited by The Wall Street Journal as ''the jewel of Macmillan's assets.'' It was sold in 1993 as a unit to Paramount Inc., then the parent of Simon & Schuster, and most of the imprints were eliminated.         In 1996 after Orchard's editorial and marketing staff left to start another company, Mrs. Wilson re-established the Orchard Books imprint, diversified it and led it through its acquisition by Scholastic Inc. She retired in 2001.         Mrs. Wilson was born in Old Hickory, Tenn., raised in Iowa and Virginia and graduated from Smith College in 1961 with a degree in philosophy and English. She began her career as a project manager for the Encyclopedia Britannica. From 1965 to 1985 she was a publisher within the professional group of John Wiley & Sons Inc. first developing the Self-Teaching Guide series, then computer books for Atari and Radio Shack, selling books to computer manufacturers for packing with personal computers. She established the Wiley Press, a trade paperback line, and Wiley Professional Software.         She is survived by her husband, Robert Wilson; her son, Rob; and her daughter, Hilary.       
         Rose Augustine, a former chemistry teacher who with her husband revolutionized the world of the classical guitar by developing the nylon guitar string and who commissioned new works and underwrote concert series and competitions, died on April 21 in Manhattan. She was 93 and lived in Manhattan.         Trained as a pianist and passionate about the harpsichord, Mrs. Augustine often said that she did not much care for the guitar and its repertory. Yet anyone who has regularly attended guitar recitals in New York has probably encountered her: she was as likely to be seen at a debut as at a concert by a famous player, and chances are she helped pay for the concert.         The Spanish guitarist Andrés Segovia lived with Mrs. Augustine and her husband, Albert, for 11 years, starting in the late 1940's. Julian Bream, the greatest guitarist of the post-Segovia generation, never stopped in New York without visiting her Greenwich Village town house and leaving with a year's worth of Augustine Imperial guitar strings. And when she spotted young players who she felt were carrying on the Segovia tradition, she threw her influence behind their careers.         Mrs. Augustine was born in the Bronx in 1910 and earned a bachelor's degree at Hunter Colleger and a master's at Columbia University. She became a high school science teacher but went into the string business after World War II when her husband, a guitar maker, found that the gut strings traditionally used for the guitar's three treble strings were in short supply.         Mr. Augustine began experimenting with fishing line and eventually got in touch with an engineer at DuPont, who was skeptical about the filament's musical utility. The first samples were said to have had a metallic sound. But when Segovia commissioned a guitar from Mr. Augustine in 1946, he also expressed interest in nylon strings. The Augustines found a grinding machine, originally meant to make binoculars, at a war surplus store on Canal Street and reconfigured it to grind nylon guitar strings to the right thickness and consistency.         Segovia quickly became a champion of the new strings, which lasted longer and could be kept in tune more reliably than the strings guitarists had used for centuries. His use of the strings created a demand among both amateur and professional guitarists, and the Augustines began selling them in packages adorned with Segovia's picture and an endorsement over his signature. Other companies began using nylon as well, and it quickly supplanted gut as the standard for classical guitar treble strings.         Mrs. Augustine kept her teaching job during the early years of the family company, Albert Augustine Ltd., but worked nights filling orders. After her husband died in 1967, she took over the company, regularly updated its manufacturing processes and established a thriving market for her strings around the world.         During the 1980's Mrs. Augustine, who has no immediate survivors, began underwriting concerts, paying for series at the 92nd Street Y and at the Manhattan School of Music as well as festivals and competitions throughout the United States and in Europe. She also commissioned guitar works from about 20 composers.       
         Nina Simone, a singer whose distinctively emotional style blended elements of jazz, gospel, blues, European art song and other influences, died yesterday at her home in Carry-le-Rouet, France, near Marseille. She was 70.         Her manager, Clifton Henderson, said she had been ill for some time, but he released no cause of death.         Ms. Simone had only one Top 20 hit in her long career -- her very first single, ''I Loves You, Porgy,'' released in 1959 -- but her following was large and loyal and her impact deep and lasting. Aretha Franklin, Roberta Flack and Laura Nyro were among the singers who were influenced by her. In recent years her songs resurfaced and won new fans on television commercials and in dance-club remixes.         Although she was most often characterized as a jazz singer, Ms. Simone, who usually performed with a rhythm section and always accompanied herself on piano, was almost impossible to classify.         ''If I had to be called something,'' she wrote in 1991 in her autobiography, ''I Put a Spell on You,'' ''it should have been a folk singer because there was more folk and blues than jazz in my playing.''         But her piano playing also revealed her classical training more clearly than most jazz pianists', and her singing -- at times rough and raw, at other times sweet and pure -- owed an unmistakable debt to black gospel music. Her repertory was similarly eclectic: it ranged from blues to Broadway, from Jacques Brel to Screamin' Jay Hawkins to the Bee Gees.         Ms. Simone was as famous for her social consciousness as she was for her music. In the 1960's no musical performer was more closely identified with the civil rights movement. Though she was best known as an interpreter of other people's music, she eloquently expressed her feelings about racism and black pride in those years in a number of memorable songs she wrote herself.         ''Mississippi Goddam'' was an angry response to the killing of the civil rights advocate Medgar Evers. ''Young, Gifted and Black,'' written with the keyboardist Weldon Irvine Jr., became something of an anthem, recorded by Aretha Franklin and many others. ''Four Women'' painted a subtle but stinging picture of the suffering and the strength of African-American women.         She was born Eunice Waymon on Feb. 21, 1933, in Tryon, N.C., and grew up singing in a church choir and studying piano. She received a scholarship to the Juilliard School of Music in 1950, although she had to work as an accompanist for singers and as a piano teacher to help support herself. She eventually ran out of money, left Juilliard and moved back in with her family, at that time living in Philadelphia.         In 1954 she got a job playing piano at a bar and grill in Atlantic City, where she assumed her stage name -- because, she later explained, she did not want her mother to find out what she was doing. After her first night on the job, she was told that she had to sing as well as play, so she began emulating Billie Holiday and other singers she admired. She later said that she kept herself from getting frustrated with the often indifferent crowds by playing the piano in a manner ''as close to classical music as possible.'' This unusual mixture of approaches produced what the music writer Ashley Kahn has called ''an impassioned, impromptu approach that became her signature.''         Ms. Simone soon began to work in better venues and develop a devoted following. In 1958 she signed with Bethlehem Records; a few months later, she was on the pop charts. One of her best-remembered hits was ''My Baby Just Cares for Me.''         Her subsequent recordings for the Colpix, Philips and RCA Victor labels established her as a potent attraction on the cabaret, concert and festival circuits. Unafraid to speak her mind, she frequently clashed with promoters and occasionally berated her audiences for not paying attention, but her temperament did nothing to diminish her appeal.         Her survivors include three brothers, a sister and a daughter, Lisa, a singer and actress known professionally as Simone who is currently appearing on Broadway in ''Aida.''         In the 1970's her music fell out of fashion in the United States; she divorced her husband and manager, Andy Stroud, and beset by financial problems she left the country in 1973, living in Liberia and Barbados before settling in France. In a 1998 interview, she said she had left the United States because of a racial situation she called ''worse than ever.''         In recent years, as her health began to fail, Ms. Simone performed less and less, although she continued to draw enthusiastic crowds wherever she appeared. Al Schackman, who played guitar in her backup group for four decades, said she had recently canceled a tour of Britain but had been planning a United States tour for this spring.       
         Ella King Torrey, former president of the San Francisco Art Institute and an innovative arts administrator, died Wednesday at her home in San Francisco. She was 45.         Her family did not disclose the cause of death.         Ms. Torrey, who was called by both her first and middle names, and was the fifth-generation Ella King in her family, was inspired most of her life by the importance of individual artists and grass-roots artistic collaborations. She pursued this interest in several ways, from organizing exhibitions and writing to frequently participating on panels for the National Endowment for the Arts.         ''Her whole focus was creating opportunities for artists,'' said John Killacky, an officer at the San Francisco Foundation. ''In every situation, she was an animator, a cultural animator.''         Ms. Torrey was born in 1957 in Bronxville, N.Y., and grew up in Evansville, Ind., and Philadelphia. She graduated cum laude in 1980 from Yale University, where she majored in art history and wrote her senior essay on the effect of Barbie dolls on popular culture. Her interest in contemporary folk art took her to the University of Mississippi, where she wrote her master's thesis on Theora Hamblett, a little-known visionary folk painter, and became deeply involved with black quilt-makers. She was charter president of Afro-American Quilters Inc., a nonprofit cooperative in Oxford, Miss.         In 1985, she became a program officer at the Pew Charitable Trusts in Philadelphia, where her projects included rehabilitating buildings for artists' subsidized housing. Pushing the Pew to support individual artists as well as institutions, she founded and headed the Pew Artists Fellowship Program, which awards 12 $50,000 grants to artists annually.         Ms. Torrey became president of the San Francisco Art Institute in 1995, when it was in physical and financial disarray. Widely credited with raising this art school's national and international profile, she more than tripled its endowment, oversaw the renovation and expansion of its landmark building, added several new trustees, re-established its visiting artists' program and also established an exchange program with Oxford University.         In early 2001, an auditing firm found irregularities in the way the institute's chief financial officer and comptroller had been keeping its books. In April 2002, Ms. Torrey resigned. ''I felt I had accomplished much of what I set out to do,'' she told The San Francisco Chronicle. Several board members then resigned in protest.         Ms. Torrey is survived by her mother, Ella Russell Torrey of Philadelphia; a sister, Elizabeth L. Torrey of Washington; and a brother, L. Russell Torrey of Villanova, Pa.         Correction:  May 17, 2003, Saturday  An obituary on May 3 about Ella King Torrey, a former president of the San Francisco Art Institute, misstated its fiscal situation in 1995, when she took the post. While the institute had often run a deficit, sometimes amounting to half its annual budget, it had begun to reduce deficits since the mid-1980's and to address many of its structural problems. It was not in financial or physical disarray.       
         Celine G. Marcus, former executive director of the Lenox Hill Neighborhood Association, an East Side social services organization, died on Thursday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 93.         She retired in 1982 after 12 years as the association's executive director and 11 years as assistant to the director.         She spent those 23 years helping to create a network of social services in the association's neighborhood, from 59th to 96th Streets and Fifth Avenue to the East River.         She became the head of a staff of 255, 180 of them volunteers, and addressed problems including crime, truancy, loneliness and aging. The organization is now called the Lenox Hill Neighborhood House.         In 1980, she was a founder of the Neighborhood Coalition for Shelter, which works to provide shelter and other help for Manhattan's homeless.         She was on the boards of the Yorkville Civic Center and several other groups.         In 1983 she was one of the first five winners of the Family of New York Awards, fostered by former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.         She and her co-winners were honored for helping to establish a community shelter for homeless women. They also led efforts to aid homeless men at a city-run shelter in the Seventh Regiment Armory, at Park Avenue and 66th Street.         Born in Brooklyn, Celine Greenebaum graduated from Barnard. Her social-services career began on the Lower East Side in the Depression and lasted more than 50 years.         Her husband, Joshua Marcus, died in 1988. She is survived by two daughters, Ann Marcus of Manhattan and Dorothy Marcus of the Bronx; a son, Daniel, of Washington; five grandchildren; six great-grandchildren; and two sisters, Marion Epstein of Princeton, N.J., and Helen Joffe of Rochester.       
         The performer who used the stage name Pepper LaBeija as a glamorous queen of the Harlem drag balls immortalized in the 1991 documentary ''Paris Is Burning'' died on May 14 at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She, as she preferred to be called, was 53.         A woman who answered the telephone at her mother's home but who would not identify herself said the cause of death was a heart attack.         Miss LaBeija (pronounced la-BAY-zha) appeared proudly in luxuriant female garb that was often golden and shimmering, and referred to herself in feminine terms, her friend Marcel Christian LaBeija said.         Marcel's given name is Herman Williams, but the last name of LaBeija is used by all members of the House of LaBeija, the group of performers Pepper led.         When Pepper LaBeija was not onstage, she was William Jackson of the Bronx, who sometimes dressed as a man.         Pepper was the last of the four great queens of the modern Harlem balls; Angie Xtravaganza, Dorian Corey and Avis Pendavis all died in recent years. These four exuded a sort of wild expressionism that might make Las Vegas showgirls seem tame.         ''This is the end of the golden age,'' said Brian Lantelme, a photographer who has covered the balls.         The House of LaBeija was one of the first houses, founded in 1970. The female impersonator who first led it thought the name LaBeija seemed glamorous. Pepper took over in 1971 or 1972, Marcel said.         Pepper LaBeija was called ''mother''; the house's younger members were the ''children.''         ''A house is a family for those who don't have a family,'' Miss LaBeija said in the movie.         Marcel LaBeija and Mr. Lantelme said that Pepper was also survived by a son and daughter, but did not know these survivors' names.         Miss LaBeija had diabetes, which had led to the amputation of both feet, and had been bedridden for most of the last decade. She last performed at a ball in 2001, when 30 attendants delivered her on a litter to the crowd's jubilation.         ''Her specialty was the Egyptian effect,'' Marcel LaBeija said.         Pepper LaBeija was a legend to the members and patrons of the Harlem ball scene, a world of extravagant make-believe that crosses sexual boundaries and that was chronicled in ''Paris Is Burning,'' directed by Jennie Livingston. In an interview, Ms. Livingston spoke of Pepper's ''glamorous bravado'' that stood out in a flock of Marilyn Monroes.         The public also glimpsed the ball scene in a Madonna video that featured voguing, a highly stylized and posed dance form used in the balls. Voguing was also featured at the Love Balls, which were held at Roseland in 1989 and 1990 and drew top fashion industry figures.         Though men have long dressed as women for many reasons, the modern institution of the Harlem ball began around 1960, said Marcel LaBeija, who is writing a book on the subject. The idea was to give gay blacks and Hispanics a place to dress up and perform. An earlier circuit for drag performers had been geared to white people, and black performers had sometimes whitened their faces to fit in.         The new balls did more than add racial justice. They set up changing categories within which to compete; these sometimes included Town & Country types, military personnel, corporate executives, schoolgirls and schoolboys and fashion models.         Trophies were awarded to those who best achieved ''realness,'' or resemblance to an archetype. The paradox was more bitter than sweet: performers strove to become the very people who would reject them. The best won trophies; no one won more than Miss LaBeija, who took away around 250, mostly for extravagant takes on high fashion.         Like many such performers, she had surgically implanted breasts. But she did not want a sex-change operation, explaining that women don't have it so great.         The drag ball scene, as portrayed in ''Paris Is Burning,'' had its sad aspects as well. One man says that the biggest ''realness'' a man can attain is to be convincing enough to make it home on the subway without getting beaten up for being in costume.         For most of her life, Miss LaBeija's world was the balls. Marcel said that Pepper supported herself by producing them and by teaching modeling.         In an interview with The Village Voice in 2000, Miss LaBeija said her life had grown more ordinary, and called herself an ''old-way legend in recovery.'' Without mentioning her disabled status, she volunteered that she had even given up shoplifting designer clothes, called ''mopping'' by performers who rely on the practice.         ''You mop, you get locked,'' she explained.         Correction:  May 28, 2003, Wednesday  An obituary on Monday about Pepper LaBeija, a leading performer at drag balls in Harlem, misattributed comments in a Village Voice interview about giving up shoplifting of high-fashion garments. They were made by Gerald Dupree LaBeija, a member of the House of LaBeija troupe, not by Pepper LaBeija.       
         Franchellie Margaret Cadwell, one of the first women to own a national advertising agency and a strong advocate of change in the image of women in advertisements, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 70.         The cause was brain cancer, said her friend and financial adviser Richard L. Koenigsberg.         Known in the advertising world as Frankie, Ms. Cadwell used her prominent position to press for changes in how women and older people appeared in advertising.         ''Advertising makes women look as if they have the mentality of a 6-year-old, or else they're suffering from brain damage,'' Ms. Cadwell said at a luncheon in 1970.         That year Ms. Cadwell polled more than 600 women visiting Disneyland on their most-hated commercials, producing a list of spots for products like Scope mouthwash and Bold detergent that the women found insulting. She argued that women could better be persuaded to buy products by presenting interesting facts about the products, and she urged women to avoid buying products with poor or degrading advertising.         She also represented clients in the fashion and cosmetics businesses, saying that women liked to feel beautiful. One of the most familiar lines from campaigns for her clients defended the synthetic nature of Dynel, an imitation fur, by saying: ''It's not fake anything, it's real Dynel.''         Ms. Cadwell also helped develop advertising for the introduction of the Reach toothbrush from Johnson & Johnson, a forerunner of today's heavily advertised toothbrush brands. The Reach campaigns for many years included a character with a comically oversized mouth.         Franchellie Margaret Cadwell was born on April 23, 1933, in Hamilton, Bermuda. She earned a bachelor's degree at Cornell University, where she later helped found the President's Council of Cornell Women, and an M.B.A. in marketing at the New York University Graduate School of Business.         She left her first advertising agency, Trahey/Cadwell, in the early 1960's to form Cadwell Davis, a boutique subsidiary of Compton Advertising, with Ms. Cadwell as president and Hal Davis as creative director.         For more than 20 years, the agency worked on various accounts for Johnson & Johnson, including O.B. Tampons and Act mouth rinse.         Saatchi & Saatchi acquired Compton in 1982; Ms. Cadwell and a later partner, Herman Davis, bought back the agency, by then known as Cadwell Davis Partners, in 1994. It closed last fall after Ms. Cadwell had been sick for more than a year.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Janet Collins, prima ballerina of the Metropolitan Opera House in the early 1950's and one of a very few black women to become prominent in American classical ballet, died on Wednesday in Fort Worth. She was 86 and lived there.         Ms. Collins taught dance, choreographed, performed on Broadway and in film and appeared frequently on television. But she was best known as the exquisitely beautiful dancer who was the first black artist to perform at the Metropolitan, four years before Marian Anderson sang there.         ''She was a great inspiration to me as a child in Trinidad,'' the dancer and painter Geoffrey Holder said. ''What she did by dancing the way she did -- to be prima ballerina at the Metropolitan Opera House -- gave everybody hope.''         Ms. Collins made her New York debut in 1949, dancing in her own choreography on a shared program at the 92nd Street Y. John Martin, dance critic of The New York Times, described her as ''the most exciting young dancer who has flashed across the current scene in a long time,'' calling her style an eclectic mix of modern dance and ballet.         ''There is a wonderful sense of aliveness in the dancer's presence and in her moving,'' Martin wrote. ''She is not self-absorbed, but is dancing completely and wholesouledly for an audience. On the other hand, there is no air of showing off about it, no coyness or coquetry, but only an apparent desire to establish and maintain a communicative contact.'' He praised her for the sharp, clean precision, ''the piquant tang, the arresting mental vigor'' of her dancing and choreography.         Ms. Collins's next triumph came the following year on Broadway in the Cole Porter musical ''Out of This World.'' Playing the role of Night, she danced an airborne solo created for her by Hanya Holm. She went from there to the Metropolitan, where she appeared as a principal dancer.         She performed lead roles in ''Aida,'' ''Carmen,'' the Dance of the Hours in ''La Gioconda'' and the Bacchanale in ''Samson and Delilah.''         It was not until two decades after she left the Met, however, that she was to receive major attention again in New York when, in 1974, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater paid homage to her and Pearl Primus as pioneering black women in dance.         Born in New Orleans, Ms. Collins moved with her family to Los Angeles at age 4.         She received her first dance training at a Catholic community center and went on to study primarily with Carmelita Maracci, one of the few ballet teachers who accepted black students, and with Lester Horton and Adolph Bolm.         She auditioned in Los Angeles for the Ballet Russe but said she had been told that she would either have to have special roles created for her or dance in white face.         ''I said no,'' she told Anna Kisselgoff in a 1974 interview in The Times. ''I sat on the steps and I cried and cried.'' But the rejection spurred her, she said, to work even harder, hard enough to be an exception.         Ms. Collins danced with Katherine Dunham and performed with the Dunham company in the 1943 film musical ''Stormy Weather.''         She also danced a solo choreographed by Jack Cole in the 1946 film ''The Thrill of Brazil,'' and worked with the filmmaker Maya Deren.         She toured with Talley Beatty in a nightclub act that was sometimes billed as Rea and Rico De Gard to prevent speculation about the two light-skinned dancers' race.         Ms. Collins was most active during the 1950's, when she toured with her own dance group throughout the United States and Canada and taught at academies including the School of American Ballet, affiliated with the New York City Ballet; Harkness House; and the San Francisco Ballet School.         Ms. Collins is survived by a brother, Earnest, of Fort Worth, and a sister, Betty Wilkerson of Pasadena, Calif.         Correction:  June 7, 2003, Saturday  An obituary last Saturday about Janet Collins, a former prima ballerina of the Metropolitan Opera House, misstated the precedent for black artists there. Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday and several other performers at a jazz concert in 1944 were the first; Ms. Collins first appeared in 1951.       
         Sue Sally Hale, who broke American polo's sex barrier in 1972 when she gained membership in the sport's national governing body after playing matches disguised as a man for two decades, died last Tuesday at her ranch in Coachella, Calif. She was 65.         The cause was a ruptured aorta, her former husband, Alex Hale, said.         When Hale was growing up in Southern California, polo retained an image as a rich man's sport. But the United States Polo Association, the national governing agency, now lists some 600 women among its membership of 3,600. And the Hale family remains a major presence. Hale's daughter Sunny Hale is one of the leading women's players in the world, having competed with men at polo's premier event, the United States Open.         Hale was reared amid the glitter of Hollywood's polo set. Her father, Grover Jones, a well-known screenwriter, and her mother, Susan Avery, a former ballerina, wasted no time introducing her to the sport.         ''I had my first horse at 3,'' Hale told The Press-Enterprise of Riverside, Calif., earlier this year.         Her father died at about that time, and her mother later married Richard Talmadge, a motion-picture stuntman and actor. The glamorous matches at the Riviera Country Club were close at hand, but Hale did more than watch. She was ready to compete with men by the time she reached her early teens.         But women were not welcome except for minor club matches, so she applied mascara to her lip to simulate a mustache, wore oversized shirts and pulled her hair up under her helmet. She competed under the name A. Jones, her real identity known only to her teammates at first, although it eventually became clear in the polo world that A. Jones was really Hale.         ''After a game it was a kick to clean up for the parties and mingle unrecognized with the guys I'd just played on the field with,'' she told The Los Angeles Times years later.         Hale's repeated efforts to gain admission to the United States Polo Association were rebuffed. But her friends in the polo world applied pressure as well -- a lawsuit was threatened, as she recalled -- and in 1972 the association admitted her as its first woman.         Hale became a leading player, and in December 1990 she and her daughters Sunny and Stormie, along with France's leading polo-playing woman, Caroline Anier, won the first United States Women's Open.         Hale also coached polo teams at Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo and at the Marine Corps Air Station El Toro in Santa Ana, Calif., and provided polo lessons for handicapped people.         Capt. Caryll G. Rice II, the secretary of the Marine team she coached in the mid-1990's, recalled her enthusiasm. ''She had us posting without stirrups in the middle of August out in the desert,'' he wrote in Marines magazine. '' 'Come on, it'll be fun,' she said.''         Her marriage to Alex Hale, of Carmel, Calif., ended in divorce in 1976.         In addition to Sunny, of Norman, Okla., and Coral Gables, Fla., and Stormie, of Pacific Grove, Calif., she is survived by another daughter, Dawn, of Pacific Grove; a son, Trails, of Simi Valley, Calif.; a brother, Harold Jones, of Palm Desert, Calif.; and three grandchildren.         Hale worked to organize tournaments for women. Late in 1972, when her team played in Florida against a squad from the East Coast, the emotions were overwhelming.         ''We all just sat and cried,'' she told The Press-Enterprise, ''because we didn't think we'd ever get to play. Those were great games at that tournament. And that's where women's polo really started.''       
         Marie-Claude Lalique, keeper of the Lalique family tradition in glass and crystal artistry until her retirement in 1994, died on April 14 on Captiva Island, Fla. She was 67 and lived on Captiva and in Provence.         The cause was complications of pneumonia, her family said.         Ms. Lalique was the last in the family line of renowned crystal artisans that began with her grandfather René Lalique, who designed perfume bottles for François Coty and opened a little retail shop in Paris in 1905. His work and business was carried on by his son, Marc, her father.         Ms. Lalique became both the president and creative mind of Lalique S.A., headquartered in Paris. She continued to work with the contrasts and figures in frosted and translucent crystal that characterize the Lalique look. Working from plasticine models, she updated the designs, notably by adding a range of brighter colorings. She also added elaborate jewelry designs with precious stones and enamels. In 1993, she designed her own fragrance, called Lalique.         Ms. Lalique was born in Paris and graduated from the École Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs. She originally planned a career in theater decoration but in the 1960's her overworked father asked her to help out in his studio. For her first project she bought a live dove to be the model for a set made out of crystal.         She stayed on as a partner and took over the business upon her father's death, in 1977. In 1994 she sold it to the French company Pochet.         Ms. Lalique is survived by her husband, Jean Dedouvre.       
         Elizabeth Neuffer, the award-winning foreign correspondent for The Boston Globe who died on Friday in in an automobile accident in Iraq, had traveled there to cover the aftermath of the war. She was 46.         Ms. Neuffer was a passenger in a car that apparently struck a guardrail near Samarra, about halfway between Tikrit and Baghdad, The Globe said in a statement.         She was returning from an overnight trip to Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's ancestral home, where she had been reporting on efforts to dismantle the Baath Party apparatus that had helped enforce Mr. Hussein's government.         Her translator, Waleed Khalifa Hassan al-Dulami, was also killed.         Ms. Neuffer became European correspondent of The Globe, based in Berlin, in 1994, and spent much of her time reporting on fighting in the lands that once made up Yugoslavia. That assignment led to ''The Key to My Neighbor's House: Seeking Justice in Bosnia and Rwanda'' (Picador, 2002). The book, which was well received, grew out of a 10-part series in The Globe on war crimes in those countries.         Ms. Neuffer used two case studies, one of a Bosnian Muslim searching for information about his massacred family and the other about a Tutsi who testified about the rapes she endured in Rwanda, to study the meaning of atrocity.         In 1997, the series won the Novartis Prize for Excellence in International Journalism from the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. Paul D. Wolfowitz, then dean of the school and now deputy defense secretary, said the series demonstrated ''exceptional qualities of reportorial perseverance, courage and commitment and brought important, unresolved issues to the public's attention.''         In 1998, Ms. Neuffer won a Courage in Journalism Award from the International Women's Media Foundation. In its citation, the foundation referred to a bomb explosion in a marketplace in Sarajevo in 1994 that killed 68 people.         ''She helped pick up the bodies and then wrote her story,'' the citation said.         In 1998 and 1999, Ms. Neuffer was an Edward R. Murrow fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.         She was born on June 15, 1956, in Quincy, Mass., and grew up in Wilton, Conn. She graduated from Cornell and received a master's in political philosophy from the London School of Economics and Political Science. Then she became deputy press secretary to Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut.         Ms. Neuffer moved to London, where she wrote freelance articles for The New York Times and other publications. She then worked as a reporter trainee at The Times before joining The Globe, where her first beat was federal court in Boston.         Surviving are her brother, Mark, and her companion, Peter S. Canellos, Washington bureau chief of The Globe.       
         June Carter Cash, a singer, songwriter and actress and the wife and collaborator of Johnny Cash, died yesterday in Nashville. She was 73.         She had been critically ill since having surgery at Baptist Hospital on May 7 to replace a heart valve.         Of all her accomplishments, the best known is probably the hit song ''Ring of Fire,'' which is about falling in love with Johnny Cash, and which he performed. Ms. Cash wrote the song with Merle Kilgore in 1963, long before her marriage to Mr. Cash in 1968 but after she had become close to him, working with him on cross-country tours. Instead of the usual seraphic love language of teen-angels, it used images of suffering and hellfire and is probably the most complicated popular love song in country music.         Valerie June Carter Cash was born into the Carter Family, the most important of the early country music groups, and one that helped changed it from a string-based music to a vocal music. Her mother was Mother Maybelle Carter, who sang and played guitar on songs like ''Single Girl, Married Girl'' and ''I'm Thinking Tonight of My Blue Eyes,'' some of the most important recordings of early commercial country music in the late 1920's.         She first lived in Maces Spring, Va., the hometown of her father, Ezra Carter, a farmer. But when she was 10 the family moved to Texas to be near the high-watt radio station XERA in Del Rio, Tex., where they performed on regular radio shows.         By the late 1930's she was performing with the group on records, radio shows and stages. At its largest, the group included Ms. Cash, her sisters Helen and Anita, her cousin Janette, her mother, and her mother's cousins Sara and A. P. Carter. June Carter had her own feature numbers, like ''Engine 143,'' which she sang in a wobbly but vigorously open-throated girl's voice, accompanying herself on autoharp.         The original Carter Family group dissolved in 1943. Ms. Cash, her sisters and her mother began touring and recording as Mother Maybelle and the Carter Sisters. June was the most outgoing of the group, a comedian as well as singer, and the shows mixed traditional songs of the Carter Family (like ''Will the Circle Be Unbroken'') with pop, gospel and vaudeville comedy. June created a routine involving a deep-country character named Aunt Polly.         By 1946 the group had developed a substantial audience through regular appearances on the ''Old Dominion Barn Dance'' program broadcast over WNOX in Knoxville. She crossed over to the pop charts with a hit song, ''Baby It's Cold Outside,'' recorded in 1949 with the comedy duo Homer and Jethro.         By 1950 Mother Maybelle and the Carter Sisters were regulars at Nashville's Grand Ole Opry. It was there that Ms. Cash met Elvis Presley, as well as two of her future husbands, the singer Carl Smith, and then Mr. Cash.         In her brief union with Mr. Smith she had two daughters, Carlene and Rozanna. She is also survived by her son with Johnny Cash, John Carter Cash; her stepchildren Rosanne, Tara, Kathy and Cindy; and several grandchildren.         In 1955 and 1956, the director Elia Kazan saw her perform and encouraged her to try stage acting. Newly separated, Ms. Cash took the advice, studying with Lee Strasberg and with Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York and staying with the Kazan family; on weekends she flew home to Nashville with her young daughters to perform at the Opry.         In the mid-50's she was managed by Colonel Tom Parker and toured with Elvis Presley. It was Presley who first told her about Johnny Cash, intriguing her with his description of how he managed to command an audience onstage while staying perfectly still. She and Mr. Cash finally met in 1956 backstage at the Grand Ole Opry, and she has written of an instant mutual fascination.         In liner notes for Mr. Cash's ''Love, God, Murder,'' she described his eyes. ''Those black eyes that shone like agates,'' she wrote. ''I only glanced into them because I believed that I would be drawn into his soul and I would never have been able to walk away.'' In ''I Still Miss Someone,'' from 1958, he sang, ''I never got over those blue eyes/I see them everywhere.''         By 1961, June Carter was married to her second husband, Rip Nix, and Maybelle and the Carter Sisters (renamed the Carter Family after the death of the original family's patriarch, A. P. Carter, in 1960) became part of Johnny Cash's touring show. She stuck to an old-fashioned, wholesome image, while Mr. Cash was becoming famous for drug taking, onstage swearing and explosions of temper. It was the worst period of Mr. Cash's addiction to barbiturates and amphetamines.         Ms. Cash was one of his closest confidantes, and she began hiding and throwing away his pills. She finally helped him to find counseling, and Mr. Cash often credited her thereafter with saving his life.         In 1967 they made an album together, ''Carryin' On,'' including the duet ''Jackson,'' which was a No. 1 pop hit and won a Grammy. (They won another Grammy for their duet ''If I Were a Carpenter'' in 1970.) Soon after, they became engaged.         Once married to Mr. Cash, she became a fixture in his show, telling jokes and singing, often appearing in antique lace dresses amid the silk and sequins and tasseled suits that were the standard outfits for country stars well into the 1970's. In the 1970's she also acted, and took roles on ''Gunsmoke'' and ''Little House on the Prairie,'' among other programs. She wrote a memoir, ''Among My Klediments,'' in 1979, and a book of autobiographical vignettes, ''From the Heart,'' in 1987.         She acted little after her marriage to Mr. Cash, but appeared in Robert Duvall's film ''The Apostle'' in 1997, playing the mother of Mr. Duvall's character. In 1999 she released her second solo album, ''Press On,'' a rough, unostentatious, charming record, which won a Grammy. It included songs from the Carter Family repertory as well as a new arrangement of ''Ring of Fire'' and several of her own songs, like ''Tiffany Anastasia Lowe,'' a song admonishing her granddaughter of the dangers of Hollywood life.         She and Mr. Cash divided their time between a house at the base of the Clinch Mountains in Virginia and estates in Nashville and Jamaica. Mr. Cash was seriously ill recently with diabetes and pneumonia.         Correction:  May 17, 2003, Saturday  An obituary of the country music singer and songwriter June Carter Cash yesterday misidentified the father of one of her children, Rozanna Cash. He was Rip Nix, her second husband, not Carl Smith, her first. The obituary also referred incorrectly to the recording of the song ''Jackson'' in 1967 by Ms. Cash and her third husband, Johnny Cash. While it did win a Grammy, it was not a No. 1 hit; the version of the song that became a hit on the Billboard top 40 chart was recorded by Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazlewood, also in 1967.       
         Dame Wendy Hiller, the distinguished English stage and screen actress who was George Bernard Shaw's choice to play two of his most famous heroines, Eliza Doolittle and Major Barbara, died on Wednesday at her home in Beaconsfield, England. She was 90.         Dame Wendy's performances were celebrated for spirit and integrity, and she became a major film personality despite only a handful of starring roles in movies.         In her 20's, she became an international film star by playing Eliza, the celebrated Cockney flower seller, exchanging barbs and grimaces with Henry Higgins (Leslie Howard) in the 1938 film of ''Pygmalion,'' and an heiress turned Salvation Army worker, matching wits with her professorial fiancé (Rex Harrison), in ''Major Barbara'' (1941).         Dame Wendy was also memorable for her broad cheekbones and impeccable enunciation, in a warm but somewhat quavering voice. She cemented her fame by playing a materialist turned romantic in a lyrical 1945 film, ''I Know Where I'm Going!,'' and a lonely but resilient hotelkeeper in ''Separate Tables'' (1958), which earned her an Academy Award as best supporting actress.         She played an obsessive mother in ''Sons and Lovers'' (1960), a steadfast wife in ''A Man for All Seasons'' (1966), a fussy Russian princess in ''Murder on the Orient Express'' (1974) and a compassionate nurse in ''The Elephant Man'' (1980).         Her other films included ''Outcast of the Islands'' (1952), ''Something of Value'' (1957), ''Toys in the Attic'' (1963), a television adaptation of ''David Copperfield'' (1969), ''Voyage of the Damned'' (1976), ''The Cat and the Canary'' (1979) and ''The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne (1987). Her last movie, in 1992, was the television film ''The Countess Alice,'' in which she played the title role, a former society beauty who is interviewed 50 years after her fame.         Dame Wendy said she had tried to make only films that were ''rather special and have stature,'' and to play only roles that were ''undull.'' She repeatedly rejected parts she did not believe in and passionately pursued those she liked.         She was also noted for carefully shaping and defining memorable characters. Basil Rathbone, who starred with her in the play ''The Heiress,'' an adaptation of Henry James's ''Washington Square,'' said he had never rehearsed with any performer who worked with such concentration, adding, ''She shuts everything else out in a most absolute way.''         Shaw chose her to star in his plays ''St. Joan'' and ''Pygmalion'' in a 1936 festival at Malvern, Worcester, before selecting her for the film adaptations of ''Pygmalion'' and ''Major Barbara.'' She described him as ''a most approachable and understanding person who talked to me a good deal.''         Dame Wendy recalled that at the age of 81, Shaw would stay up to all hours watching rehearsals of ''St. Joan.'' ''Once,'' she said, ''it was 3 in the morning when we finished rehearsing, and Shaw came up on the stage and said quietly, 'If you'd like to go through that again, I'd like to listen.' We were pale gray, and he was pink and fresh and blooming.''         ''He's a wonderful actor,'' she said. ''He used to act out all the parts, and he always put us to shame. He's also a cruel mimic. Once he gave me a demonstration of my walk; he said I walked like a schoolmistress. He made me feel the way I walked, and I never walked like that again.''         Wendy Hiller was born on Aug. 15, 1912, in Bramhall, a Cheshire town. Her father, Frank Watkin Hiller, a cotton-cloth manufacturer, and her mother, the former Marie Elizabeth Stone, also had three sons, René, Michael and John.         After completing secondary school, Wendy joined the Manchester Repertory Theater, where she was a bit player and later an assistant stage manager. Over the next five years, she won increasingly important roles and gained her first starring part, as the Lancashire heroine in ''Love on the Dole,'' an adaptation of Walter Greenwood's novel. Her acclaimed performance helped make the play a hit in London in 1935 and on Broadway in 1936.         A year later, she married Ronald Gow, one of the two writers who adapted the work for the stage. They had two children and lived quietly in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire. Mr. Gow died in 1993, and Dame Wendy's survivors include their daughter, Ann, and their son, Anthony.         She often limited her film and theater work to be with her family, but remarked to an interviewer that it was ''impossible to make a success'' of both home and career all the time.         ''Pygmalion,'' which was later the basis for the Lerner and Loewe musical ''My Fair Lady,'' gave Dame Wendy some of her finest scenes. As a reformed Cockney, she passes her tryout tea party by stressing her ''H's'' precisely while informing her guests that ''in Hampshire, Hereford and Hartford, hurricanes hardly ever happen,'' her famous elocution lesson.         In a later scene, she artfully blends pride and tension at a ball where she winningly impersonates a grand lady, conveying a stunning character transformation. The actress graciously credited this change entirely to Shaw, saying: ''He changes Eliza mentally. That is why the change is so profound.''         In World War II, Dame Wendy went on extensive factory tours throughout Britain, appearing as Viola in ''Twelfth Night.'' Later, on Broadway, her critical and popular triumphs included ''The Heiress'' (1947), ''A Moon for the Misbegotten'' (1957), ''Flowering Cherry'' (1959) and ''The Aspern Papers'' (1962), another James adaptation. In 1975, Queen Elizabeth II named her a Dame of the British Empire.         Dame Wendy's occasional television roles included an imperious but vulnerable principal of a women's college in a 1983 mystery, ''Miss Morison's Ghosts.'' Reviewing her performance in The New York Times, John J. O'Connor said she had ''reached that stage of her career where she can make the tiniest gesture speak volumes.''         He added, ''Her performance is the equivalent of a master class in acting.''       
         Katharine Hepburn, the actress whose independent life and strong-willed movie characters made her a role model for generations of women and a beloved heroine to filmgoers for more than 60 years, died yesterday at her home in the Fenwick section of Old Saybrook, Conn. She was 96 and also had a home in Manhattan.         Her physical presence was distinctive, her often-imitated voice filled with the vowels of a well-bred New Englander, and her sharp-planed face defined by remarkably high cheekbones. In her youth she did not have classical leading-lady looks, but a handsome beauty. In old age she was a familiar figure with her hair, gradually changing from auburn to gray, always in a topknot and her boyish figure always in the trousers that she helped to make fashionable.         She played sharp-witted, sophisticated women with an ease that suggested that there was a thin line between the movie role and the off-screen personality. The romantic comedy ''The Philadelphia Story'' and the screwball classic ''Bringing Up Baby'' were among her best, most typical roles. But through 43 films and dozens of stage and television appearances, she played comic and dramatic parts as varied as Jo in ''Little Women,'' the reborn spinster Rosie in ''The African Queen'' and Eleanor of Aquitaine in ''The Lion in Winter.''         Her life and career were dominated by her love affair with Spencer Tracy, which created one of the great romantic legends and brilliant movie pairings of their day. Tracy was unhappily married and the father of two when they met, and he remained married until the end of his life. He and Miss Hepburn lived together for 27 years, until his death in 1967, and made nine films together.         ''Woman of the Year,'' ''Adam's Rib'' and ''Pat and Mike'' are typically bright and biting Tracy-Hepburn collaborations. She is wickedly smart, slightly aloof and emotionally vulnerable. He is commonsensical, down-to-earth and deeply decent. He manages to bring her down a peg; she never minds.         Hepburn and Tracy, Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times, ''so beautifully complemented each other'' that their relationship ''never seemed to be a matter of capitulation.'' Rather, he added, it was ''a matter of understanding and acknowledging each other's boundaries.''         The frisson of their off-screen romance, always hinted at but never acknowledged during his lifetime, followed them on screen and became especially poignant when they played a married couple in their last movie together, ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.'' Tracy died just 17 days after they had finished filming it.         Through most of her career, Miss Hepburn had a reputation for being private and elusive with the press. In fact, she frequently granted interviews, although she was reticent about her personal life. But after the death of Tracy's wife, Louise, in 1983, Miss Hepburn felt free to discuss the love affair.         In later years she spoke openly about her life and career, especially in her 1991 autobiography, ''Me: Stories of My Life'' (Alfred A. Knopf). Although admittedly sketchy rather than a comprehensive memoir, the book captured the qualities that endeared Miss Hepburn to audiences: a conversational tone, a no-nonsense attitude and disarming candor. The autobiography became a best seller, a tribute to her enduring appeal across generational lines.         In 1993 she appeared in an autobiographical television documentary, ''Katharine Hepburn: All About Me,'' made for the TNT cable network. She began: ''So this is about Katharine Hepburn, public, private. Can you tell which is which?'' She added, laughing, ''Sometimes I wonder myself.''         Longing to Be a Boy         Katharine Houghton Hepburn was born into a close family whose comfortable social status and unconventional opinions fostered self-confidence and independence. Her father, Dr. Thomas Norval Hepburn, was a Hartford surgeon and a pioneer in fighting venereal disease. Her mother, Katharine Houghton, was a suffragist and a strong advocate of birth control.         In ''Me,'' Miss Hepburn finally revealed her age. ''I was born May 12, 1907,'' she wrote, ''despite everything I may have said to the contrary.'' For years she had said she was two years younger and had given her birthday as Nov. 8. That was the birthday of her older brother, Tom, who died at 16. Miss Hepburn, then 14, found his body hanging from the rafters of a house the family was visiting in New York City. The Hepburns said they never knew whether he had committed suicide and left open the possibility that he had been practicing a magic trick.         Although the family always called her Kathy or Kath, one summer Miss Hepburn so hated being a little girl that she cut her hair and called herself Jimmy. ''I thought being a girl was really the bunk,'' she said in an interview. ''But there's no bunk about Jimmy.''         After graduating from Bryn Mawr College in 1928, she had small parts in stock theater companies. She was dismissed from more than one play when she was starting out, but she retained supreme self-confidence. Late in life, she laughingly said of her younger self, ''I am terribly afraid I just assumed I'd be famous.''         She was first noticed professionally in her role as Antiope in the play ''The Warrior's Husband,'' a Greek fable in which she entered by descending a narrow staircase, carrying a stag over her shoulder.         That role led to a Hollywood screen test and her first film role, as John Barrymore's daughter in ''A Bill of Divorcement'' (1932). It was directed by George Cukor, who become one of her dearest friends (she and Tracy lived for years in the guest house on Cukor's Hollywood estate) and the director of many of her films, including ''Little Women.'' He once recalled of her screen test: ''She was unlike anybody I'd ever seen or heard. I was rather moved by the test, although the performance wasn't that good. But I thought, 'That girl is rather interesting.' ''         Fast Rise to Stardom         Miss Hepburn became a movie star quickly. She won an Academy Award for her role as Eva Lovelace, the naïve aspiring actress who learns a tough lesson about survival, in the 1933 film ''Morning Glory,'' only her third movie. Over the years she was nominated for a dozen Oscars, a record unbeaten until Meryl Streep received her 13th nomination this year. Miss Hepburn won three more, for ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,'' ''The Lion in Winter'' and ''On Golden Pond,'' but never showed up to collect any of them.         When she was 84, she looked back at those early days and, with her trademark tough-mindedness, said: ''In the beginning I had money; I wasn't a poor little thing. I don't know what I would have done if I'd had to come to New York and get a job as a waiter or something like that. I think I'm a success, but I had every advantage; I should have been.''         She also credited her husband with helping her get started in her career. For most of her life, the public thought she had never married. In fact, in 1928 she married Ludlow Ogden Smith, a member of a wealthy Pennsylvania family. She immediately made him change his name to S. Ogden Ludlow, partly because she didn't want to be known as Kate Smith.         They led separate lives long before their divorce in 1934, but they remained friendly. The town house they bought together in the Turtle Bay section of Manhattan was Miss Hepburn's home until the end of her life (along with the family home on the Connecticut River, to which she returned often).         In later years she expressed regret at the way she had treated her husband. In an interview that echoed what she wrote in ''Me,'' she assumed a self-chastising, no-nonsense tone and said she had been ''an absolute pig with Luddy, absolute pig.'' She continued: ''He was an angel. I thought of myself first, and that's a pig, isn't it?''         ''I would have been terrified alone in New York City,'' she said. ''We bought this house in '31, and then the minute I won the Academy Award, I got rid of Luddy.'' Many years later, not long before he died, ''I tried to make up to him for the horror I had caused him,'' she added. ''He was so generous-spirited that I don't think he considered it horror. He just considered it a kid who was wildly ambitious or something.''         Miss Hepburn is survived by a brother, Dr. Robert H. Hepburn, and a sister, Margaret H. Perry, both of Canton, Conn.; four nieces; and nine nephews.         Trousers as a Trademark         Despite her early success, reviewers in those days sometimes found her strident and mannered. In 1933 she returned to Broadway in a spectacular failure, ''The Lake,'' which inspired Dorothy Parker to write her famous aphorism, ''She ran the gamut of emotion from A to B.''         Of those early years, she said: ''I strike people as peculiar in some way, although I don't quite understand why. Of course, I have an angular face, an angular body and, I suppose, an angular personality, which jabs into people.''         Over time her screen presence softened and became more likable; meanwhile, society was catching up to her willful, independent style. She had been wearing pants, then considered quite unladylike, since the 1930's.         In her 1993 television autobiography, she recalled: ''I realized long ago that skirts are hopeless. Anytime I hear a man say he prefers a woman in a skirt, I say: 'Try one. Try a skirt.' '' Although her choice was based on comfort, her trademark trousered look became so influential that the Council of Fashion Designers of America gave her a lifetime achievement award in 1986.         Many of her early films are now regarded as classics. Playing a tough, determined actress in ''Stage Door'' (1937), she read a line from a play -- ''The calla lilies are in bloom again'' -- that became the all-time favorite of Hepburn impersonators. Life magazine said that ''Stage Door'' proved that she was ''potentially, the screen's greatest actress.''         She played a free-spirited heiress in ''Bringing Up Baby'' (1938), opposite Cary Grant and a leopard. But the film, now treasured, was a box-office flop, and by then her career was in decline. In 1938 she appeared on a list of actors labeled ''box-office poison'' in a poll of movie exhibitors.         Rather than appear in a film called ''Mother Carey's Chickens,'' she bought out her contract with R.K.O. She made ''Holiday,'' another classic romantic comedy with Grant, in which she was another high-spirited socialite.         Then Miss Hepburn took charge of her career in a way few women dared in those days of the studio system. Philip Barry wrote the play ''The Philadelphia Story'' for her, modeling his heroine, Tracy Lord, on Miss Hepburn. Tracy Lord is a beautiful, high-spirited rich woman, about to marry her second husband, when her first husband and a reporter who is covering the wedding arrive to create an unexpected romantic tangle.         The play was a hit, and Miss Hepburn owned the rights to it because Howard Hughes, a sometime beau, had bought them for her. She went to Louis B. Mayer, the head of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio, and sold him the property on the condition that she play the lead. She chose her friend George Cukor to direct. And she asked for Spencer Tracy and Clark Gable as her co-stars. She got Cary Grant as her former husband, James Stewart as the reporter, and a hit movie. She never lost control of her career again.         Soon she went back to Mayer with another script, ''Woman of the Year,'' the story of the unlikely romance between a hotshot political columnist and a sportswriter. She asked for Tracy, whom she had never met, to play the sportswriter. This time she got him.         A Loving Partnership         The success of ''Woman of the Year'' (1942) and the stars' off-screen relationship led to other Tracy and Hepburn films that followed a similar pattern. In ''Adam's Rib'' (1949), they are married, opposing lawyers, both nicknamed Pinky. In ''Pat and Mike'' (1952), she is a champion athlete, and he is her rough-hewn manager, with whom she falls in love.         The film was devised to show off Miss Hepburn's well-cultivated athletic ability. Almost to the end of her life she played tennis and swam, and in earlier years she golfed.         It was in ''Pat and Mike'' that Tracy spoke the often-quoted line about Miss Hepburn's figure, ''Not much meat on her, but what's there is 'cherce.' ''         Miss Hepburn often said Tracy was the best actor she had ever known and compared him in complimentary terms to a baked potato: solid, substantial stuff. ''He's meat and potatoes, meat and potatoes,'' she would say. ''I'm more like a fancy French dessert, I'm a little bit fancy, aren't I? But I wish I were meat and potatoes.'' Her other films with Tracy included the political dramas ''Keeper of the Flame'' (1942) and ''State of the Union'' (1948).         One of her most enduring films without Tracy was ''The African Queen'' (1952), in which she played the straitlaced Rosie opposite Humphrey Bogart for the director John Huston.         She wrote about it in her first book, published in 1987, whose title captures the direct, colloquial style of her writing: ''The Making of the African Queen: Or, How I Went to Africa With Bogart, Bacall and Huston and Almost Lost My Mind'' (Knopf).         Later she achieved one of her great artistic triumphs in an unlikely role, as the 12th-century Eleanor of Aquitaine in ''The Lion in Winter'' (1968). There was still something of the typical Hepburn persona in the steely manipulation and breaking heart of the aging, dismissed queen, but none of the actress's contemporary mannerisms.         Her versatility lasted well into her career. She played the distraught, drug-addicted Mary Tyrone in the 1962 film of Eugene O'Neill's ''Long Day's Journey Into Night.'' She was a fair match in toughness for John Wayne in the western ''Rooster Cogburn'' (1975). And in ''On Golden Pond'' (1981) she starred opposite Henry Fonda as a feisty older woman coping with her husband's failing memory and insisting that they should go on and live life to the fullest. In that role, the on-screen and off-screen Hepburn seemed to meld as easily as they had in her youth.         Her final screen appearance, in 1994, was a minor but tremendously emotional role in ''Love Affair.'' Playing Warren Beatty's wise old aunt, she gave advice to the woman he loved, played by Annette Bening. Miss Hepburn's age gave the role the trappings of a farewell to movies, but if she moved more slowly than before, in demeanor she was as game and modern as she had ever been, even venturing an unprintable line about ducks.         Throughout her career, she returned to the stage periodically. She appeared in ''The Millionairess,'' by George Bernard Shaw, on Broadway in 1952. In the late 1950's she also appeared in several Shakespeare plays in Stratford, Conn.         And in 1969, when she was 62, she made her singing debut on Broadway in the Alan Jay Lerner musical ''Coco,'' based on the life of the fashion designer Coco Chanel. She also appeared on Broadway in 1976 in ''A Matter of Gravity,'' by Enid Bagnold, and in 1981 in ''The West Side Waltz,'' by Ernest Thompson, who had written ''On Golden Pond.''         Her performances in all three of these plays were received with dazzling praise; the works themselves were treated more harshly. Walter Kerr of The New York Times wrote about her performance in ''The West Side Waltz'' in terms that reflected the general critical opinion: ''One mysterious thing she has learned to do is breathe unchallengeable life into lifeless lines.''         A Beloved Aunt on TV         In the 1970's she acted in television movies, including the Edwardian romantic drama ''Love Among the Ruins'' (1975), with Laurence Olivier, and ''The Corn Is Green'' (1979), both directed by Cukor. And in later years she kept busy with minor television movies.         She played a fictional version of the typically feisty Kate Hepburn character in ''Mrs. Delafield Wants to Marry'' (1986), ''Laura Lansing Slept Here'' (1988) and ''The Man Upstairs'' (1992).         In 1994 she appeared in a few scenes in the television movie ''One Christmas,'' as yet another wise old aunt. Her tailor-made Hepburn lines included these: ''I've always lived my life exactly as I wanted. I wouldn't change a single thing. No regrets.''         As she aged, she had some physical problems from which she recovered well. She had hip-replacement surgery and operations on both her shoulders, but she remained spry. Although her head shook visibly in television interviews from the 1980's on, she vehemently denied the rumor that she had Parkinson's disease, saying she had inherited her shaking head from her grandfather Hepburn.         Her most striking television appearance was not in a dramatic role, but in a 1986 tribute to Spencer Tracy. Speaking openly about their relationship at last, she read a letter she had written to him, which she later included in her autobiography. She recalled their last years together, when he was ill and had trouble sleeping, and she would sit on the floor by his side and talk. She wondered why he drank.         ''What was it, Spense?'' she asked. It was an eloquent and sentimental performance that distilled the way her public and private lives blended.         At the conclusion of ''All About Me,'' her own television biography, she said: ''In some ways I've lived my life as a man, made my own decisions. I've been as terrified as the next person, but you've got to keep a-going; you've got to dream.'' In typical Katharine Hepburn style, she faced the camera and, at the age of 85, tacitly acknowledged how close she had to be to the end.         ''I have no fear of death,'' she said. ''Must be wonderful, like a long sleep. But let's face it: it's how you live that really counts.''         With her angular beauty and unmistakable voice, Katharine Hepburn was a distinctive presence in films and on stage, whether sparring with a modern-day suitor or trading quips in Shakespearean dress. Here are some of the plays and films in which she appeared.         Plays         The Warrior's Husband -- 1932  The Lake -- 1933  Jane Eyre -- 1937  The Philadelphia Story -- 1939  Without Love -- 1942  As You Like It -- 1950  The Millionairess -- 1952  The Merchant of Venice -- 1957  Much Ado About Nothing -- 1957  Twelfth Night -- 1960  Antony and Cleopatra -- 1960  Coco -- 1969  A Matter of Gravity -- 1976  The West Side Waltz -- 1981         Films         A Bill of Divorcement -- 1932  Christopher Strong -- 1933  Morning Glory -- 1933  Little Women -- 1933  The Little Minister -- 1934  Alice Adams -- 1935  Sylvia Scarlett -- 1936  Quality Street -- 1937  Stage Door -- 1937  Bringing Up Baby -- 1938  Holiday -- 1938  The Philadelphia Story -- 1940  Woman of the Year -- 1942  Dragon Seed -- 1944  The Sea of Grass -- 1947  State of the Union -- 1948  Adam's Rib -- 1949  The African Queen -- 1951  Pat and Mike -- 1952  Summertime -- 1955  The Rainmaker -- 1956  Desk Set -- 1957  Long Day's Journey Into Night -- 1962  Guess Who's Coming to Dinner -- 1967  The Lion in Winter -- 1968  Rooster Cogburn -- 1975  Love Among the Ruins (television) -- 1975  The Corn Is Green (television) -- 1979  On Golden Pond -- 1981  Love Affair -- 1994       
         Elizabeth Fowler, who wrote a harrowing book about being the only woman among 35 passengers on a lifeboat in the Atlantic Ocean for 10 days during World War II, died on May 30 at a convalescent home in West Orange, N.J. She was 95.         On an autumn evening in 1942 she was in her early thirties and had finagled passage on a cargo ship from Africa to escape a troubled marriage and join her young daughter in Connecticut. She was knitting when a German U-boat torpedoed the ship.         Ms. Fowler endured pounding rain, hunger, excruciating thirst, frigid waves and circling sharks as she and her desperate companions bobbed through an intense human drama in a very small space. The episode, as described in news reports, columns and magazine articles, sounds very much like the inspiration for Alfred Hitchcock's 1944 movie ''Lifeboat.'' But there appears to be no direct link. Ms. Fowler's book, ''Standing Room Only'' (Dodd, Mead) was published the same year the movie was released.         Lucy Greenbaum in The New York Times Book Review called Ms. Fowler's account ''a tight, terse tale of war drama where each swell of a wave is matched by the surge of a human emotion.''         The Saturday Review of Literature called the book ''almost unbearable reading at times,'' but said that its directness and vividness made it impossible to put down.         For 35 years, until recently, Ms. Fowler lived in Montclair, N.J., and her saga only gradually became known to friends she met at the local Y.M.C.A. She was a legend there for her daily exercise regimen: swimming 18 laps and doing 36 pull-ups on the diving board well into her 90's. In her 80's, she was still putt-putting around town on a motor scooter.         As Ms. Fowler intermittently spun out the story of her life, friends in the Y's steam room at first thought it implausible.         ''We all thought she was exaggerating,'' Elizabeth Crann she said. ''She was never exaggerating.''         Elizabeth Japp was born in the United States on March 13, 1908, said Ms. Crann, who interviewed her about her life. Miss Japp's father was Sir Henry Japp, a British engineer who built the rail tunnels under the East River. A profile of Sir Henry by The New York Times in 1906 called him ''the wizard.''         In her book, Ms. Fowler, who had both American and British citizenship, said the family moved back to England when she was 12. She attended English schools and then went to study music in Paris, where someone burst into one of her lessons and demanded that the master hear two children. One was the violinist Yehudi Menuhin, who immediately became a pupil.         While in France, Miss Japp became engaged to an English businessman who died in a plane crash when she was 21. She returned to New York.         At some point she met Frank Fowler, a physician who worked on the Gold Coast for the Colonial Medical Service. They left their only daughter, Niccie, in England. After German bombing began, they sent her to live in Connecticut. After strains in her marriage, Ms. Fowler talked her way onto the West Kebar, a ship carrying palm oil from what is now Ghana to New York.         She was the only woman on board, and wrote that the men resented her because they believed she could not pull her weight. German submarines had been attacking many merchant ships, but Ms. Fowler on a pleasant evening was relaxing on deck, knitting. Suddenly, the captain screamed, ''This is it!''         Thirty-five people ended up in a 26-foot lifeboat, a self-contained universe of fear, boredom and oddity. Ms. Fowler wrote of trying to evade a man intent on kissing her, and how she finally managed to urinate in a bucket. Repeatedly and inexplicably, she wrote, she mourned the Burberry coat she had lost.         Mostly she told of her boat mates and their interaction. ''Human decency showed more brightly with some,'' she wrote. ''That was all -- but that was everything too.''         The lifeboat was finally spotted from land, off the coast of Barbados. After they were rescued, she worked as a nanny in Connecticut but was also something of a celebrity. Lord & Taylor displayed her bedraggled dress from the lifeboat in its window, and women's magazines profiled her. The columnist Elsa Maxwell wrote that she ''has had more emotional experiences out of this war than any other human being I know.''         Ms. Fowler, as a result, always thought she was the inspiration for Alfred Hitchcock's 1944 movie, although her book was a published a month after the release of ''Lifeboat.'' John Steinbeck, who wrote the novella and the screen treatment that became ''Lifeboat,'' does not seem to have mentioned her experience.         But there is no question that her story was in the public eye, and when Ms. Fowler later met the movie's star, Tallulah Bankhead, Miss Bankhead said, ''So I was supposed to be you,'' a comment Ms. Fowler did not take as flattering.         For many years, Ms. Fowler worked as an editor for book and magazine publishers. She is survived by her daughter, Niccie Sesson of England, and a grandson, Ms. Crann said.         She treasured a piece of the lifeboat's sail her companions had given her. ''To a good shipmate,'' it said.       
         Lois Fried Rosenfield, a theatrical and film producer with her husband, Maurice, died on May 25 at her home in Glencoe, Ill. She was 78.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Rosenfield and her husband backed Broadway productions like ''Barnum'' (1980), a 1983 revival of ''The Glass Menagerie'' and ''Singin' in the Rain'' (1985), which they also presented in London.         Their company, Rosenfield Productions, got its start in 1973 with the film ''Bang the Drum Slowly,'' a classic baseball tale. Mrs. Rosenfield took credit for casting a virtually unknown Robert De Niro as the doomed catcher, and Mr. Rosenfield, a Chicago corporate lawyer, appeared as a team owner.         Off Broadway, in 1988, the couple helped produce a new play by Athol Fugard, ''The Road to Mecca.'' They also produced ''Falsettoland'' Off Broadway and ''Other People's Money'' in Chicago.         Lois Rosenfield grew up in Chicago, the daughter of a clothing manufacturer. She attended public schools and the University of Wisconsin. Besides her husband, she is survived by her sons, James, of Santa Fe, N.M., and Andrew, of Lake Forest, Ill.; her brothers, Howard and Donald Fried; and four grandchildren.       
         Beverly Bailis Karp, a producer of films and plays and a co-producer of the film ''My Dinner With André,'' died on Tuesday at her home in New York. She was 72.         The cause was emphysema, her son David said.         Mrs. Karp and George W. George produced ''My Dinner With André,'' starring André Gregory and Wallace Shawn, in 1981. It is about two longtime friends who get together, dine and carry on a humorous, reflective discussion on topics like art and their lives.         The film was directed by Louis Malle, who also directed the 1994 film ''Vanya on 42nd Street'' (an adaptation of a Chekhov tale), of which Mrs. Karp was associate producer.         Beverly Bailis was born in Manhattan and grew up in New York City and New England; in 1949 she moved with her family to Los Angeles. She received a bachelor's degree in English, magna cum laude, from the University of California at Los Angeles, where she also was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.         After working as a script reader for the producer David Brown at 20th Century-Fox and for independent producers, she returned to New York in 1968.         In New York she became a magazine writer as well as a producer. In recent years she produced a number of plays Off Broadway and Off Off Broadway.         In 1955 she married Harvey L. Karp; the marriage ended in divorce in 1987.         Besides her son David, of Venice, Calif., and Manhattan, she is survived by another son, Nicholas, of Princeton, N.J.; a sister, Eleanor Sheldon of Studio City, Calif.; and two grandchildren.       
         Selma Koch, a Manhattan store owner who earned a national reputation by helping women find the right bra size, mostly through a discerning glance and never with a tape measure, died Thursday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 95 and a 34B.         In the final years of her life, Mrs. Koch appeared on national television and radio programs to discuss her specialty and her occupational longevity. She relished her celebrity, but not as much as she loved guiding the generations of women who visited her store: she worked seven 10-hour days last week instead of her usual six.         Her grandson Danny said he guessed that her only regret would be not dying in the family's store, the Town Shop on Broadway at 82nd Street, something she had often said she hoped to do.         But she certainly lived there almost as much as in her Manhattan apartment, in the end helping the great-grandchildren of her original customers buy apparel like swimsuits, pajamas and girdles, an old-fashioned product she insisted on keeping in stock.         She kept the original customers, too.         ''Sometimes a lady will come in with either a walker, or a wheelchair, or a nurse,'' Mrs. Koch said in an interview with The Associated Press last year. ''She can barely move and she'll say to me, 'You know, you sold me my trousseau.' ''         Brassieres remained the foundation of the store's business, though most of the thousands available are kept discreetly out of sight. The prices are somewhat higher than in department stores, since immediate service is the selling point.         ''We don't let people roam around the store,'' Mrs. Koch said in an interview last year on WNYC radio. ''The minute a customer comes in, she's approached. You can walk from end to end on the floor at Lord & Taylor and not see a person.''         A quick look would tell her a customer's proper bra size, which she maintained that three-quarters of women did not know. Not a few middle-aged women cling to the size they wore at 16, said her grandson, who works in the store.         ''I never had to try six brassieres on a customer,'' Mrs. Koch told WNYC. ''Two was plenty. I mean, I knew in a minute what was right, finished, buy it, out.''         Selma Rose Lichtenstein was born in Manhattan on June 29, 1907. Her father moved from job to job, including jukebox and real estate sales. She graduated from Columbia University and attended its Graduate School of Journalism.         Her first job was in advertising, and a client was the Town Shop. The owner's son Henry Koch flirted with her, but she thought he was married. Then a friend referred to him as ''the most eligible bachelor around.''         ''So I went back,'' Mrs. Koch told The A.P. ''With more charm.''         Their first date was the opening night of ''Showboat'' in 1927, and they were married the next year, her son Peter said.         He and David, another son, survive her, as do six grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.         Mrs. Koch went to work in the family store and learned to fit bras from her husband's sister. At one time the business had expanded to four stores, but is now down to one. It moved two blocks to its present location last year.         Mrs. Koch, meticulously manicured and coiffed, habitually perched behind a roll-top desk with a bird's-eye view of the fitting rooms. Pictures in which she posed with customers from many states surrounded her: her appearance on Rosie O'Donnell's television show last year prompted many visits. She took phone orders, ordered merchandise and helped with challenging fittings.         In interviews, she consistently pointed out a trend: bra sizes are growing. (JJ is now the biggest size, up from DD as recently as the early 1980's.)         Mrs. Koch never stopped wondering why people kept asking her questions. ''What's the big deal?'' the small woman asked in her raspy, staccato voice. ''I'm just selling bras.''         Correction:  July 5, 2003, Saturday  An obituary on June 14 about Selma Koch, the owner of a Manhattan lingerie shop, misstated her educational background. She took advertising courses from Columbia University's extension service, now called the School of General Studies. The university says it has no record of her having graduated from Columbia College or having attended the Columbia journalism school.       
         Khieu Ponnary, the quiet Cambodian intellectual who was the first wife of the Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot and a prominent member of the movement in its early days, died on Tuesday in Cambodia. She was 83.         A nephew, Ieng Vuth, said she died in the northwestern city of Pailin.         Despite the notoriety of her husband, Khieu Ponnary had been out of the public eye for decades. Sometime during the austere years of guerrilla war, she began suffering from mental illness. By the time the Khmer Rouge won power in 1975 and undertook the revolution that led to the deaths of 1.7 million people, she was incapacitated by her illness.         The daughter of a judge, Khieu Ponnary led a privileged life in the French colonial era. She attended the elite Lycee Sisowath in Phnom Penh where in 1940 she became the first Cambodian woman to earn a baccalaureate degree.         Intent on earning teaching credentials, she traveled to Paris with her younger sister, Khieu Thirith. There they met their future husbands, who became masterminds of the Khmer Rouge revolution.         Khieu Thirith, the outgoing if less studious sister, married Ieng Sary, who was part of the brain trust under Pol Pot, then known by his given name, Saloth Sar.         The two men were students in Paris and members of a Marxist-Leninist study circle; they spent most of their time plotting how to end French rule of their country. As they embarked on their secretive pursuit of a Communist revolution, the Cambodian radicals chose wives they could trust. By marrying sisters who shared their political goals they cemented that bond with family ties.         When they returned to Cambodia, Khieu Ponnary became a widely respected high school teacher, helping to support her husband as he began organizing for the revolution. Eventually both had to flee the capital to avoid arrest by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, then the Cambodian leader.         Ieng Sary became foreign minister of Cambodia after the Khmer Rouge victory. Khieu Thirith, then known by her married name, Ieng Thirith, became the minister of social affairs in a regime that became notorious for overworking the population, starving many to death and tearing apart families.         They became the most public members of the short-lived Communist government, while Khieu Ponnary was largely invisible, housed separately from Pol Pot and put under the care of her sister.         Once the Vietnamese overthrew the Khmer Rouge in 1979, Pol Pot separated from Khieu Ponnary and took a much younger wife, with whom he had a daughter.         He died in 1998, escaping all efforts to capture him and try him for crimes against humanity.         Despite a sojourn in China for medical treatment, Khieu Ponnary never recovered. She lived with her sister and brother-in-law in Pailin, where they were granted amnesty by the Cambodian government, after a major defection from Pol Pot and the remaining Khmer Rouge in 1996.       
         Celia Cruz, the Cuban singer who became the queen of Latin music, died yesterday at her home in Fort Lee, N.J. She was 77.         The cause was complications after surgery for a brain tumor, said a spokeswoman, Blanca Lasalle.         Onstage, Ms. Cruz was a petite woman who wore tight, glittering dresses and towering wigs, dancing in high heels and belting songs that she punctuated with shouts of ''Azucar!'' (''Sugar!''). She was a vocal powerhouse, with a tough, raspy voice that could ride the percussive attack of a rumba or bring hard-won emotion to a lovelorn Cuban son.         ''When people hear me sing,'' she said in an interview with The New York Times, ''I want them to be happy, happy, happy. I don't want them thinking about when there's not any money, or when there's fighting at home. My message is always felicidad -- happiness.''         In a career that began in the 1940's, Ms. Cruz sang with every major Latin bandleader and recorded more than 70 albums. She sang a full spectrum of Afro-Cuban music, from the religious chants of santería to mambos and cha-chas to modern salsa. Yet unlike many of the Latin musicians in her wake, she didn't court a crossover audience. She recorded in Spanish, modestly saying that her English was not good enough.         Ms. Cruz was born in Havana to a poor family, and she regularly sang her brothers and sisters to sleep. She won a radio talent contest after a cousin took her to the radio station García Serra; first prize was a cake. She went on to study at the Havana Conservatory and to sing on radio programs. In 1950, she joined La Sonora Matancera, Cuba's most popular band. ''I wanted to be a mother, a teacher and a housewife,'' she told The New York Times. ''But when I began to sing with La Sonora Matancera, I thought, 'This is my chance, and I'm going to do it.' ''         She toured with the group constantly, sometimes singing five sets a day; they were also headliners at Havana's most celebrated nightclub, the Tropicana, and performed on radio and television. But in 1960, a year after Fidel Castro took power in Cuba, she was touring Mexico with La Sonora Matancera and decided not to return to Cuba. Years later, Cuba refused permission for her to attend her father's funeral.         Ms. Cruz moved to New York in 1961, and later to Fort Lee. In 1962, she married Pedro Knight, a trumpeter from La Sonora Matancera who became her musical director and manager. He survives her, along with two sisters, Gladys Becquer and Dolores Cruz.         In New York, she held on to her Cuban roots while adding some of the city's Puerto Rican and later Dominican elements to her music. She sang with Tito Puente's orchestra in the 1960's, a collaboration she periodically renewed through the next decades, and in the 1970's she also sang with bandleaders like Johnny Pacheco, Willie Colón and Ray Barretto. She performed with the Fania All-Stars at Yankee Stadium in 1975.         ''Women are afraid to sing salsa,'' she once said. ''I don't know why. Maybe they think it's for men.'' She added, ''But I think everybody can sing everything.''         She continued to modernize her music, working with Miami-based producers like Willy Chirino and Emilio Estefan and with Sergio George in New York, who produced her most recent albums. She also collaborated with many of the musicians who admired her, among them Luciano Pavarotti, Gloria Estefan, David Byrne of Talking Heads and the Brazilian songwriter Caetano Veloso.         In 1989, Ms. Cruz won a Grammy award for best tropical Latin performance for an album in collaboration with Mr. Barretto, ''Ritmo en el Corazón.'' In 1989, Yale University awarded Ms. Cruz an honorary doctorate (alongside Stephen Hawking), and in 1990 the main street of Little Havana in Miami, Calle Ocho, added the name Celia Cruz Way. In 1994, President Clinton gave her the National Medal of Arts. She won the first Latin Grammy Award for best tropical album in 2000. Until last year, Ms. Cruz continued to perform and record constantly on an international circuit that included jazz festivals and arena concerts along with Latin clubs.         She had surgery for a brain tumor in December 2002, but in February she returned to the studio to record an album, ''Regalo de Alma,'' that is due for release Aug. 5 on Sony Discos. That same month, her 2002 album, ''La Negra Tiene Tumbao,'' won the Grammy Award for best salsa album. In March, the Telemundo network broadcast a live concert tribute to Ms. Cruz, in which she performed alongside other Latin stars, including Marc Anthony, to raise money for the Celia Cruz Foundation for Hispanic students to study music. It will give its first five grants on her birthday this year, Oct. 21.       
         Leela Chitnis, an actress whose half-century-long 40-film career in India progressed from romantic roles to the motherly ones for which she is best remembered, died on Monday at a hospital in Danbury, Conn. She was 93. She had been living in Connecticut for many years to be near her family.         Ms. Chitnis began her acting career onstage at a time women seldom worked as actors. Her son Manavedra Chitnis said that women who did act were regarded as prostitutes, and so Ms. Chitnis was shunned by Brahmans, the priestly caste of which she was a member.         She did not care, her son said, nor was she abashed by these prejudices when she moved on, in the 1930's, to India's large and lively movie industry in Bombay, now known as Bollywood. She began playing romantic leads and became one of the best-known heroines in the country.         From 1948 into the 1980's, she worked as a character actor, becoming famous in the 1950's and 60's for her portrayals of mothers. In these roles, she developed an image of sober probity, underlined by gold-rimmed glasses and white saris.         ''Whenever I think of her, I still shake with awe,'' said Jyotirmoy Datta, the senior arts editor for News-India Times, an English-language weekly published in New York. ''She seemed to be always right and prepared to follow the straight path of virtue.''         In a review of her work in 1997 in India-West magazine, published in Emeryville, Calif., R. M. Vijayakar called Ms. Chitnis the Duchess of Depression, not least because of her characteristic cough.         ''If she appeared on screen it was to cough consumptively, gobble spoonfuls of syrup from bottles perched so precariously on bedside tables that they overturned and crashed to the floor when there was no money to buy another,'' he wrote.         Ms. Chitnis was born on Sept. 9, 1909, in a small town near Bombay. Her father was an English professor who adhered to Brahmo Samaj, a religious movement that rejected caste.         She married a much older man at 15 or 16, and quickly had four children. The couple supported India's struggle for independence from Britain and once risked arrest by harboring Manabendra Nath Roy, a Marxist freedom fighter.         After they divorced, she worked as a schoolteacher and began acting onstage in melodramas typical of the time. She appeared in several movies, and went through a Bombay university in order to be hired by a major studio, Bombay Talkies; it hired only college graduates.         She soon made three hit films -- ''Kangan,'' ''Bandhan'' and ''Jhoola'' -- with Ashok Kumar, who became one of India's top male stars. In a much-remembered scene in ''Kangan'' (1939), she overhears the playwright with whom she is in love declaring his love to another woman -- unaware that he is reading lines from his latest play. The Hindustan Times, in its obituary, said her acting in the movie ''epitomized rustic beauty in mainstream Hindi cinema.''         Ms. Chitnis began playing mothers in 1948 with the patriotic film ''Shaheed.'' Her best known maternal role, according to The Hindustan Times, was in ''Awaara'' (1951), in which she is deserted by her husband for suspected infidelity.         Her last movie was ''Dil Tujhko Diya,'' in 1985.         For older Indians, Ms. Chitnis is remembered as the first Indian movie star to endorse Lux soap, in 1941. Foreign celebrities had previously been the ones to endorse this and other consumer products.         In addition to her son Manavendra, Ms. Chitnis is survived by her sons Benoy and Raj, and by three grandchildren.       
         Elisabeth Welch, an expatriate cabaret singer who mixed elegant phrasing and emotive power to craft extraordinary interpretations of the songs of America's Jazz Age and Britain's musical stage, died on Tuesday at a nursing home outside London. She was 99.         Like Josephine Baker and Mabel Mercer, Miss Welch was a black woman born at the beginning of the 20th century who made an exceptional singing career outside of the United States. In Paris and London she was the darling of cafe society and, of greater importance to her, of such composers as Cole Porter and Noël Coward.         Only when Miss Welch returned to perform in New York in 1980 after a half-century absence did Americans grasp the quality of her work and discover a living link with some of the great names of American musical theater. Her influence was enhanced by performing abilities that were substantially intact at an advanced age.         In 1980 she received excellent reviews for her role in ''Black Broadway.'' In 1986 she was nominated for a Tony for her role in ''Jerome Kern Goes to Hollywood'' and won an Obie for her one-woman show, ''Time to Start Living.'' In 1989 she charmed audiences at Weill Recital Hall.         Writing in The New York Post about her one-woman show, Clive Barnes called her an original.         ''With her sweetness, her gentility, arsenic-laced with a sense of roguish innuendo and pagan sensuality, she is like no one else,'' he wrote. ''She has class, and class, and class. A saloon singer who would make any saloon into a salon.''         In his review of the Kern show, Frank Rich of The New York Times urged readers to write their representatives in Congress demanding that she be detained in the United States ''as a national resource too rare and precious for export.''         Or perhaps too precious not to export. She sang in a Paris cabaret frequented by Gertrude Stein and in the surreal nightclubs of pre-Hitler Berlin. She introduced ''Stormy Weather'' to British audiences, stopping shows at the London Palladium, where 50 years later she would receive five standing ovations.         Elisabeth Welch was born in Manhattan on Feb. 27, 1904, though some accounts say 1908 and her age varied in interviews over the years. In an interview with The Times on Feb. 1, 1986, she was said to be almost 77, which would mean she was born in 1909.         She was named after her mother, who was Scottish and spelled her name in the Scottish fashion. Her father, who descended from Africans and American Indians, was a coachman and later a gardener on an estate in Englewood, N.J.         She grew up in the area where Lincoln Center is now, which was then predominantly Irish. Her poor family went to Irish wakes hoping for sandwiches. She was the middle of three children, the others being brothers.         Her father, a strict Baptist, frowned upon girls who whistled, telling her, according to a 1987 interview in The Times of London, that ''whistling girls and crowing hens never come to good ends.''         Even before graduating from high school, she sang in the choruses of shows. Her father drew the line when he learned that she was appearing in a Broadway show called ''Runnin' Wild'' in 1923. She sang ''Singing Charleston'' to accompany the new dance, and in later years was often credited with having introduced the dance to the United States.         A brief marriage, when she was 18, ended in divorce, and she left no immediate survivors.         Using her nickname, Mr. Welch told his wife, ''Girlie's on the boards, she's doomed.'' In anger, he left the family forever.         After high school she did social work for a settlement house while also appearing in popular all-black revues. She considered her real debut to be ''Blackbirds of 1928,'' starring Bill (Bojangles) Robinson.         She was popular and accompanied the show to Paris, where it played the Moulin Rouge in 1929. She received her first favorable mentions in the press and appeared as a singer in chic nightclubs. Jean Patou, the designer, began giving her two dresses a year, in spring and fall.         In the summer of 1930 she was asked to come to New York to open a new room, the Salon Royal. An advertisement in The Times, titled ''Society's Latest Fad,'' called her ''an overnight sensation.''         Miss Welch performed Porter's song ''Love for Sale'' at the club. She had fallen in love with the new song when shown its score, but had waited to sing it until Porter's revue, ''The New Yorkers,'' opened. She considered that plaintive serenade to streetwalkers a work of poetry.         ''I thought of it as a street cry,'' she told The Times in 1980. ''I always had a sympathy for prostitutes. I knew some in Paris. They make me cry.''         Kathryn Crawford, a white actress, sang the song in Porter's revue. Critics were aghast that the wholesome-seeming young lady, dressed like a schoolgirl, sang such salacious stuff.         Porter, in a fury, left for Paris three days after the opening. The show's producers had meanwhile heard Miss Welch's more worldly rendition and hired her to replace Miss Crawford. Miss Welch insisted on apparel that an upmarket prostitute might fancy.         ''I walked on in black satin and wore high patent-leather shoes with red heels,'' she said in an interview with The Associated Press in 1980. ''I had a red maribou and a hat with an egret in it. The woman was very grand.''         Porter was impressed when he met Miss Welch in Paris and asked her to appear in a show he was staging in London. She said yes.         The show was ''Nymph Errant,'' which starred Gertrude Lawrence. Porter wrote the song ''Solomon'' for Miss Welch, and the novelty tune became her signature.         While she waited for Porter's show to open in 1933, she sang in a London show called ''Dark Doings,'' in which she introduced the song ''Stormy Weather'' to Britain.         She realized she had set a pattern, repeatedly singing what turned out to be a show's hit song and often nothing else. She jokingly called herself ''one-song Welch'' and in 1935 again overwhelmed audiences with the song ''Shantytown,'' which Ivor Novello, the star of prewar London musicals, wrote for her in his ''Glamorous Night.''         During World War II she entertained British troops with John Gielgud. In 1947 she brought ''La Vie en Rose'' to London, having heard Édith Piaf sing it in Paris.         Ms. Welch's decision to remain in Europe and make London her home may have resulted from a combination of her success there, her mother's Scottish and Irish ancestry and a visceral sense of belonging. Although American by birth, The Independent of London reported, she was British in thought and interest.         ''I never had any feeling about being different from anybody else,'' The Independent quoted her as saying. ''It equipped me to be an international person all my life.''         Miss Welch said many times that she never had any particular plan for her life. She claimed to be as surprised as anybody when she turned up in New York as a new discovery in 1980.         ''Things that have happened in my life just happened,'' she told The Times. ''I never had any star that I strove toward.''       
         Lucille Roberts, a businesswoman whose ambition to create ''the McDonald's of health clubs'' inspired a chain of bargain-basement gyms for women, died yesterday at New York University Downtown Hospital in Manhattan. She was 59.         The cause was lung cancer, said her husband, Bob. She lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Roberts built a chain of 50 gyms with 200,000 members in the New York metropolitan region by charging half or less of what many competitors asked. Her clubs were for women only, partly because she wanted to protect women from being ogled in coed gyms.         Mrs. Roberts said her target market was secretaries, teachers and the wives of policemen, and she said she knew how to please them -- an assertion the $50 million collected each year from members seemed to support.         ''It is only the upper classes who are into exercise for health,'' she said in an interview with The New York Times in 1997. ''The middle classes just want to look good. We have tried health classes. They just want to fit into tight jeans.''         Her business strategy involved recruiting as many members as possible and crowding them into large gyms. By continually adding more gyms, she was able to keep down the cost of advertising -- a significant and critical expenditure for health clubs -- on a per-member basis. The result was summed up by a promotional slogan Lucille Roberts used for years: ''More Gym Less Money.''         Ms. Roberts was born in the Soviet Union on Dec. 7, 1943, in what is now an independent country, Tajikistan. In an interview in Success magazine in 1998, she said her father lost a son in the war.         ''I became a surrogate son,'' she said. ''I never knew there was anything in the world I couldn't do. It was just a matter of when and how.''         Her family was Jewish, and, facing religious persecution in the Soviet Union, immigrated to the United States and settled in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn when she was 13. She graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1964 and worked in a succession of jobs in retailing.         The last was at Kitty Kelly Inc., which sold shoes and other merchandise. Mrs. Roberts was promised a $50 raise if she met a difficult sales target. She reached it, but did not receive the raise. She quit and started her own business with her husband.         In addition to him, she is survived by her sons Kevin and Kirk, both of Manhattan.         Mrs. Roberts hated to deal with inventory and wanted to find a business in which things like colors and sizes did not matter, she said in an interview with CNNfn in 1999. A self-described exercise nut, she said her first idea was to teach an exercise class for women at a hotel.         Instead, she decided that what women really needed was a place where they could exercise with no men around, The Wall Street Journal reported in 1997. She and her husband put up $10,000 of their savings, borrowed $5,000 each from their parents and opened a little ''spa'' opposite Macy's in Manhattan.         The club was an immediate success, but its name, the Body Shop, caused confusion: People thought it was an auto-repair business. Within two years, two additional clubs opened, and the name was changed to Lucille Roberts.         The overriding goal was to be friendly to women. No heavy weights or elaborate machines were emphasized; classes were easy to follow and taught by people with less-than-perfect bodies. The classes lasted only 30 minutes so they could easily fit into women's schedules.         The Robertses also invested heavily in real estate, buying whole shopping centers as well as individual buildings for health clubs. At the time of her death, they were about to begin selling franchises elsewhere in the United States, Mr. Roberts said.       
         Anne Rogovin, a teacher of mentally handicapped children who wrote manuals on child rearing with admonitions like ''Turn off the TV!'' died on July 7 at her home in Buffalo. She was 84.         The cause was brain cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Rogovin's years as a teacher made her a believer in letting a child learn by doing, whether it led to things made or knowledge acquired. As a classroom teaching aide she devised what she called learning boards to stimulate the senses.         She came up with more than 100 of them, evoking tastes and smells with foods and spices, or putting common utensils to their proper uses, or conjuring up weather with cardboard clouds. Her work led to two exhibitions -- ''Learning By Doing'' (1971) and ''Please Do Touch'' (1977) -- at a Buffalo gallery.         It also prompted her first book, ''Learning by Doing: An Illustrated Handbook for Parents and Teachers of Children Who Learn Slowly'' (Mafex, 1971; Ideal Publications, 1977). She organized workshops for parent groups, and her articles began to appear in newspapers and periodicals.         Her writings found a national response and went through various editions into the 1990's. They included ''Let Me Do It!'' with an introduction by Benjamin Spock (1990); ''Dear Parents: Letters to Parents of Young Children'' (Highsmith, 1995); ''1001 Activities for Children,'' with a foreword by Edward Asner (Random House, 1999); and ''Turn Off the TV And . . .'' with a foreword by Charles Kuralt.         Anne Snetsky was born in Buffalo and graduated in 1940 from the State College for Teachers, now part of SUNY Buffalo, where she also received a master's degree, magna cum laude, in special education in 1963.         She and her husband, Milton Rogovin, suffered professionally in the 1950's as activists of the political left who protested the trial and sentencing of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Mr. Rogovin, an optometrist, lost his practice and became a nationally known documentary photographer; Mrs. Rogovin, refusing to sign the mandatory loyalty declaration, was unemployable in the Buffalo school system.         Instead, she taught mentally retarded children in the Buffalo region for the state's Board of Cooperative Educational Services for about 30 years, even as her writing career flourished.         In addition to her husband, whose work is currently on special exhibition at the New-York Historical Society, she is survived by two daughters, Ellen R. Hart of Melrose Park, Pa., and Paula Rogovin of Teaneck, N.J.; a son, Mark, of Forest Park, Ill.; five grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.         Correction:  July 24, 2003, Thursday  An obituary on Sunday about Anne Rogovin, a teacher of mentally handicapped children and an author of manuals on child rearing, misstated the current name of her alma mater, which was once the State College for Teachers at Buffalo. It is Buffalo State College of SUNY, not SUNY Buffalo.       
         Jean R. Warnke, a volunteer in social service organizations in Washington and the widow of Paul C. Warnke, a top official in the Johnson and Carter administrations, died on Monday in a Brooklyn hospice. She was 80 and lived in Washington.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Warnke, born Jean Farjeon Rowe in Ossining, N.Y., was a member of the board of Family and Child Services Inc. of Washington, serving as its president from 1984 to 1986. She also volunteered for the women's committee of the Smithsonian Institution and was a volunteer mediator in small claims court in Washington. She received a bachelor's degree from American University in 1973.         Mrs. Warnke's husband died in 2001. Her survivors include two daughters, Margaret, of Vineyard Haven, Mass., and Georgia, of South Pasadena, Calif.; three sons, Thomas, of Long Beach, Calif., and Stephen and Benjamin, both of Brooklyn; a brother, George Rowe Jr. of Irvington, N.Y.; and 11 grandchildren.       
         Gertrude Samuels, a writer and photographer whose 50-year career took her from the displaced-persons camps of postwar Europe to the blight of drug addiction in America's cities, died Wednesday at her home on the Upper West Side. She was 93.         Beginning in the wartime 1940's, she worked as a writer, photographer and editor on the staff of The New York Times Magazine. In 1975, she turned to freelance writing.         Before and after, her byline appeared in many publications, to which she contributed picture essays. She remained a United Nations correspondent for The New Leader magazine until a few years ago.         As a writer, she was at home in genres beyond topical journalism. She produced books for young readers, stage plays and a biography of David Ben-Gurion, along with other writings on Israel.         Miss Samuels was an early practitioner of photojournalism as documentary. She covered national and foreign affairs for The New York Post, Newsweek and Time magazine before she joined the staff of The Times in 1943.         Her pictorial articles also appeared in magazines like National Geographic, Redbook and The Saturday Evening Post. Her reports were broadcast overseas by the United States Information Service.         Gertrude Samuels was born in Manchester, England, and came with her family to Chicago when she was 14. She attended Busch Conservatory of Music there and George Washington University but dropped out to join the staff of The New York Post in 1937.         She returned to the classroom years later, after leaving The Times. She received a B.A. in English literature at N.Y.U. in 1982; she earned a master's degree one year later.         At The Times, in 1943, she wrote news summaries for the Week in Review before The Times Magazine assigned her to cover events nationally and abroad.         She toured displaced-persons camps in Europe, traveled the Middle East reporting on the birth of Israel and the refugees in the region, and, in the early 1950's, contributed magazine articles from Southeast Asia, North Africa and Korea. On the home front, she told readers about the racial unrest attending school desegregation in the South, juvenile delinquency in the inner cities and drug addiction.         Her work was recognized with photography awards and a 1955 George Polk Award, among others.         ''B-G: Fighter of Goliaths; The Story of David Ben-Gurion'' (Crowell, 1961; rev. ed. 1974) included her own photographs from Israel, as did ''The Secret of Gonen: Portrait of a Kibbutz on the Border in a Time of War'' (Avon, 1969).         Her other books included ''The People vs. Baby: A Documentary Novel'' (Doubleday, 1967); ''Run, Shelley, Run!'' (Crowell, 1974); ''Mottele: A Partisan Odyssey'' (Harper, 1976); ''Adam's Daughter'' (Crowell, 1977); ''Of David and Eva: A Love Story'' (New American Library, 1978); and ''Yours, Brett'' (Lodestar, 1988).         Among her plays were ''The Plant That Talked Back'' and ''Judah the Maccabee and Me,'' both produced at the Lambs Club Theater in 1970.         Miss Samuels is survived by her son, Paul Oppenheimer of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.         Gertrude Samuels is among those featured at an exhibition in the Mugar Library of Boston University in Boston, ''On the Front Line: Women Journalists on War and Politics,'' which opened in January.       
         Jane Barbe, who was known to millions, though not by name or appearance, as the voice of telephone-company recordings and voice-mail systems across America, died on July 18 in Roswell, Ga. She was 74.         The cause was complications of cancer, said her husband, John.         Ms. Barbe began her career of delivering impersonal messages in friendly, helpful tones in 1963. Working for Electronic Communications Inc. in Atlanta, she recorded the time and temperature information provided by phone companies, then tackled the ''intercept'' messages -- like ''The number you have dialed is not in service'' -- that greet misdialers and the misinformed.         She also recorded daily horoscopes as well as a short-lived series of seasonal messages from Mrs. Claus, which was discontinued after out-of-state parents complained about the long-distance charges run up by their children.         In the early 1980's, Ms. Barbe was chosen by Octel Communications, now part of Avaya, to record messages for its nascent voice-mail technology. Her voice is now heard at thousands of companies, helping employees to administer personal greetings and outside callers to find their way out of ''voice-mail jail.''         Ms. Barbe's talent involved more than a pleasant phone manner. She had the ability to give readings of precise lengths, often measured in tenths of seconds, which are required in a medium in which messages are often assembled from dozens of individual sound bites.         She was also adept at vocal characterizations. She recorded messages for an Australian phone company in an Australian accent and provided the voice of Margaret Mitchell for the 1988 film '' 'Gone With the Wind': The Making of a Legend.'' The soft Southern accent came naturally to her; she usually suppressed it in the recording studio.         Born Jane Schneider on July 28, 1928, in Florida, she moved with her family to Atlanta as a small child. She studied drama at the University of Georgia.         She is survived by her husband, John, a composer who grew up in Scarsdale, N.Y.; a daughter, Susan Stubin of Passaic, N.J.; a son, David, of Athens, Ga., and seven grandchildren.         In contrast to her sometimes long-winded messages for voice-mail systems, her own home answering machine's message was refreshingly direct and to the point. ''I keep it as simple as possible,'' she explained in an interview with The New York Times last year. ''I have a friend whose machine says, 'At the beep, speak.' I like that.''       
         Isabelle d'Orléans et Bragance, Countess of Paris, who was married to a pretender to the throne of France, died on July 5 in Paris. She was 93.         The countess was the widow of Henri, Count of Paris, whom many royalists wanted to become King Henri VI of France. He died in 1999, and the couple's eldest son, also called Henri, claimed the title of Count of Paris and Duke of France, becoming the new pretender.         Her full name was originally Isabel Marie Amélie Louise Victoire Thérèse Jeanne of Orléans and Bragana, or Bragance in French. A granddaughter of the last empress of Brazil, she was born in France at the home of her paternal grandparents, in the Seine-Maritime region.         Her parents were Prince Pedro de Alcantara of Orléans and Bragana, Prince of Grão Pará, and Dona Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil. The family having been exiled from Brazil, the younger Isabel was educated in France.         The countess first met her future husband while still a child. Their engagement was made public in 1930 in Belgium, to which his family had long been banished. For political reasons, the wedding took place in Palermo the next year, with other European royalty and throngs of French royalists in attendance.         At the time, Henri's father headed what many French monarchists still considered the royal house of France. The royal family of Bourbon had been driven from France by law in 1886 and were forbidden even to visit until 1950.         The couple began married life in Belgium, where the count ran two newspapers. From 1932 to 1948, the countess bore five sons and six daughters, most of whom married into their own social class. Two of the sons died, in 1960 and 1983.         The couple lived at various times in Brazil, Morocco, Spain and Portugal before France revoked the 1886 Law of Exile in 1950. Then, living just outside Paris, the count ventured into politics, proclaiming his loyalty to democracy, and she took her place in Paris society.         The countess wrote two books of memoirs as well as some biographical and historical writings about her family.         Correction:  July 31, 2003, Thursday  An obituary of the Countess of Paris on July 14 misspelled the English-language version of her name. She was Isabel of Orléans and Braganza, not Bragana.       
         Jinx Falkenburg, one of America's highest paid cover-girl models during World War II, and later, with her husband, Tex McCrary, a pioneer talk-show star on both radio and television, died on Wednesday in Manhasset, N.Y. She was 84 and lived in the nearby village of Mill Neck.         She died at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, a Long Island hospital of which she and her husband were among the founders, said her son Kevin McCrary. She and Mr. McCrary had lived apart for many years but remained friends. He died on July 29.         At one point in the 1950's, ''Tex and Jinx,'' as they were known in virtually every American household, had two radio programs, a five-day-a-week television show and a syndicated column in The New York Herald Tribune. They were among the first to refine the format that came to be called the talk show.         In addition to having a successful broadcasting career, Miss Falkenburg was long active in raising money for the Republican Party and helped her husband when he worked to persuade Dwight D. Eisenhower to run for the presidency in 1952.         She was born Eugenia Lincoln Falkenburg on Jan. 21, 1919, in Barcelona, Spain, one of three children of Eugene Falkenburg, an engineer, and Marguerite Crooks Falkenburg, an accomplished amateur tennis player. Mr. Falkenburg had a series of assignments in Spain, where he worked on electrifying railroads. The nickname Jinx was given by her mother. The name stuck.         Soon after Miss Falkenburg was born, the family moved to Chile and then, in her teens, to Los Angeles, where she went to public schools. She left Hollywood High School in 1935 to pursue acting and modeling.         She had already attracted the attention of a talent scout from Warner Brothers who had seen her play tennis. She was signed to a studio contract and, since she was fluent in Spanish, was given Spanish-language movies distributed only in Latin America.         Two years later, she met Paul Hesse, a professional photographer whose work appeared regularly in The American Magazine. He called her ''the most charming, most vital personality I have ever had the pleasure to photograph.'' In August of 1937, her face appeared on the cover, and that quickly led to invitations from more than five dozen other magazines to showcase her hazel eyes and lithe body.         At about this time she was sent to Honolulu to work on a film. In her hotel, she stepped on what she thought was a secure balcony, fell through the floor and landed in the dining room below. In a hospital for her injuries, she was assigned a room near one occupied by Al Jolson, who was convalescing. They were introduced and it led to Jolson's offering her a part as a cowgirl in his musical ''Hold On to Your Hat,'' which opened at the Shubert Theater in New York in 1940.         She met Mr. McCrary, who was then a writer for The Daily Mirror, when he was sent to interview her.         She was regarded as one of the most beautiful women in America. The New York World-Telegram observed that Miss Falkenburg's photogenic face had probably appeared in more different places in this country than that of any other woman around.         In 1941, Liebmann Brewery, the maker of Rheingold beer, decided it might sell a lot more of the brand if each year it bestowed on some attractive young woman the title Miss Rheingold. Miss Falkenburg was the first. It was a plum for any model, since, for starters, it put her name and face in every store in New York that sold beer.         Now she was asked to appear in Hollywood productions made for distribution in the United States. Her acting ability, however, did not attract the attention of the critics, who generally gave her films poor reviews. Among those 1940's movies for Columbia Pictures were ''Sing for Your Supper,'' ''Sweetheart of the Fleet,'' ''Lucky Legs,'' ''Laugh Your Blues Away,'' ''She Has What It Takes,'' ''Two Señoritas From Chicago'' and ''Cover Girl.''         During the war, she spent considerable time entertaining Allied troops, and in 1945 received the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal for her work. When Mr. McCrary returned from the war after service as a photographer and public relations officer for the Army Air Corps, he courted Miss Falkenburg and they were married in June 1945.         In 1946, Miss Falkenburg and Mr. McCrary pooled their considerable powers of persuasion and talked radio station WEAF in New York into giving them their own show. It was broadcast on weekday mornings and quickly became popular with the public and the critics because it tackled issues that were then controversial, including venereal disease, the United Nations and the atom bomb. The program was called ''Hi Jinx,'' and Miss Falkenburg, who had no experience as an interviewer, was coached by Mr. McCrary, who also wrote most of the show himself.         They made their television debut the next year in ''At Home,'' which was broadcast by NBC and showed them interviewing their guests at home. They also had another television program, called ''The Swift Home Service Club,'' in which they offered household hints and conducted chatty interviews.         Meanwhile, a second radio program, ''Meet Tex and Jinx,'' achieved such a following that it became a summer replacement for the popular ''Duffy's Tavern'' in both 1947 and 1948.         Tex and Jinx continued their work in television and also began to write a daily column for The New York Herald Tribune, called ''New York Close-Up.'' That led to yet another television show of the same name, on NBC. Miss Falkenburg's biography, ''Jinx,'' was published in 1951.         By the middle 1950's, Tex McCrary and Jinx Falkenburg were conducting their talk show from Peacock Alley in the Waldorf-Astoria.         Miss Falkenburg and Mr. McCrary were friends of John Hay Whitney, who was chairman of the finance committee of the Republican Party. At Mr. Whitney's request, Miss Falkenburg became head of the women's division in 1954.         Miss Falkenburg and Mr. McCrary had two children, John Reagan McCrary 3d of Manhattan and Kevin Jock McCrary of Mill Neck. Both survive them.         After the husband-and-wife talk show eventually ran its course, Mr. McCrary had his own radio shows for a time. He and Miss Falkenburg separated in the 1980's. In later years, she lived quietly on Long Island, serving on the board of the hospital the couple had helped found and working on a planned second autobiography.         Correction:  August 29, 2003, Friday  Because of an editing error, an obituary yesterday about Jinx Falkenburg, a model and early talk-show star, reversed the places of residence of her sons. John Reagan McCrary 3d lives in Mill Neck, N.Y., and Kevin Jock McCrary lives in Manhattan.       
         Mary Viscountess Eccles, a bibliophile who built up what is widely considered the world's finest collection of rare books and manuscripts relating to Samuel Johnson and his biographer and friend, James Boswell, died on Aug. 26 at her home, Four Oakes Farm, in Somerset County, N.J. She was 91.         Lady Eccles, the American widow of Viscount Eccles, a British politician, businessman and bibliophile who once headed the British Library in London, was first drawn to the world of the Elizabethan theater but later switched her interest and the focus of her collecting to Johnson and Boswell and their circle.         She and her first husband, Donald Frizell Hyde, a New York lawyer, acquired thousands of books and manuscripts relating to these two towering literary figures of the 18th century.         Treasures stored in the huge fireproof library they built at Four Oakes Farm include about 800 letters from Johnson -- about 80 percent of all those known to have survived -- as well as works and papers from the important A. Edward Newton collection of Johnson material, which Lady Eccles, then Mary Hyde, acquired around 1940.         The library also houses the Johnson material from the collection of James Boswell's papers found at Malahide Castle in Ireland, which she bought from the American collector Col. Ralph H. Isham at the end of World War II; Boswell's guestbook from his home at Auchinleck, Scotland; Johnson's diaries for the years 1765 to about 1784; the private journal of Hester Thrale, Johnson's great friend and benefactor; and a collection known as the R. B. Adam Library Relating to Dr. Samuel Johnson and His Era, which she bought from the Adam family of Buffalo in 1948, and which was then regarded as the best in existence.         Under the name Mary Hyde, she also wrote a number of books about her interests. In 1949, Columbia University published her doctoral thesis, ''Playwriting for Elizabethans, 1600-1605.'' In 1958 she, her first husband and E. J. McAdam Jr. edited Volume I of the Yale edition of the works of Samuel Johnson, ''Diaries, Prayers and Annals.''         In 1972 she published ''The Impossible Friendship: Boswell and Mrs. Thrale'' (Harvard), a study of Boswell's relationship with the woman who befriended Johnson. This was followed in 1975 by ''The Thrales of Streatham Park'' (Harvard), an account of Mrs. Thrale and her family.         She was awarded honorary degrees by American and British universities, including Brown, the University of Birmingham (England), the University of Massachusetts and Union College.         She was the first woman elected to the Roxburghe Club, an English association of bibliophiles, and one of the first to join the Grolier Club, another bibliophile's group, in New York City; she was vice president from 1982 to 1992.         Lady Eccles financed her collecting largely from her own family fortune. She was born Mary Morley Crapo in Detroit on July 12 1912. Her family name was derived from crapaud, the French for toad, which had been the name bestowed by Cape Cod natives on a French ancestor of hers who washed up there in 1680. But the family prospered, becoming rich from interests in cement, barges and timber, and that allowed Lady Eccles to indulge her passion for book collecting.         She earned a bachelor's degree at Vassar in 1934, a master's from Columbia in 1935 and a doctorate there in 1945. In 1939 she married Mr. Hyde, and in 1943 they bought Four Oakes Farm, which was her home for the rest of her life.         Lady Eccles described in an essay first published in The Vassar Alumnae Magazine in 1960 how she and Mr. Hyde were drawn to book collecting when they visited a rare book exhibition in Detroit and realized for the first time that books of this kind were not all locked up in libraries but available for purchase.         They also learned some of the risks. The three Shakespeare quartos they bought on that occasion turned out to be defective, Lady Eccles wrote, while a document with the purported signature of Queen Elizabeth I proved to be a fake.         From time to time Lady Eccles encountered resistance to her large-scale purchases of remaining Johnson and Boswell memorabilia in Britain. She had trouble with a patriotic Scottish customs officer when she took five trunks of Boswell papers from Colonel Isham's collection aboard the Queen Mary at Southampton. In 1968, Hugh Mainwaring, who owned the journal Mrs. Thrale kept from 1766 to 1778, refused to sell her the manuscript privately, though she subsequently got it at a Sotheby's auction.         Her first husband died in 1966. In 1984 she married Lord Eccles, who died in 1999. She is survived by two stepsons and a stepdaughter, all of whom live in England: Viscount Eccles of Mowlton, Yorkshire; Simon Eccles of London; and Polly Landsdown of Great Coxwell, Oxfordshire.         Correction:  September 9, 2003, Tuesday  An obituary on Aug. 30 about Mary Viscountess Eccles, a leading bibliophile and collector of material on Samuel Johnson, misspelled part of the name of her home in Somerset County, N.J., where she died. It is Four Oaks Farm, not Oakes.         Correction:  September 25, 2003, Thursday  An obituary on Aug. 30 about Mary Viscountess Eccles, a leading bibliophile and collector of material on Samuel Johnson, misstated the name of the New York University professor who collaborated with her and her first husband in editing a volume of Johnson's works. He was E. L. McAdam Jr., not E. J.       
         Lady Diana Mosley, one of the famous Mitford sisters and a glamorous 1930's socialite who scandalously abandoned her husband, embraced fascism and married Sir Oswald Mosley, leader of the British Union of Fascists, died in Paris on Monday, her family said. She was 93.         A spokeswoman for her sister, the Duchess of Devonshire, told the BBC, ''We can confirm that she died peacefully, but we cannot say any more than that.''         Lady Mosley's stubborn fascism and her unrepentant admiration for Hitler -- he and Josef Goebbels were guests at her wedding to Sir Oswald, in Berlin in 1936 -- made her a figure of hate to the British during World War II, and to some extent for the rest of her life. Judged a danger to her country, she spent two and a half years in Holloway Prison in London while war raged on the Continent.         After the war, she and Sir Oswald, who also served time in Holloway, moved to Orsay, Paris, where they lived happily, and only partly in disgrace, for the rest of their lives (he died in 1980). Although shunned by the British establishment -- British ambassadors to France were instructed not to invite her to the embassy, for instance -- Lady Mosley presided over a beautifully decorated house, Temple de la Gloire, where she gardened, wrote, read, gave interviews, kept up on London literary gossip and entertained an endless stream of glittery visitors who were, inevitably, thoroughly enchanted by her quick wit, sparkling appearance, and sly sense of humor.         She was one of the few people ever to maintain simultaneous friendships with Hitler and Churchill.         ''There were so many paradoxes about this most beautiful, most intelligent, and most beguiling of the celebrated Mitford sisters,'' the novelist and critic A. N. Wilson, a friend of Lady Mosley, wrote in The Daily Telegraph. Also in The Daily Telegraph, the historian Andrew Roberts described succumbing, however unwillingly, ''to the full force of her Mitfordesque charm,'' even as Lady Mosley calmly announced that although Hitler ''was to blame for the extermination of the Jews,'' he was also perhaps the most attractive man she had ever met.         Lady Diana Mosley was born the Honorable Diana Mitford in 1910, the third of the six Mitford girls (a brother, Tom, was killed in World War II). They were fabled for their wit and luminous looks -- each one seemed to glitter more brightly than the next -- and their eccentric upbringing was immortalized in various books, including the novels ''The Pursuit of Love,'' ''Love in a Cold Climate,'' and others by Nancy Mitford; and ''Hons and Rebels,'' a memoir by Jessica Mitford. Their father was Lord Redesdale, a blustery country aristocrat with little money and old-fashioned views, fond of outdoor pursuits and famously bad-tempered about the outside society for which his daughters longed.         They found it, in wildly different ways. Nancy, an intimate of Evelyn Waugh, became a hugely successful novelist and essayist and ardent anti-fascist. Jessica became a Communist, running away from home to join Esmond Romilly, a wastrel nephew of Churchill, who had gone to Spain to work as a journalist in the Spanish Civil War (she later settled in the United States and wrote ''The American Way of Death,'' a brilliantly acerbic analysis of the American funeral industry, among other things).         Unity, another sister, became a fanatical fascist, befriended Hitler and was so distraught when Britain entered World War II that she shot herself in the head, botching the suicide attempt but suffering extensive brain damage. Deborah, another sister, married the Duke of Devonshire, one of the best catches in all of British bachelorhood.         In a family of dazzling girls, Diana dazzled perhaps the brightest. ''She was the nearest thing to Botticelli's Venus that I have ever seen,'' wrote James Lees-Milne, a family friend; Evelyn Waugh, who dedicated ''Vile Bodies'' to her, said that her beauty ''ran through the room like a peal of bells.'' At 18, she became engaged after a few weeks' acquaintance to the brewing heir Bryan Guinness, a match that seemed objectionable only to her mother -- he was ''so frightfully rich,'' Lady Redesdale said.         The two quickly had two sons. With her beauty and wit, and his money, the Guinnesses became the center of young London society, but Diana wanted more. In 1932, she left her husband for Oswald Mosley, the strikingly attractive leader of the fledgling British Union of Fascists, a bold step, not least because he was still married (his wife conveniently died, of peritonitis, the following year).         Diana threw herself into her lover's cause, hoping to effect amity between fascist Germany and Britain. After the two were married, in 1936, Diana Mosley had two more sons, and devoted herself to raising them. She was arrested and jailed in 1940, when the second was just a baby. Though the prison years were miserable, she tried to make light of them after the fact, as she did about her exile in Paris.         ''The story about us being pariahs and all that, it's all nonsense really,'' she told an interviewer last year. ''I've never had rudeness or disagreeableness ever. At meetings there were rows with Communists and so on. If you met the Communists at dinner, you wouldn't have a row.''         Sir Oswald Mosley, a hereditary baronet, died in 1980, and Lady Mosley never remarried. She reconciled with her sister Nancy, nursing her through the cancer that led to Nancy's death in 1973, and made peace with some, but by no means all, of her other relatives. Through it all, she was always impeccably dressed, always a gracious hostess, and always intellectually vigorous, contributing book reviews to The Times of London, the Evening Standard, and the Spectator, among other publications, and answering frankly and unflinchingly when interviewers and historians made pilgrimages to Paris to ask her about the old days.         She is survived by a far-flung extended family, including the Duchess of Devonshire, her last surviving sister; four sons, two by each of her husbands; and a large number of grandchildren and great-grandchildren.         She remained passionate about Sir Oswald, the love of her life, to the end. ''He appeared to me then as he does still, the cleverest, most balanced, and most honest of all English politicians,'' she said in her memoir, ''A Life of Contrasts.'' Nor did she ever fully denounce Hitler -- she was too stubbornly loyal to her beliefs and her behavior for that, her friends believe -- although she deplored his excesses.         ''We all know that he was a monster, that he was cruel and did terrible things,'' she said. ''But that doesn't alter the fact that he was obviously an interesting figure.''         She added, in an interview in 2000: ''I was very fond of him. Very, very fond.''         Correction:  September 9, 2003, Tuesday  An obituary on Aug. 14 about Diana Mosley, the British aristocrat who was a staunch supporter of Hitler and fascism, referred incompletely to Esmond Romilly, who had married one of her sisters, Jessica Mitford. Although Mr. Romilly was a rebellious young man of privilege, he also became a published writer and an ardent anti-fascist who fought against Franco in Spain and, while serving in the Royal Canadian Air Force, died in 1941, at 23, in a bombing raid against Nazi Germany.       
         IT'S a beautiful day in the neighborhood  actually, that 2003 meteorological rarity, the sun, is shining -- and the uninitiated might imagine that this would give Kathy Bronander an easy sale. ''People think that because it's a sunny day, a Realtor can drive people around and sell a house, just like that,'' she said. ''Well. What an idea.''         For years now, the fantasy of an easy-money windfall in the real-estate game has collided with Darwinian reality in this town of 38,977. More than 600 licensed Realtors in the area have battled for some 200 salable houses thus far this year.         The resulting algorithm was succinctly stated by Mrs. Bronander, who has been selling houses here for 17 years: ''Properties are going off the market faster than they are coming on.''         Montclair may not be the most competitive environment on the face of the earth -- network reality-television scheduling comes to mind -- but the Kathy Bronander to-do list is hardly for the faint of heart.         Though recently mortgage rates have been inching up, supplicants have not been deterred, and are still beating down the doors. This, despite the proliferating cut-rate online brokers who are badmouthing traditional real estate cadres. So far, the discounters haven't made much of a dent in the Montclair market, where clients expect so much personal service.         According to several real estate brokers, homes in Montclair have appreciated 100 percent in the last five years. Desirable houses draw multiple bids, and Mrs. Bronander, who works for Schweppe & Company, has had clients competing against as many as eight other suitors.         She wistfully recalled the quaintness of the 1980's when ''you'd take people out, show them houses, and there was a leisurely process of negotiation.'' Couples once had the audacity to offer less than the suggested asking price.         Just to raise the stakes, her husband, Burt, is a Realtor for a rival company, Burgdorff ERA, and strict regulations forbid the couple from talking about deals, or bringing home office gossip, which could create unfair advantages. ''Since we can't talk about real estate, Burt watches TV and I read a book,'' she said.         Their feisty partnership is totally Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn, since they live separate real-estate lives. Although their employers are competitive, husband and wife have never duked it out for a single house -- ''so far,'' said Mr. Bronander, with a gleam in his eye.         House-wrangling is very emotional. ''Through the weeks and months, you develop such a close relationship with people when you're selling a house,'' Mrs. Bronander said. After the deal is done, ''it's almost like coming to the end of a great book. There is an emptiness. But losing? It's hard on our clients. And hard on us.''         Mr. Bronander has been there: ''When you get the call that says you're not going to get the house, you start to cry and pour yourself a Scotch.''         Empathic, poised and ever ready to defuse discomfort with easy wit, Mrs. Bronander has seen it all. There are the couples who make an appointment and don't show up. The window-shoppers who want to spend a pleasant afternoon and have no intention of buying. The transactions that fall apart in attorney review.         There was also the couple that insisted on a six-bedroom center-hall colonial that needed work. Mrs. Bronander showed them dozens of properties over a year, until the couple suddenly chose a two-bedroom ranch in perfect condition.         These days most of their customers are repeaters, who also send along friends and family members. One of these will certainly be Rabbi Michael Monson of the Congregation Shomrei Emunath; Mrs. Bronander advised him when he was moving from Philadelphia to lead the congregation.         ''Kathy inspires instant confidence, because you have a sense that she cares beyond the sale or the purchase of the property,'' he said, adding: ''And she's a strategist. She told us to add $200 to our offer so it wouldn't be an even bid -- and we got the house.''         The Bronanders' client base has grown for many reasons, not the least of which is that, after putting their five children through the school system, they know practically everyone in town.         AND they are involved. Mrs. Bronander is past president of the Montclair Lions Club and the Mercier Club, and a sustaining member of the Junior League. Mr. Bronander is past president of the Commonwealth Club and, until 1986, managed the Wedgwood, a storied but now-defunct cafeteria.         These days, e-mail, cell phones and pagers make Mrs. Bronander available 24/7 to her clients' demands. Twelve-hour days are routine on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.         The effort has its reward. Recently Mrs. Bronander sold two $1 million houses, and most years she has had more than $3 million in sales; for three years she has won the silver award from the New Jersey Association of Realtors: 20 properties sold for a total of $7.5 million.         Still, Mrs. Bronander's last vacation was three days -- in March, when she ran up a $150 phone bill from South Carolina. ''I've never calculated my hourly wage,'' she said. ''I'm afraid to.''         PUBLIC LIVES  Correction:  August 16, 2003, Saturday  A quotation yesterday serving as the picture caption for the Public Lives profile of Kathy Bronander, a real estate agent in Montclair, N.J., carried an erroneous attribution. As the article reported, it was Burt Bronander, the agent's husband, not she herself, who said, ''When you get the call that says you're not going to get the house, you start to cry and pour yourself a Scotch.''       
         Roxie C. Laybourne, whose scientific investigations into bird collisions with airplanes helped start forensic ornithology and enabled engineers to develop aircraft capable of withstanding such accidents, died on Aug. 7 at her farm in Manassas, Va. She was 92.         In 1960, when a plane crashed taking off from Logan Airport in Boston, killing all 62 people aboard, Ms. Laybourne, then a scientist at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, helped investigators conclude that the cause was a flock of starlings caught in one of its engines.         Having only charred remains to work with, she developed a novel way to remove oil and gasoline from bits of feathers while keeping them suitable for microscopic examination. Using a microscope, she could then pinpoint minute structural characteristics and identify the bird species or family based on the feathers.         Over the next decades, Ms. Laybourne helped identify thousands of birds involved in collisions with commercial and military aircraft. Her work gave plane manufacturers information for designing engines that could continue to fly after ingesting the birds, and it helped ornithologists create bird management programs to prevent flocks from gathering near airports.         As a top expert in her field, Ms. Laybourne helped the Federal Bureau of Investigation use feathers as evidence. In one homicide, she matched the down in a pillow that was used to silence the murder weapon to traces of down that were found on the defendant's trouser cuff.         In other cases, she helped catch poachers by being able to identify invisible remnants of feathers from endangered birds on the illegal hunters.         ''We depended on her,'' said Doug Deedrick, a special agent with the F.B.I. research laboratory in Quantico, Va., who trained under Ms. Laybourne in the late 70's. ''She was regarded as probably the foremost feather identification expert in the world.         ''She developed schemes, techniques and procedures for feather analysis and identification that are still in use today. Her legacy is the experts she trained who continue her work here and at the Smithsonian.''         Born in Fayetteville, N.C., in 1910, Roxie Collie Laybourne earned her bachelor's degree from Meredith College in Raleigh and a master's degree at George Washington University. She worked for the National Fisheries Laboratory in Beaufort, N.C., and the North Carolina State Museum before joining the Smithsonian in 1944, where she worked for 44 years.         After her official retirement, she became a consultant for the National Fish and Wildlife Forensic Laboratory, helping the authorities there investigate illegal bird hunting.         Ms. Laybourne's first marriage, to Philip Simpson, ended in divorce. Her second husband, Edgar G. Laybourne, died in 1966.         She is survived by two sons, Clarence Grimmer Simpson of Roswell, N.M., and Robert Laybourne of Manassas; a stepdaughter, Phyllis Hallman of Fairfax County, Va.; four brothers; four sisters; two grandchildren; and four great-  grandchildren.       
         Connie Reeves, who was very likely America's oldest cowgirl, died in San Antonio on Aug. 17, 12 days after she was thrown from her horse, Dr Pepper. She was 101.         She was riding her favorite horse, a 28-year-old paint, on the morning of Aug. 5 when Dr Pepper threw her over its head. Her neck was broken, but she was not paralyzed, The Kerrville (Tex.) Daily Times reported. The Associated Press said she died of cardiac arrest.         Meg Clark, owner of Camp Waldemar in the Texas Hill Country, where Mrs. Reeves taught riding for 67 years, said she had been riding more this year than in previous years and was delighted that Dr Pepper remained so spirited.         ''That was how she wanted to live her life, and that was how she wanted to end it,'' Ms. Clark said on Wednesday. ''She wanted to be on horseback.''         As a baby, Mrs. Reeves was photographed on a horse -- as well as on a cow, something she could never quite explain -- and went on to manage a ranch and teach about 30,000 girls to ride over the years at a summer camp. She could herd steers, shear sheep, kill rattlesnakes and cook for hungry cowhands.         At first she did not think she deserved to be inducted into the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame in 1997, but then decided she had as much right as the next lady, given the things she had done and the things she knew.         She knew, for example, that a horse could smell fear. When she ended up with one leg shorter than the other after falling from a horse, she did the sensible thing: she had the heel of one cowboy boot raised.         Mrs. Reeves's greatest fame came last year when Justice Sandra Day O'Connor of the United States Supreme Court was inducted into the Cowgirl Hall of Fame in Fort Worth. Reporters could not resist interviewing the hall's oldest member, whom the event's organizers were more than willing to make available.         After all, a quotation from Mrs. Reeves, ''Always saddle your own horse,'' had almost become the hall's motto. Liz Smith began a gossip column by suggesting, ''It's not a bad motto, even if you are just getting into your Mercedes.''         Many things Mrs. Reeves did seemed to make history, particularly in Texas.         She was one of the first women to study law at the University of Texas, and she started one of the state's first girls' drill teams, a movement that grew into a Texas passion. The 10,000-acre ranch she and her husband managed was owned by Lyndon B. Johnson.         In 1998, Mrs. Reeves won the Chester A. Reynolds Award for major contributions to the Western way of life from the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, one of two women to do so.         Constance Douglas was born on Sept. 26, 1901, in Eagle Pass, Tex., on the Mexican border. She swam in the Rio Grande and rode horses with cowboys. Her grandfather gave her her first horse when she was 5. The family moved to San Antonio when she was 16.         Her father was a lawyer, and her mother was so genteel that she refused to go to the grocer's without gloves and a hat.         Mrs. Reeves graduated from Texas Women's University in Denton as a speech major and then attended the University of Texas School of Law, but left to take a job because her family was short of money in the Depression. She taught at two San Antonio high schools. At one, Thomas Jefferson High, she founded a drill team called the Lassos, which is still in existence.         She also started a riding stable to teach city boys and girls how to ride and care for horses. Although the stables were successful, she accepted a position as riding instructor at Camp Waldemar in 1936 for $50 a summer. She eventually taught Western and English riding styles to the granddaughters of her original students.         She came to the conclusion that horses respond best to women.         ''The harsh voices and rough bark of boys and men seem to frighten horses,'' she wrote several weeks before her death in a script for a video about riding. ''The same horse that refused to take the bit in its mouth will accept it from the more gentle hands of a girl.''         At the camp she met Jack Reeves, a former rodeo star, trick rider and keeper of the camp's horses. They married in 1942; he died in 1985. They had no children, and she left no immediate survivors.         ''I'm sure glad I don't have grandchildren,'' she said in an interview with The Associated Press last year. ''The world today, it's disturbed.''         The cowgirl found her own peace on a horse.         ''I still ride alone,'' Mrs. Reeves said in an interview with National Public Radio last year. ''Sometimes I'll just get on the horse and go down to the river. We'll just ride up and watch a little baby fawn nursing or watch the birds in a nest.         ''As long as I'm alive, I'm going to be trying to ride a horse.''       
         Althea Gibson emerged in the tennis world of the 1950's as a most unlikely queen of the lawns of Wimbledon and Forest Hills.         In 1950 she became the first black to compete in the United States nationals. She won 56 tournaments, including five Grand Slam singles titles -- the United States nationals and Wimbledon twice, in 1957 and 1958, and the French championship in 1956.         What made that especially remarkable was her background as a rough-hewn product of Harlem, a chronic truant and an eighth-grade dropout.         She had grown up far removed from the two genteel worlds of tennis: the white country club set and the network of black doctors, lawyers and other professionals who pursued tennis on private courts of their own.         Gibson owed much of her success to that very network of black tennis enthusiasts and to a geographic coincidence.         Althea Gibson, born in a sharecropper's shack in Silver, S.C., on Aug. 25, 1927, was brought to New York by her parents when she was a few months old. By chance, the family moved into an apartment on a West 143rd Street block between Lenox and Seventh Avenues that was a designated play street.         When the volunteers from the Police Athletic League closed the block to traffic and set up their recreation equipment, the spot they chose to mark off as a paddle tennis court was right in front of the Gibsons' front stoop.         A natural athlete who excelled in virtually every sport she tried, Gibson took up paddle tennis at 9 and won a citywide championship when she was 12.         In 1941 Buddy Walker, a Harlem bandleader and part-time P.A.L. supervisor, bought her two rackets and introduced her to friends at the Cosmopolitan Tennis Club, a predominantly black club that played on courts on 149th Street just a few blocks away but a world removed from the neighborhood she had known. Gibson was coached there by Fred Johnson, the one-armed club pro, and taken up by the club's members, who taught her some more important lessons.         As she put it in her 1958 autobiography, ''I Always Wanted to Be Somebody,'' the club attracted ''the highest class'' of Harlem residents, people, she noted, who ''had rigid ideas about what was socially acceptable.''         Those ideas were alien to her own experience.         ''I'm ashamed to say,'' she wrote, ''that I was still living pretty wild.''         Gibson would come home late (sometimes the next day) and her father, a garage attendant, would beat her. But Gibson saw her father as merely a stern disciplinarian, not abusive.         Gibson made a lifelong friendship when she approached her idol, the boxing champion Sugar Ray Robinson, in a bowling alley. Sympathetic to her dream of a career in music, he bought her a saxophone.         Finally, to escape her father's wrath, she sought refuge in a Catholic home for girls and eventually received a welfare grant to get her own apartment while she worked at menial jobs.         But it was tennis that gripped her interest. In 1942 she won her first tournament, the New York State girls' championship, sponsored by the American Tennis Association, which had been organized in 1916 by black players as an alternative to the United States Lawn Tennis Association.         In 1946, when she lost in the final of her first A.T.A. women's championship, she caught the eye of two men who changed her life and altered the course of tennis, Hubert A. Eaton of Wilmington, N.C., and R. Walter Johnson of Lynchburg, Va.         These men, both physicians and leaders of a cadre of black enthusiasts determined to crack the racial barriers of mainstream tennis, saw Gibson's potential and became her sponsors.         They arranged for Gibson to live with Eaton and his wife during the school year, practicing on his court and attending high school, and to spend the summer traveling on the A.T.A. circuit with Johnson, who later performed a similar service for Arthur Ashe.         She was 19 when she started at Wilmington Industrial High School, but finished in three years, graduating 10th in her class, and enrolled as a scholarship student at Florida A&M, receiving a degree at 25.         She also flourished on the court, winning the first of her 10 straight A.T.A. national championships in 1947.         In 1949, a year after Dr. Benjamin Weir had become the first black to play in a United States Lawn Tennis Association title event -- the 1948 National Indoor Championships -- Gibson took her first steps beyond the world of the black tennis circuit, making it to the semifinals of the Eastern Indoor Championships and then to the semifinals of the national championships.         The next step proved harder. Even after she had won the 1950 Eastern Indoor Championship and a clamor had begun to let her play in the National Grass Court Championships at Forest Hills, the precursor of the United States Open, the powers of tennis seemed to close ranks to keep her out.         To qualify for an invitation to the 1950 nationals, she was required to first make a name for herself at one of the major preliminary grass-court events. But no invitations were forthcoming.         Alice Marble, a former champion, rallied support for Gibson. ''If tennis is a game for ladies and gentlemen,'' she wrote in a letter to American Lawn Tennis magazine, ''it's time we acted a little more like gentlepeople and less like sanctimonious hypocrites.''         Finally, Gibson received an invitation to the Eastern Grass Court Championships at the Orange Lawn Tennis Club in South Orange, N.J. She made it only as far as the second round, but that was enough to win a bid to Forest Hills.         On Aug. 28, 1950, three years after Jackie Robinson had broken the color barrier in major league baseball, Gibson became the first black player to compete in the national tennis championship. Taking her place on a remote court at the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, Queens, she dispatched Barbara Knapp of England, 6-2, 6-2.         The next day, she faced the Wimbledon champion, Louise Brough. After losing the first set, 6-1, Gibson took the second, 6-3, then fell behind by 3-0 in the third before beginning a surge that brought repeated roars from 2,000 hardy spectators who ignored the first peals of thunder and flashes of lightning of a gathering storm.         Gibson took a lead of 7-6 and was on the verge of victory over her visibly spent opponent. But the rains came, the match was suspended, and when it resumed the next day, Brough won three straight games to win the match.         The 5-foot-10 1/2 Gibson gained the attention of the tennis public. A powerful if inconsistent player, the lean and muscular young woman had a dominating serve, and her long, graceful reach often stunned opponents.         Over the next half-dozen years, Gibson became a fixture on the tennis circuit, playing Wimbledon for the first time in 1951 and earning a ranking as high as No. 7 in the United States.         But Gibson became so disenchanted with her failure to break through to the top that she considered abandoning tennis and entering the Army.         In the fall of 1955, the State Department selected her for a goodwill tennis tour of Asia and the Far East, and the experience inspired her game. In 1956 she won 16 of her first 18 tournaments, including the French championship at Roland Garros, her first title at a Grand Slam event.         But once again victory in the singles championships eluded her at Wimbledon and Forest Hills, although she had been favored to win both. Gibson did team with Angela Buxton to win the Wimbledon doubles in 1956. She won in doubles again in 1957, with Darlene Hard, and in 1958, with Maria Bueno.         After losing to Shirley Fry of the United States in the singles final of the Australian Open in 1957, she did not lose another match all year. Passing up the clay court distraction of the French championship to concentrate on tuning up on grass courts in England, she again entered Wimbledon as the favorite and defeated Hard in the final.         ''At last,'' she said, ''at last,'' as she accepted the trophy from Queen Elizabeth II.         She later wrote in her autobiography: ''Shaking hands with the Queen of England was a long way from being forced to sit in the colored section of the bus going into downtown Wilmington, N.C.''         Upon returning home, Gibson was given a ticker-tape parade up Broadway, a banquet at the Waldorf-Astoria and a celebration on West 143rd Street.         She told friends and supporters, ''This victory belongs to you,'' but she chaffed at efforts to make her a symbol of black achievement.         When a reporter asked if she was proud to be compared to Jackie Robinson as an outstanding representative of her race, Gibson replied: ''No. I don't consider myself to be a representative of my people. I am thinking of me and nobody else.''         Having won Wimbledon, Gibson rolled through the national championship at Forest Hills. In the final, she defeated Brough, who had eliminated her in her first national seven years before.         After being named the outstanding female athlete of the year in a poll of Associated Press sports editors, Gibson repeated her Wimbledon and Forest Hills singles victories in 1958, and was named the outstanding female athlete again. Then, under pressure from her family to make some money from her talent, she announced her retirement from amateur tennis.         At a time when the professional game was little more than a sideshow, she had little trouble winning the pro title and went on an exhibition tour with the Harlem Globetrotters, playing tennis at halftime.         In the early 1960's she became the first black player to compete on the women's golf tour, but she never won a tournament. Gibson, who was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame at Newport, R.I., later held various athletic posts in New Jersey state government. A resident of East Orange, she had served as its recreation director.         Gibson was married twice, to William Darben and Sidney Llewellyn. She had no children.         When another black woman, Zina Garrison, made it to the Wimbledon final in 1990 before losing to Martina Navratilova, Gibson was there to cheer her on, but she soon receded from the limelight once again with health and financial problems.         ''It was truly an inspiration for me to watch her overcome adversity,'' Billie Jean King, who was 13 when she first say Gibson play, told The Associated Press yesterday. ''Her road to success was a challenging one, but I never saw her back down.''         Robert McG. Thomas Jr., a reporter for The New York Times, died in 2000.         Correction:  October 2, 2003, Thursday  An obituary on Monday about Althea Gibson, the first black competitor in the United State tennis nationals and the winner of five Grand Slam titles, gave an incorrect surname for the first black player in a United States Lawn Tennis Association title event. He was Dr. Reginald Weir, not Benjamin.       
         Susan Chilcott, a leading British soprano who had a winning Metropolitan Opera debut last year as Helena in Britten's ''Midsummer Night's Dream'' and received glowing reviews last June for her Royal Opera at Covent Garden debut as Lisa in Tchaikovsky's ''Queen of Spades,'' opposite Plácido Domingo, died on Thursday at her home in Timsbury, near Bath. She was 40.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         Ms. Chilcott, who began singing lessons at 6, attracted attention early in her career with her warm, dusky soprano and her stately and compelling stage presence. After appearing with the Scottish Opera, Opera North, the Welsh National Opera and the English National Opera, she made her first appearance outside Britain in 1994 at the Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie in Brussels, where she played Ellen Orford in a new production of Britten's ''Peter Grimes.''         There she became a protégée of the conductor Antonio Pappano, now the music director at Covent Garden, who said he was devastated by the news of her death. ''It is rare to come across an opera star who is as good an actress as she is a singer,'' Mr. Pappano said in The Times of London on Thursday.         Among the other roles she sang with the Brussels company were the Composer in Strauss's ''Ariadne auf Naxos,'' Hermione in the 1999 world premiere of Philippe Boesmans's ''Wintermärchen'' and Desdemona in Verdi's ''Otello,'' a part she also performed in a new production of that opera at the Glyndebourne Festival in July 2001. She made her United States debut in 1996 as Donna Elvira in Mozart's ''Don Giovanni'' at the Santa Fe Opera.         Ms. Chilcott's cancer was diagnosed in 2000. After surgery and chemotherapy, she had to withdraw the next year from a production of Prokofiev's ''War and Peace'' at the English National Opera. But as her condition improved, she continued to perform and accept important appearances, including the Met debut.         Last summer she made news during a performance in the ''Queen of Spades'' at Covent Garden when a candle set fire to the train of her dress. Absorbed in her singing, she did not hear the shouts from members of the audience and was startled when a member of the staff rushed onstage with a fire extinguisher.         Ms. Chilcott is survived by her husband, David Sigall, who was also her manager, and her 4-year-old son from an earlier relationship, Hugh.         She had been scheduled to sing Ellen Orford in the forthcoming season at Covent Garden and had also discussed future roles at the Met, though her illness prevented her from making any commitments.       
         Judith Arango Henderson, a design expert, curator and columnist whose Miami retail store, Arango Inc., was one of the first to specialize in midcentury modern design, died on July 12 in Piedmont, Calif. She was 75 and lived there and in Miami.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, her family said.         The store, opened in 1959 and still in operation, brought an appreciation for simple, functional design to a city famous for fanciful ornamentation. It sells flatware, glassware, furniture and other household items, many by modernists like Alvar Aalto and Arne Jacobsen, all designed for aesthetic appeal as well as utility. The store also presented exhibitions devoted to designers, materials, manufacturers and design trends.         Ms. Arango was acknowledged to have influenced generations of designers and architects in Miami. In 1981, she expanded her exhibition program by establishing the Arango Design Foundation.         Its shows, which traveled to other cities, included ''Out of the Ordinary,'' a look at well-designed and commonly available objects like paintbrushes, padlocks and a scissors to remove the tops of soft-boiled eggs, and ''Re(f)use,'' devoted to products made from recycled materials.         Ms. Arango was also a contributor to design publications like Abitare and Domus, and she wrote a ''Design of the Month'' column for The San Francisco Chronicle. The column, which reviewed everyday items like mops and coffee makers, appeared through this summer.         Ms. Arango, whose maiden name was Wolpert, was born on July 1, 1928, in Miami, where her father owned a conventional furniture store. After graduating from Wellesley with a degree in philosophy, she worked for the United States Information Service in Bogotá, Colombia.         Ms. Arango's first marriage ended in divorce. She is survived by her husband, John B. Henderson of Piedmont and Miami; her children from her first marriage, Richard Arango of Miami and Virginia Arango of Raleigh, N.C.; a sister, Carol Jane Gottfried of Miami; a brother, Jordan Dancer of Scottsdale, Ariz.; and two grandchildren.       
         Marilyn E. Marlow, a literary agent who represented and championed many outstanding children's book writers and illustrators, especially those who wrote for teenage readers, died on Aug. 25 at the home of her niece Meg McCabe in Katonah, N.Y. She was 75 and lived in Manhattan. The cause was cancer, her family said.         In 1959 Ms. Marlow joined the Curtis Brown literary agency, and she remained there, becoming executive vice president.         She maintained lifetime relationships with many of her clients, for example taking on S. E. Hinton when she was a teenager in Tulsa, Okla. Ms. Hinton's first novel, ''The Outsiders,'' published in 1967, is widely considered one of the first books in the young adult genre; it was later made into a movie by Francis Ford Coppola. Ms. Marlow also represented Robert Cormier, the author of ''The Chocolate War''(1974) and other books for teenagers that were considered controversial because of their dark subject matter.         Her clients included entire families, like the Hurds: Clement, the illustrator of ''Goodnight Moon'' and ''The Runaway Bunny''; Edith, the author of ''Johnny Lion's Rubber Boots,''; and their son, Thacher, the author and illustrator of ''Art Dog.'' Among her other noted authors and illustrators were Jane Yolen, Jane Dyer, Karen Cushman and Patricia McKissack. Among the writers for adults whom she also represented from the beginning of her career were Wilfred Sheed, John Leonard and Michael Novak.         Ms. Marlow was born and raised in Waterloo, Iowa, graduated from the University of Northern Iowa at Cedar Falls and received a master's degree in English from the University of Michigan in 1953. She taught high school English in Iowa and Michigan before coming to New York in 1957. She worked for the publisher Harcourt Brace World before joining Curtis Brown.         Her survivors include a brother, William Marlow, of Arlington, Va., and a sister, Joan Marlow Foley, of Schoolcraft, Mo.       
         Norma Storch, a white woman whose decision to have her 4-year-old mixed-race daughter raised by a black couple became the subject of an Emmy Award-winning documentary made by the daughter in adulthood, died on Aug. 28 at her home in Manhattan. She was 81.         The cause was cancer, said the daughter, June Cross, the producer of the documentary, ''Secret Daughter,'' which PBS broadcast in 1996.         The film was heralded as a searing look at race relations in the 1950's and 60's, and drew praise for its emotional rawness and the bravery of both mother and daughter. Other reviews suggested that the documentary's power came from a mother's willingness to reject her daughter and then rationalize it.         Ms. Cross said in an interview last week that this impression properly reflected the documentary but not their real relationship. She said that tensions were exaggerated for dramatic effect.         But for almost 35 years, Mrs. Storch and her husband -- the actor and comedian Larry Storch, who starred as Cpl. Randolph Agarn in the 1960's comedy series ''F Troop,''-- indisputably lived a lie. They told friends and acquaintances that the black girl who visited them at their Hollywood home was their adopted daughter, who lived with a black family for most of the year.         The truth was that Ms. Cross was the child of an affair Mrs. Storch had had with Jimmy Cross, a black song-and-dance man who was Stump in the well-known performing team Stump and Stumpy.         Mrs. Storch fled Mr. Cross soon after their daughter's birth in 1954, because of his drinking, drug use and violence toward her, she said. As June matured and her complexion darkened, she and her mother encountered racist reactions, including a petition from residents of their Manhattan building demanding that they leave.         Mrs. Storch asked two friends, a middle-class black couple in Atlantic City, to raise June. After they took her in, Mrs. Storch cried every night, developed shingles and wrote daily letters to the girl, according to the documentary.         Norma Greve was born on April 6, 1922, in Pocatello, Idaho. Her mother moved from place to place, married seven times or so, and from time to time vanished completely. From the time Mrs. Storch was 9 until her marriage, she used the last name Booth, the name of one of her stepfathers.         Shortly after graduation from high school in Long Beach, Calif., Norma Greve married Jack May, a competitive surfer, with whom she had a son, Lary. After their divorce in 1945, she moved to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career, and became a member of the Circle Repertory Theater.         In 1947, she had a brief romance with Larry Storch, and gave birth in 1948 to a daughter, Candace, whom they put up for adoption. Ms. Cross said that Candace and the Storches were reunited after Candace read an article about the documentary in People magazine.         Mrs. Storch had placed Lary with various caretakers as she pursued her acting career. He is now a professor at the University of Minnesota and helped persuade his mother to participate in the documentary.         In addition to June Cross and Lary May, Mrs. Storch is survived by her husband, who lives in Manhattan; her daughter Candace Herman of Los Angeles; and six grandchildren.         Mrs. Storch was working as a hatcheck girl in Manhattan in 1959 when she renewed her relationship with Mr. Storch. They were married in 1961, and two years later moved to Hollywood, where she managed his career.         June Cross spent many summers with them. For the couple's conservative friends, they concocted an elaborate story about having adopted June, who they said was the abused child of former neighbors. They said they had sent the girl to live with black friends of theirs, which was true.         ''In those days, people were encrusted in prejudice,'' Mr. Storch said in an interview with People magazine in 1996. ''We saw no reason to rock the boat.''         Neither did Ms. Cross, even after graduating from Harvard and making a successful career as a television producer, with PBS's MacNeil-Lehrer Report, then at CBS News and later with ''Frontline'' on PBS.         She had one reunion with her father, months before he died of cancer in 1981. She told People magazine that she felt only ''detached curiosity.''         But Ms. Cross said she came to appreciate the decision her mother had made when she was a little girl. In one scene in the documentary, she laughs nervously when her mother says she would have aborted her if she had had enough money.         At another point in the film, she says, ''I think the truth of it is that she loved me enough to give me away.''       
         Lady Donaldson, the first woman to be lord mayor of London in the 800-year history of the office, died on Saturday at a hospice near her family home in Lymington, England. She was 82.         For one term in 1983, Lady Donaldson held the highest title of the City of London. In 1981 and 1982, she was also the first woman to be the City's sheriff, a position established 500 years before that of lord mayor.         The ancient City is not London, although it is surrounded by London. Established by a royal charter in the 12th century, it is now famous as England's financial center.         By tradition, when the queen makes a state visit there, the lord mayor, carrying a sword, meets her at the city limit. The monarch gently pushes aside the proffered sword to signify acceptance of the lord mayor's sovereignty.         After being sheriff and lord mayor, Lady Donaldson went on to lead organizations concerned with cancer and the ethics of in-vitro fertilization, to serve on Britain's press complaints commission and to be chairwoman of a committee overseeing the ombudsman appointed to supervise the banking industry.         No women have succeeded Lady Donaldson as lord mayor. Because she was married to a baron, she was called lady rather than her own title of dame, which goes with the lord mayor's job. She also insisted on being called lord mayor, rather than lady mayor, and fined anybody who feminized her title a pound.         ''The fact that I'm a woman is purely biological,'' she said in an interview with The Associated Press in 1983. ''If it encourages other women to take more positions of responsibility, then it'll have achieved something, but I'm not a feminist.''         Dorothy Mary Warwick was born in Wickham, Hampshire, on Aug. 29, 1921. Her father, Reginald George Gale Warwick, was an ironmonger. Her mother, Dorothy Alice Warwick, was a schoolteacher and the first woman to serve on her local governing council.         Miss Warwick left high school to spend a year teaching English in Paris. On her return, she began training in Oxford to become a nurse. In London during World War II, she treated soldiers returning from Dunkirk and victims of the blitz.         Toward the end of the war, she met John Donaldson, a lieutenant colonel in the army, through his mother, whom Miss Warwick cared for in the hospital. They were married in 1945.         Her husband, an eminent lawyer and judge, was appointed master of the rolls, one of the highest-ranking posts in Britain's judiciary.         ''We've always led two separate lives -- perhaps that's why our marriage works so well,'' Lady Donaldson said to The New York Times in 1983. ''We've always got something to talk about.''         In addition to her husband, Lady Donaldson is survived by a son, two daughters and six grandchildren.         Before becoming sheriff, Lady Donaldson was the first woman to be a City alderman. Another woman, Edwina Coven, was elected 17 months earlier, but was vetoed by her fellow aldermen. It was the Court of Aldermen that elected Lady Donaldson lord mayor after she had been nominated by the City's livery companies, a mixture of charitable trusts, gentlemen's clubs and guardians of craft standards and training.         Lady Donaldson shunned the lord mayor's traditional garb, as her obituary in The Daily Telegraph yesterday pointed up.         ''If I were 20 years younger and considerably slimmer I might have considered wearing knee breeches like the men,'' she said. ''I hope to do better than the men who wear a suit under the robes. I'll only need a bra and slip.''       
         Margaret E. Murie, a conservationist and an author who helped preserve millions of acres of unspoiled land in Alaska and across the United States by encouraging the creation of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the passage of the Wilderness Act, died on Sunday at her ranch in Moose, Wyo. She was 101.         A longtime official of the Wilderness Society, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, by President Bill Clinton in 1998.         Ms. Murie, who was known as Mardy, grew up in a log cabin in Alaska, an experience that she wrote about in her autobiography, ''Two in the Far North.''         Published in 1962 and still in print, the book describes the winter night when she was 14 and Fairbanks caught fire, prompting her father and other men to burn the town's bacon supply as fuel to keep the steam-powered water pump running; her late-winter dogsled trips over thawing rivers; how in 1924 she became the first woman to graduate from the University of Alaska; and her marriage later that year, in a 3 a.m. sunrise ceremony, to Olaus Murie, a biologist for the Biological Survey, the forerunner of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.         ''Two in the Far North'' also recounts the couple's honeymoon, a 500-mile caribou research expedition by dogsled, as well as a later river journey taken with their infant son, Martin, strapped to their canoe.         Although Ms. Murie (pronounced MYUR-ee) and her husband moved to Wyoming in the 1930's to study elk migrations, they never lost their focus on Alaska and returned there often.         After traveling in the Brooks Range above the Arctic Circle in the summer of 1956, they began a campaign to set aside parts of the area as a wildlife refuge.         Four years later, President Dwight D. Eisenhower designated eight million acres as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; President Jimmy Carter more than doubled the protected area in 1980.         The Muries extended their preservation campaign in the early 1960's by lobbying Congress in behalf of the Wilderness Act, legislation intended to prevent development on designated lands nationwide. Ms. Murie continued her support after her husband's death in 1963. She was invited to the White House by President Lyndon B. Johnson to attend the signing of the act.         Ms. Murie received numerous other honors for her support of conservation and the protection of the environment, including the 1980 Audubon Medal and the 1983 John Muir Award from the Sierra Club.         Born Margaret Elizabeth Thomas on Aug. 18, 1902, in Seattle, she moved to Alaska with her family when she was 9.         In addition to her autobiography, she wrote two other books, ''Island Between,'' published in 1977, and ''Wapiti Wilderness,'' published in 1966 with her husband as co-author.         Their Wyoming home, the Murie Ranch, was declared a National Historic District in 1997 and today is the headquarters of the Murie Center, an educational center dedicated to conservation.         Ms. Murie is survived by her sister Louise Murie-MacLeod of Jackson, Wyo., who was the wife of Olaus's brother Adolph, who was a National Park Service biologist and an author; two sons, Martin, of North Bangor, N.Y., and Donald, of Palm Springs, Calif.; a daughter, Joanne Miller of Brookline, Mass.; 9 grandchildren; and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Madame Chiang Kai-shek, a pivotal player in one of the 20th century's great epics -- the struggle for control of post-imperial China waged between the Nationalists and the Communists during the Japanese invasion and the violent aftermath of World War II -- died on Thursday in New York City, the Foreign Ministry of Taiwan reported early Friday. She was 105 years old.         Madame Chiang, a dazzling and imperious politician, wielded immense influence in Nationalist China, but she and her husband were eventually forced by the Communist victory into exile in Taiwan, where she presided as the grand dame of Nationalist politics for many years. After Chiang Kai-shek died in 1975, Madame Chiang retreated to New York City, where she lived out her last quarter-century.         Madame Chiang was the most famous member of one of modern China's most remarkable families, the Soongs, who dominated Chinese politics and finance in the first half of the century. Yet in China it was her American background and lifestyle that distinguished Soong Mei-ling, her maiden name.         For many Americans, Madame Chiang's finest moment came in 1943, when she barnstormed the United States in search of support for the Nationalist cause against Japan, winning donations from countless Americans who were mesmerized by her passion, determination and striking good looks. Her address to a joint meeting of Congress electrified Washington, winning billions of dollars in aid.         Madame Chiang helped craft American policy toward China during the war years, running the Nationalist Government's propaganda operation and emerging as its most important diplomat. Yet she was also deeply involved in the endless maneuvering of her husband, who served uneasily at the helm of several shifting alliances with Chinese warords vying for control of what was then a badly fractured nation.         A devout Christian, Madame Chiang spoke fluent English tintged with the Southern accent she acquired as a school girl in Georgia, and presented a civilized and humane image of a courageous China battling a Japanese invasion and Communist subversion. Yet historians have documented the murderous path that Chiang Kai-shek led in his efforts to win, then keep, and ultimately lose power. It also became clear in later years that the Chiang family had pocketed hundreds of millions of dollars of American aid intended for the war.         Madame Chiang had a notoriously tempestuous relationship with her husband, and then with his son by a previous marriage, Chiang Ching-kuo, who became Taiwan's leader after Chiang Kai-shek's death. Madame Chiang had no children.         Her skill as a politician, alternately charming and vicious, made her a formidable presence. She made a play for Taiwan's leadership after Chiang Ching-kuo died in 1988, even though she was 90 and living in New York at the time.         Although she suffered numerous ailments, including breast cancer, Madame Chiang eventually outlived all her contemporary rivals. She was said to credit her religious faith for her good health.         Soong Mei-ling's rise to power began when she married Chiang Kai-shek in an opulent ceremony in Shanghai in 1927, bringing together China's star military man with one of the nation's most illustrious families.         Although Madame Chiang developed a stellar image with the American public, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and other leaders became disillusioned with her and her husband's despotic and corrupt practices. Eleanor Roosevelt was shocked at Madame Chiang's answer when asked at a dinner at the White House how the Chinese government would handle a strike by coal miners. Madame Chiang silently drew a sharp fingernail across her neck.         ''She can talk beautifully about democracy,'' Mrs. Roosevelt said later. ''But she does not know how to live democracy.''         By the end of the war, the loyalty of Nationalist officials melted away as the government grew corrupt and fiscally traitorous,         During the 1950's, Madame Chiang and her husband blamed the United States for the Nationalist loss of China, and continued to campaign for help from Washington to retake the mainland. Although that hope eventually faded, American support for Taiwan remained strong for years, delaying Washington's recognition of Beijing as the capital of China until 1979, three decades after the Communists had seized power.         By then, Madame Chiang had moved to New York, where she lived in an apartment on Gracie Square in Manhattan. In March 1999, as she turned 101, hard of hearing but still quick-witted, she told visitors that she read the Bible and The New York Times every day.         The Chiang-Soong wedding took place in Shanghai on Dec. 1, 1927. A small Christian ceremony was held at the Soong mansion on Seymour Road, followed by a political ceremony at the Majestic Hotel, beneath a portrait of Sun Yat-sen.         Madame Chiang became a true political partner to her husband, traveling with him, advising him on military and political matters, turning her charm on allies and foes alike. Chiang spoke almost no English, though his wife taught him to call her ''darling,'' and she served as his interpreter, often interspersing her own views.         During World War II, Madame Chiang emerged as China's most important ambassador, frequently charming American visitors like Wendell Wilkie, the Republican politician, who came to China in 1942 after losing a presidential campaign against Roosevelt in 1940.         Madame Chiang made a splash in Washington after the war. She spoke forcefully and passionately to Congress, winning a roaring ovation. She then traveled across the country, appearing at Madison Square Garden and at the Hollywood Bowl.         The Nationalists received considerable American aid, but as John Service, a longtime Foreign Service officer in China, warned in a memorandum about General Chiang: ''He has achieved and maintained his position in China by his supreme skill in balancing man against man and group against group, and his adroitness as a military politician rather than as a military commander, and by reliance on a gangster secret police.''         General Chiang resigned as president of Nationalist China in January 1949 and fled to Taiwan that May, taking with him a national art collection that was kept in crates in Taiwan for years as the Chiangs clung to the ever-diminishing hope that they would some day take it back to Beijing.         In the United States, the Chiangs set up what would become one of the most sophisticated lobbying efforts ever in Washington, learning how to distribute millions of dollars indirectly through law firms and public relations companies. The operation continues today.         Madame Chiang made several trips to the United States in the 1950's to oppose efforts by the People's Republic of China to win a seat at the United Nations. Only in 1971 did the United Nations allow the government of the world's most populous country to be represented, a prelude to President Nixon's trip to Beijing in 1972.         Madame Chiang lived out her final years in New York, with a pack of black-suited bodyguards who cleared the lobby of her Gracie Square apartment building every time she entered or left. She returned to Congress for one last appearance in 1995.         Correction:  November 17, 2003, Monday  An obituary of Mme. Chiang Kai-shek on Oct. 25 and in some late editions on Oct. 24 referred imprecisely to her attempt to influence political control in Taiwan in 1988, after the death of her stepson, Chiang Ching-kuo, who had been president as well as chairman of the ruling Nationalist Party. Mme. Chiang tried unsuccessfully to block his successor as president, Lee Teng-hui, from succeeding him as chairman; she did not seek office for herself, nor was she eligible to do so.       
         Madame Chiang Kai-shek, a pivotal figure in one of the 20th century's great epics -- the struggle for control of post-imperial China waged between the Nationalists and the Communists during the Japanese invasion and the violent aftermath of World War II -- died on Thursday in Manhattan, the Foreign Ministry of Taiwan reported yesterday. She was 105.         Madame Chiang, a dazzling and imperious politician, wielded immense influence in Nationalist China, but she and her husband were eventually forced by the Communist victory into exile in Taiwan, where she presided as the grande dame of Nationalist politics for many years. After Chiang Kai-shek died in 1975, she retreated to New York City, where she spent the rest of her life.         But her old influence overseas was matched, and perhaps exceeded, by the relentless and sophisticated lobbying effort she and her husband set up in Washington, through which they distributed uncounted millions through law firms and public relations companies to promote Taiwan's cause and maintain recognition by the American government.         During the 1950's, Madame Chiang and her husband blamed the United States for the Nationalists' loss of China, and continued to campaign for help from Washington to retake the mainland. Although that hope eventually faded, American support for Taiwan remained strong for years, delaying Washington's recognition of Beijing as the capital of China until 1979, three decades after the Communists seized power.         As a fluent English speaker, as a Christian, as a model of what many Americans hoped China to become, Madame Chiang struck a chord with American audiences as she traveled across the country, starting in the 1930's, raising money and lobbying for support of her husband's government. She seemed to many Americans to be the very symbol of the modern, educated, pro-American China they yearned to see emerge -- even as many Chinese dismissed her as a corrupt, power-hungry symbol of the past they wanted to escape.         Ultimately, that difference in perspectives was perhaps one reason that she fled an increasingly democratic Taiwan, where many people reviled her and where she felt less at home as native Taiwanese eclipsed the exiled mainlanders.         Madame Chiang was the most famous member of one of modern China's most remarkable families, the Soongs, who dominated Chinese politics and finance in the first half of the 20th century. Yet in China it was her American background and style that distinguished Soong Mei-ling; that was her maiden name, sometimes spelled May-ling.         For many Americans, her finest moment came in 1943, when she barnstormed the United States in search of support for the Nationalist cause against Japan, winning donations from countless Americans who were mesmerized by her passion, determination and striking good looks. Her address to a joint meeting of Congress electrified Washington, winning billions of dollars in aid.         She helped create American policy toward China during the war years, running the Nationalist government's propaganda operation and emerging as its most important diplomat. Yet she was also deeply involved in the endless maneuverings of her husband, who was uneasily at the helm of several shifting alliances with Chinese warlords vying for control of what was then a badly fractured nation.         A devout Christian, Madame Chiang spoke fluent English tinted with the Southern accent she acquired as a schoolgirl in Georgia, and she presented a civilized and humane image of a courageous China battling Japanese invasion and Communist subversion. Yet historians have documented the murderous path that Chiang Kai-shek led in his efforts to win, then keep, and ultimately lose power. It also became clear in later years that the Chiang family had pocketed hundreds of millions of dollars of American aid intended for the war.         Madame Chiang had a notoriously tempestuous relationship with her husband, and then with his son by a previous marriage, Chiang Ching-kuo, who became Taiwan's leader after Chiang Kai-shek's death. She had no children.         Her skill as a politician, alternately charming and vicious, made her a formidable presence. She made a play for Taiwan's leadership after Chiang Ching-kuo died in 1988, even though she was 90 and living in New York.         Although she suffered numerous ailments, including breast cancer, she outlived all her contemporary rivals. She was said to credit her religious faith -- she told friends she rose at dawn for an hour of prayer each day -- for her good health.         Gen. Joseph W. Stilwell, who worked closely with her when he commanded American forces in China during the war, described Madame Chiang in his diary as a ''clever, brainy woman.''         ''Direct, forceful, energetic,'' he wrote. ''Loves power, eats up publicity and flattery, pretty weak on her history. Can turn on charm at will and knows it.''         Soong Mei-ling's rise to power began when she married Chiang in an opulent ceremony in Shanghai in 1927, bringing together China's star military man with one of the nation's most illustrious families.         Her eldest sister, Soong Ai-ling, directed the family's affairs and innumerable money-making ventures with the help of her husband, H. H. Kung, a scion of one of China's wealthiest banking families.         Madame Chiang's second sister, Soong Qing-ling, was the wife of Sun Yat-sen, China's first president after the last emperor was toppled in 1911. After Sun's death, Soong Qing-ling carried his banner over into the Communist camp, causing an irreparable rupture in the family.         When the vanquished Nationalists retreated to Taiwan in 1949, Soong Qing-ling stayed behind. The Communist Party leadership called her the only true patriot in the Soong family, and appointed her honorary chairman of the People's Republic in 1980, a year before her death.         A Telling Ditty         Today, Chinese still remember the three sisters with a telling ditty: ''One loved money, one loved power, one loved China,'' referring respectively to Ai-ling, Mei-ling and Qing-ling.         Madame Chiang's elder brother, T. V. Soong, often called Nationalist China's financial wizard, served at various times as finance minister, acting prime minister and foreign minister, where his primary role was raising money from America.         Although Madame Chiang developed a stellar image with the American public, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and other leaders became disillusioned with her and her husband's despotic and corrupt practices. Eleanor Roosevelt was shocked at her answer when asked at a dinner at the White House how the Chinese government would handle a strike by coal miners. Madame Chiang silently drew a sharp fingernail across her neck.         ''She can talk beautifully about democracy,'' Mrs. Roosevelt said later. ''But she does not know how to live democracy.''         By the end of the war, the loyalty of Nationalist officials melted away as the government grew corrupt and fiscally traitorous, printing money so aggressively that the Chinese currency fell to an exchange rate of several million yuan to the dollar. Many Nationalist soldiers were reduced to begging for food because they went unpaid, yet American diplomats discovered that military supplies sent from the United States to China sometimes appeared on the black market soon after arrival.         During the 1950's, Madame Chiang and her husband continued to campaign for help from Washington to retake the mainland, although That hope eventually faded.         In New York, Madame Chiang lived in an apartment on Gracie Square in Manhattan. In March 1999, as she turned 101, hard of hearing but still quick-witted, she told visitors that she read the Bible and The New York Times every day.         The Soong family's saga, cutting across many strands of modern Chinese history, began when Madame Chiang's father, Charlie Soong, sailed to the United States at the age of 12. Coming from a family of traders in Hainan Island in the South China Sea, Mr. Soong was taken in by Methodists in North Carolina who converted him to Christianity in hopes of sending him back to spread the word of Jesus in China.         After returning to Shanghai in 1886, Mr. Soong, a genial wheeler-dealer, passed up missionary life to start a business printing Bibles, earning a fortune. He also printed political pamphlets secretly for Sun Yat-sen, then working to overthrow China's last emperor. On Jan. 1, 1912, Sun became China's first president.         Sun lasted in office only a few months before his coalition disintegrated, and after he fled to Japan, he hired Mr. Soong's second daughter, Soong Qing-ling, as a secretary. They soon married, despite the age difference: he was 50 and she was 21.         Educated in America         Mei-ling Soong was born in Shanghai on March 5, 1898, although some references give 1897 as the year because Chinese usually consider everyone to be one year old at birth. At the age of 10, she had followed her elder sisters to the Wesleyan College for Women in Macon, Ga.         She entered Wellesley College near Boston in 1913; her brother, T. V., was enrolled at Harvard. She majored in English literature, and was remembered by her classmates as a chubby, vivacious and determined student. She graduated in 1917 and returned to Shanghai speaking English better than Chinese.         She was introduced to her future husband in 1922. By that time, she had matured into a slender beauty and taken to wearing full-length, body-hugging gowns.         Chiang Kai-shek, a severe-looking military aide to Sun who established a school for officers in southern China, may have been as attracted to the Soongs' financial and political connections as he was to their youngest daughter. His initial overtures to her were rebuffed, and after Sun's death in 1925, as Chiang took the title generalissimo and tried to succeed him as the leader of the Nationalist cause, he proposed to Sun's young widow, Soong Qing-ling. She said no.         Chiang allied himself with warlords in southern and central China and with the Soviet Union, where Stalin regarded the Nationalists as more progressive than the warlords who still controlled Beijing and northern China. Communist rebels, not yet led by Mao Zedong, felt they deserved Moscow's support. But Stalin insisted on supporting the Nationalists.         In 1927, Chiang shocked his Soviet backers by carrying out a massacre of leftists in Shanghai. Edgar Snow, the American journalist, estimated that Chiang's forces had executed more than 5,000 people.         The massacre caused a permanent rent in the Soong family. Soong Qing-ling, as Sun's widow, led a faction of Nationalists who voted to expel Chiang from all his posts. T. V. Soong resigned as finance minister, though he was later persuaded to resume his alliance with Chiang.         When Chiang renewed his interest in Soong Mei-ling in 1927, she told him that she would consent to marry only if he could win the approval of her mother, who had reservations about a man who was neither Christian nor single. Chiang had already fathered a son in a marriage that was arranged when he was only 14, and had adopted a second son and married a second wife, Chen Chieh-ru. Chiang promised to convert, and eventually sent Chen away to the United States, where she enrolled at Columbia University and earned a doctorate.         The Chiang-Soong wedding took place in Shanghai on Dec. 1, 1927. A small Christian ceremony was held at the Soong mansion on Seymour Road, followed by a political ceremony at the Majestic Hotel, beneath a portrait of Sun.         As a political partner to her husband, Madame Chiang developed what she called the New Life Movement, a series of principles for modernizing China through social discipline, courtesy and service. She engineered public hygiene campaigns and denounced traditional superstitions.         While many ordinary Chinese resisted it, the campaign was popular with foreigners, particularly with Henry Luce, the publisher of Time magazine, who was born to missionaries in China. A longtime supporter of the Chiangs, Luce named the couple ''Man and Woman of the Year'' in 1938.         During the war with the Japanese, Madame Chiang pushed her husband to build up the Nationalist air force, and helped hire Claire Chennault, who commanded a mercenary force of pilots that came to be known as the Flying Tigers.         During World War II, the relationship between General Stilwell, Chiang and Madame Chiang proved contentious. The general accused Chiang of hoarding resources, deliberately avoiding battle with the Japanese to spare his men to fight the Communists.         Madame Chiang was in the middle, sometimes interceding on General Stilwell's behalf when resisting him threatened American support. But she also plotted against the general, telling journalists that he was incompetent. She and her husband lobbied Washington to have him replaced, and he was, in 1944.         After Japan was defeated in 1945 and the civil war between Nationalists and Communists accelerated, the Communists swiftly expanded their control into the northeast.         The governing Nationalists received considerable American aid, but American officials in China warned of vast amounts of graft among Nationalists. More than $3 billion was appropriated to China during the war, and most of it was transmitted through T. V. Soong, who as China's foreign minister was based in Washington. It later became apparent that the Soong family suffered vicious infighting over the purloined funds.         Madame Chiang traveled to Washington again in November 1948 to plead for emergency aid for the war against the Communists. Yet Congress had recently assigned $1 billion more to China, and President Truman was impatient with the Chiangs and what had become an apparently hopeless effort to shore up the Nationalist government. Madame Chiang never returned to China.         ''I can ask the American people for nothing more,'' she said. ''It is either in your hearts to love us, or your hearts have been turned from us.''         In her frustration, she publicly likened American politics to ''clodhopping boorishness.'' Coming after years of generous American support, that irritated Truman.         ''They're thieves, every damn one of them,'' Truman said later, referring to Nationalist leaders. ''They stole $750 million out of the billions that we sent to Chiang. They stole it, and it's invested in real estate down in São Paolo and some right here in New York.''         General Chiang resigned as president of Nationalist China in January 1949 and fled to Taiwan that May, taking with him a national art collection that was kept in crates in Taiwan for years as the Chiangs clung to the ever-diminishing hope that they would some day take it back to Beijing.         Over the years, Madame Chiang's health wavered, and in 1976 she was diagnosed with breast cancer and had a mastectomy, and later, a second one.         Her Final Years         Even after she moved to permanent residence in New York, she kept her finger on the pulse of Nationalist politics. She returned to Taiwan after her stepson died in January 1988. Even though she was nearly 90, she tried to rally her old allies. But Lee Teng-hui, chosen as vice president both because he was Taiwan-born and because he was considered a pushover by fellow Nationalists, proved more adept at politics than expected, and he gradually solidified his control.         Madame Chiang lived out her final years in New York, with a pack of black-suited bodyguards who cleared the lobby of her Gracie Square apartment building every time she entered or left. She returned to Congress for one last appearance in 1995.         Until this year, Madame Chiang maintained an annual tradition of receiving a few friends at her Manhattan apartment on her birthday. But this year, she came down with pneumonia, and was was unable to do that, the local Chinese press reported.         Her last public appearance was believed to be in January 2000, when she attended an exhibition of her watercolor paintings of traditional Chinese landscapes at the Queens headquarters of the World Journal, a prominent local Chinese newspaper. She was in a wheelchair, but was reported to be in good spirits, telling people there that she was very happy that day.         Correction:  November 17, 2003, Monday  An obituary of Mme. Chiang Kai-shek on Oct. 25 and in some late editions on Oct. 24 referred imprecisely to her attempt to influence political control in Taiwan in 1988, after the death of her stepson, Chiang Ching-kuo, who had been president as well as chairman of the ruling Nationalist Party. Mme. Chiang tried unsuccessfully to block his successor as president, Lee Teng-hui, from succeeding him as chairman; she did not seek office for herself, nor was she eligible to do so.       
         Rosalie Allen, who came out of Pennsylvania coal country to become a popular singing cowgirl and yodeler in New York, where she was also the city's only country D.J. for a while, died on Sept. 23 in Palmdale, Calif. She was 79.         The cause was heart failure that followed diabetes and other ailments, said a friend, Alois Krtil. At the time of her death she used the name Julia Gilbert, with the surname being that of her last husband, Mr. Krtil said.         Miss Allen became known as Queen of the Yodelers after winning a national yodeling contest in 1939. As a singer her style was likened to Patsy Montana, and one of her most successful recordings was a version for RCA Victor of Montana's hit ''I Want to Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart.''         She was also known for her yodeling duets with Elton Britt. Two of their hits were ''Beyond the Sunset (Should You Go First)'' and ''Quicksilver.''         In September 1947, Miss Allen was part of the first country concert at Carnegie Hall, along with Ernest Tubb, Minnie Pearl and others. In the mid-1940's she became a partner in Rosalie Allen's Hillbilly Music Center on West 54th Street, one of the first record stores in the United States to sell only country music.         Miss Allen was perhaps best known to New Yorkers for playing host on the radio program ''Prairie Stars'' on WOV from 1944 to 1956. She parlayed her broadcast appeal into nightly live shows at the Village Barn, a national radio show, a local television show and an Armed Forces Radio Network show.         In an article about her radio career, The New York Times in 1946 called Miss Allen ''a rare four-leafed clover in a field that was one of man's last strongholds.''         Julia Marlene Bedra was born on June 27, 1924, in Old Forge, Pa. She was one of 12 children and her father was a chiropractor, according to The Comprehensive Country Music Encyclopedia.         By the time she was 9 she was working as a dishwasher to help pay family expenses. Listening to the radio inspired her to learn to sing, yodel and play her brother's guitar. She made her radio debut in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and then headed for York, Pa., where she was the featured vocalist with Shorty Fincher's Prairie Pals.         In 1943 she came to New York to sing on Denver Darling's ''Swing Billies'' radio show. According to an article in The Daily News earlier this year, she stalled for three months because she was frightened of the big city. But the chance to raise her pay from $15 a week to $98 ended her hesitation.         She moved in with a sister in Brooklyn and soon she was making $300 a week. In 1944 she became a regular on Zeb Carver's ''Hill Country Jamboree'' show, where her sunny personality prompted WOV to recruit her for a half-hour nightly show of her own.         By 1946 she was on the air up to two hours a night, singing and presenting guests like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, Eddy Arnold and Hank Williams. In the late 1940's she became host of a local country show on NBC-TV.         As rock 'n' roll pushed country aside, she moved to Alabama and performed less, even though Montana urged her to return to the recording studio, according to Mr. Krtil. He said she was stopped by a combination of health and marital problems, as well as by disputes with Nashville producers.         Miss Allen had strong opinions about country music and wrote articles and columns for publications like National Jamboree, Country Sound Roundup and Hoedown. For example, in the Times interview, she expressed regret that so much ''New York corn'' was being substituted for fine Southern mountain music in the local scene.         She also differentiated between hillbilly and cowboy music, calling hillbilly a twangy novelty. She said, ''I think that people who don't like cowboy music are often those who can't face reality.''         Among the fan mail she received were not a few marriage proposals. Her answer to these epistles was usually enough to dissuade potential suitors: Mrs. Malcolm McGlasson.         She was unmarried at her death, and is survived by her daughter, Dorothy Bunch of Palmdale.       
         Carolyn G. Heilbrun, a retired Columbia University literary scholar whose extensive writings included pioneering books and essays in the feminist canon and a dozen highly erudite detective novels under the pseudonym Amanda Cross, died at her home in Manhattan on Thursday. She was 77.         Professor Heilbrun, who had written of taking her own life in a 1997 book, ''The Last Gift of Time: Life Beyond Sixty,'' committed suicide, said her son, Robert. She had not been ill, he noted yesterday. ''She wanted to control her destiny,'' he said, ''and she felt her life was a journey that had concluded.''         Aside from serving as an instructor at Brooklyn College in 1959-60 and as a visiting lecturer or professor at Yale, Princeton, Swarthmore and other colleges, Ms. Heilbrun spent her entire academic career at Columbia, joining the faculty in 1960 as an instructor of English and comparative literature and retiring in 1992 as the Avalon Foundation Professor in the Humanities.         But she was best known as the author of nine scholarly books, including ''Toward a Recognition of Androgyny,'' ''Reinventing Womanhood'' and ''Writing a Woman's Life,'' and scores of articles that interpreted women's literature from a feminist perspective, and as the author of the Kate Fansler mysteries. Her heroine, like her creator, was a professor of literature and a feminist.         The novels were ostensibly murder mysteries whose amateur sleuth sometimes sought clues in literary texts and a killer's motives in academic politics. Most were well received by readers, but some critics said the plots were thin and the social commentary thick, and that the real subjects were women's changing social positions, relationships with one another and struggle for independence.         The books offered scathing depictions of academic backbiting, observations on Ivy League social pretensions and thinly veiled, unflattering portraits of Columbia colleagues, including one professor who seemed to have been modeled after the writer Lionel Trilling.         Some critics complained that satiric wit and clever talk filled half a book before the victim fell dead, and that some of it sounded like an imitation of Oscar Wilde or George Bernard Shaw. But devotees said it was all good fun, and some compared her work to the cerebral puzzles of Dorothy L. Sayers.         Fearing that her mystery writing might be seen by colleagues as frivolous and might even jeopardize her chances for tenure, Ms. Heilbrun concealed the identity of Amanda Cross for six years. In 1964 her first novel, ''In the Last Analysis,'' was nominated for an Edgar Award by the Mystery Writers of America. ''Winning would have blown my cover,'' she recalled.         But after the 1970 publication of ''Poetic Justice,'' with its recognizable depiction of Columbia University's atmosphere after the student revolt of the late 1960's, Ms. Heilbrun's friends began to guess that she might be Amanda Cross, the author of three novels, including ''The James Joyce Murder.'' Later novels included ''Death in a Tenured Position,'' ''No Word from Winifred'' and ''The Puzzled Heart.''         Carolyn Gold Heilbrun was born on Jan. 13, 1926, in East Orange, N.J., the only child of Archibald Gold, an accountant, and Estelle Roemer Gold, who, her daughter would recall, ''sat at home and was bored out of her mind.'' The family moved to Manhattan when Ms. Heilbrun was 6, and she became a voracious reader, devouring Nancy Drew and Judy Bolton mysteries and, as a teenager, the novels of Virginia Woolf and Willa Cather.         She graduated from private schools in New York and from Wellesley College in 1947 with a bachelor's degree in English. She was married in 1945 to James Heilbrun, a Harvard student who became a professor of economics at Fordham University. In addition to her son, of Brooklyn, and her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Margaret Heilbrun, of Brooklyn, and Emily Heilbrun, of Eugene, Ore., and two grandchildren.         Enrolling in graduate school at Columbia, Ms. Heilbrun received a master's degree in 1951 and a doctorate in 1959. Her first notable essay was ''The Character of Hamlet's Mother,'' a 1957 article in Shakespeare Quarterly. It portrayed Gertrude as clever, not shallow, lucid rather than silly: ideas that were forerunners of feminism at the time, but hardly startling when the essay was reprinted in 1990 as part of ''Hamlet's Mother and Other Women.''         On the Columbia faculty, Ms. Heilbrun rose through the ranks: assistant professor in 1962, associate professor in 1967, full professor with tenure in 1972, Avalon Professor in 1985. In 1986 she became the first director of the university's Institute for Research on Women and Gender, which promotes feminist scholarship.         Her academic specialty was British modern literature, roughly from 1890 to 1950, an era that included Yeats, Conrad and Eliot, with a particular focus on the Bloomsbury group, made up of Virginia Woolf, Lytton Strachey, E. M. Forster and other writers.         Although she was widely respected by feminist scholars, she complained when she retired that she was isolated by her male colleagues at Columbia. ''When I spoke up for women's issues, I was made to feel unwelcome in my own department, kept off crucial committees, ridiculed, ignored,'' she told Anne Matthews in an interview for a New York Times Magazine article in 1992.         Throughout her academic career, and afterward, Ms. Heilbrun continued to write books and contribute articles to professional journals, newspapers and magazines. She wrote numerous book reviews and essays for Hers, a former column in The Times.         Her 1973 book, ''Toward a Recognition of Androgyny: Aspects of Male and Female in Literature,'' brought her to prominence in the academic feminist movement. Rejecting traditional ideas of male and female and using examples from Greek literature, the Bible and other writings, she urged women to escape from what she called the prison of gender.         Ms. Heilbrun drew on her long interest in biography and autobiography for her 1988 book, ''Writing a Woman's Life,'' her first best seller, which focused on women writing about themselves and other women. Even accomplished women, like Virginia Woolf and Eudora Welty, tended to judge themselves on how well they fulfilled traditional expectations, she concluded.       
         Christabel Burton Bielenberg, a well-born Englishwoman who wrote a best-selling memoir about saving her German husband, a Nazi resister, from the Gestapo, died on Sunday at the family's home in rural Ireland. She was 94.         Her book, ''The Past Is Myself,'' published in 1968, was a runaway success and a Book of the Month Club selection as ''Ride Out the Dark'' (Norton, 1971). It formed the basis for a four-part television drama, called ''Christabel,'' written by Dennis Potter and starring Elizabeth Hurley, which was shown in this country on ''Masterpiece Theater'' on public television in 1989.         Beautiful, headstrong and born to privilege in London, Mrs. Bielenberg spurned a scholarship at Oxford to study opera in Hamburg, Germany, where she fell in love with a dashing law student, Peter Bielenberg. They married in 1934, as Hitler came to power in Berlin. Ignoring advice to move to neutral Ireland, they stayed as he pursued his career as a lawyer and civil servant and their family grew.         Their social circle comprised people who initially rejected Hitler's Nazis as boors and were too late to grasp the true dimensions of the horror that befell Europe. For the Bielenbergs, the moment of truth came when a close friend, Adam von Trott, took part in plotting the attempted assassination of Hitler on July 20, 1944, for which he was hanged.         By January, Peter Bielenberg, suspected of complicity, was being held in a brig for recalcitrant S.S. men at Ravensbrück concentration camp. His wife pulled all the stops, using her well-connected British upbringing to plead for her husband at Gestapo headquarters in Berlin.         As a result, he was spared from being shipped to the eastern front. He was sent to a punishment battalion but escaped to a refuge in the Black Forest, where the Bielenbergs awaited the end of hostilities. After the war, Peter Bielenberg was the first German to receive a postwar visa to Britain.         Christabel Bielenberg reclaimed her British citizenship and, using her connections, returned to Germany briefly as a correspondent for The Observer. But the couple settled in Ireland in 1948, and she eventually became an Irish citizen.         The Bielenbergs bought a decrepit farm, which they nursed to profitability. They lived quietly without dwelling on their wartime experiences until asked to help with a book about Mr. Trott. That prompted Mrs. Bielenberg to start one of her own. It remains in print as ''When I Was a German, 1934-1945: An Englishwoman in Nazi Germany'' (University of Nebraska Press, 2000).         Peter Bielenberg died in 2001. Christabel Bielenberg is survived by their three sons, Nicholas, John and Christopher.         Hailing from a politically involved family, she acknowledged that it was odd for her even in Hitler's Germany not to have spoken out early on.         ''But it's true that we didn't protest soon enough about Hitler,'' she told an interviewer during the filming of ''Christabel.'' ''We just didn't know what had hit us. You read about horrors in the newspapers, but you don't really wake up to them until they touch you personally.''       
         Katharine Thomas O'Neil Bidwell, a patron of music and education who headed the Metropolitan Opera Guild in the 1980's, died last Thursday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 66 and also had a home on Fishers Island, N.Y.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Bidwell was born in Dayton, Ohio, and started a musical career when she joined the St. Louis Municipal Opera at 18. She graduated in 1959 from Sarah Lawrence College, where she became a trustee and sponsored programs in the performing arts.         She joined the board of the Metropolitan Opera Guild in 1966, became first vice president in the late 1970's and was president and chief executive from 1979 to 1986. After that, until 1996, she was the Lincoln Center's director of special projects.         For many years Mrs. Bidwell also headed the advisory council at the New York City Opera. She founded the Katherine Bidwell Foundation for Young Singers and the patrons' program of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, which she helped in commissioning new works.         She was also a trustee of the Greenwall Foundation, which supports emerging artists, Westminster Choir College and the London School of Music and Dramatic Arts.         el1 Mrs. Bidwell's first marriage, to Stephen E. O'Neil, ended in divorce. She is survived by her husband, J. Truman Bidwell Jr.; a daughter, Molly O'Neil Frank, of Manhattan; two sons, Stephen T. O'Neil, of Lookout Mountain, Tenn., and Charles Thomas O'Neil, of Stockbridge, Mass.; a brother, Charles Thomas, of San Diego; a sister, Frances Martin, of St. Louis; and eight grandchildren.       
         Patricia Broderick, a writer and painter who was the mother of the actor Matthew Broderick, died on Tuesday at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 78.         The cause was cancer, her son said.         Raised in Manhattan on the Upper East Side but a devotee of the bohemian Village, Ms. Broderick had a wide range of interests and callings. An artist in her teens, she began writing plays in the 1940's; several were performed in New York and London, sometimes featuring her husband, the actor James Broderick, who died in 1982.         In 1996, her film, ''Infinity,'' a love story based on the life of the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman, was released to generally good reviews and was shown at the Toronto Film Festival. The film was a family affair; Matthew Broderick both directed and starred. Ms. Broderick also worked on the script of ''Glory,'' the 1989 Civil War drama, which starred her son as a young commander in charge of an all-black regiment.         Ms. Broderick continued painting and had her work shown in several galleries in New York and across the country, both in solo shows and with the work of her partner of the last six years, the painter John Wesley.         In addition to Mr. Wesley and her son, Ms. Broderick is survived by two daughters, the Rev. Janet Broderick Kraft and Martha Broderick; a brother, Richard Biow; and five grandchildren.       
         Audrey B. Love, a philanthropist and patron of the arts, died on Saturday at her home in Key Biscayne, Fla. She was 100.         Mrs. Love, who also had an apartment on Park Avenue in Manhattan, was the daughter of Edyth Guggenheim and Adm. Louis Josephthal, and was raised in Manhattan in a family devoted to the arts and philanthropy.         She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Smith College and soon afterward, on a trip to India in 1926, met her future husband, C. Ruxton Love Jr. Mr. Love, who died in 1971, was a Wall Street financier and diplomat, and the couple pursued a shared interest in collecting art.         In World War II, Mrs. Love served as president of the American Women's Voluntary Service. She was also a director of the New York Infirmary Hospital and a member of the Committee for Deaf and Dumb Children at Lenox Hill Hospital.         The Loves' collection of Napoleonic art was exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1978.         She was a founding member of the Lowe Art Museum of the University of Miami. Pieces from her collection of Georgian silver were exhibited at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in 2002.         Mrs. Love, who briefly pursued a career in the theater in her youth, was a lifelong patron of the opera. She contributed to the construction of the Metropolitan Opera in Manhattan. On an evening only days before her death, she was in her front row seat for a production of ''La Traviata'' by the Florida Grand Opera, which she had helped finance.         Mr. Love is survived by two daughters, the archaeologist Iris Love of New York City and Noel Gross of Saddle River, N.J., Wellington, Fla., and Bridgehampton, Long Island, and one grandson.       
         Marjorie Schlesinger Deane, who advised retail stores on fashion trends through an influential publication called the Tobe Report, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 80.         The cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease, her family said.         Until her death, Mrs. Deane was chairwoman of the Tobe Report, a weekly newsletter sold to retailers, where she had worked since the early 1960's. She stopped going to the office about five years ago, her son said.         ''I can remember tearing out pages and sending it to my people and saying we ought to look at this or that,'' said Marvin Traub, former chairman of Bloomingdale's.         She had previously worked as a fashion director at Look magazine and as an accessories stylist and senior vice president at Macy's.         Mrs. Deane was born Marjorie Schlesinger on April 18, 1923, in Manhattan. She graduated in 1943 from the Tobe-Coburn School for Fashion Careers.         In 1952 she married Disque D. Deane; they divorced in 1991.         Mrs. Deane was a former president of the Fashion Group International and a founder of the Council of Fashion Designers of America. She served on the board of the Fashion Institute of Technology and the Educational Foundation for Fashion Industries.         She was involved in numerous philanthropies, including the Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club, where she helped found the Kips Bay Decorator Show House benefit.         She is survived by her sister, Kathryn Michel, of Washington; two daughters, Gregg Deane Swain and Kathryn Deane-Krantz, both of New York; two sons, Disque D. Deane Jr., of Buenos Aires, and Walter Longstreet Deane, of New York; and six grandchildren.       
         C. Z. Guest, one of the monarchs of New York society who was a perennial selection on the best-dressed list, a noted horsewoman and an authority on gardening, died yesterday at home in Old Westbury, N.Y. She was 83.         Mrs. Guest's interest in horticulture began when she was a child following the family gardener around her parents' estate on the North Shore of Boston. Her name then was Lucy Douglas Cochrane, but she soon became C. Z. when her brother, Alexander, could not pronounce ''sister.'' Embarking on a writing career relatively late in life, she was the author of books on gardening and a children's book, ''Tiny Green Thumbs.'' She also wrote a syndicated weekly column that appeared in 350 newspapers across the nation.         Mrs. Guest began her writing career while recovering from a horseback riding accident in 1976. While she was convalescing, frequent telephone calls from friends about their gardening problems prompted her first book, ''First Garden,'' which was illustrated by her ''very dear friend'' Cecil Beaton and which had an introduction by another ''dear, dear friend,'' Truman Capote.         In his introduction, Capote described Mrs. Guest working in her garden: ''There, with her baskets and spades and clippers, and wearing her funny boyish shoes, and with her sunborne sweat soaking her eyes, she is a part of the sky and the earth, possibly a not too significant part, but a part.''         Beaton and Capote were only two in a legion of celebrities and jet-setters who surrounded Mrs. Guest throughout her vivid life. When she was married in 1947 to Winston Frederick Churchill Guest, an international polo star, heir to the Phipps steel fortune and a second cousin of Winston Churchill, the ceremony was held at the home of Ernest Hemingway in Cuba, with Hemingway serving as best man.         Until Mr. Guest's death in 1982, the couple was prominent in international social circles, hunting in India with the Maharaja of Jaipur and frequently entertaining the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, who subsequently became godparents of their children, Cornelia and Alexander.         C. Z. Guest was considered one of America's classic beauties. The writer Jill Gerston once described her this way: ''With her pale skin, blue eyes, ash-blond hair and trim figure, she is cut from the same cool, silky cloth as Grace Kelly. It is a patrician beauty that is indigenous to socially registered enclaves like Palm Beach and Southampton, a sporty, outdoorsy look that eschews makeup, hairspray and anything trendy. She has an outspoken, coolly self-assured manner and a throaty, well-modulated voice with a trace of a British accent.''         In 1962, Time magazine did a lengthy article on American society and apotheosized Mrs. Guest on its cover as the model of horsy high society. She posed in front of her Long Island estate wearing a button-down shirt and tie and jodhpurs, a sleek hound at her side, the personification of old-guard chic. Truman Capote once described Mrs. Guest as the incarnation of understated elegance and said she was ''a cool vanilla lady.'' John Fairchild, then publisher of Women's Wear Daily, described her as ''Southampton, Long Island American, Ivy League blond.'' British Vogue said she had ''the face of a flower.''         Often adorned by Mainbocher, Givenchy and Adolfo, she was chosen by the New York Dress Institute as one of the best-dressed women in the world early in the 1950's and remained on the list for years until her elevation to the Fashion Hall of Fame.         Mrs. Guest was also the designer of a small fashion collection introduced in 1985 and at the time made up principally of cashmere sweaters. ''I will only sell what I like to wear,'' she said after her sweaters had been displayed flung casually around the shoulders of models at the semiannual show of the designer Adolfo. A limited sportswear line was licensed in 1986 and in 1990 she came out with a fragrant insect repellent spray and other garden products.         Lucy Douglas Cochrane was born in Boston on Feb. 19, 1920, the second of five children of Alexander Lynde Cochrane, an investment banker, and Vivian Cochrane, the former Vivian Wessell. Her father died when she was 6. She was educated by tutors and later graduated from the Fermata School in Aiken, S.C. She made her debut in 1937, and was voted the glamour girl of the Massachusetts North Shore in a contest held in 1939, which prompted a brief fling as a showgirl. She appeared in a 1943 revue on the roof of the Ritz-Carlton in Boston and in a revival of the Ziegfeld Follies on Broadway in 1944. She spent six months in Hollywood attending 20th Century Fox's studio school but never appeared in a film.         ''My ambition was to be a successful enough actress to get myself thrown out of the Social Register,'' she once said. ''I had no talent at all but I enjoyed every minute of my experience.'' It was also during this period that she took off for Mexico, where Diego Rivera painted her as a nude odalisque. When she became engaged to Mr. Guest, her portrait, which had reportedly been displayed in a Mexico City bar, was bought by her fiancé's family.         Mrs. Guest became interested in volunteer work as a debutante in Boston and was active in numerous charitable organizations over the years, including the Children's Research and Asthma Institute, the Police Athletic League and the March of Dimes.         For years she was chairwoman of the April in Paris Ball and was a favorite of society columnists, who often mentioned her lunching with such friends as Elsa Maxwell, Mrs. William Paley, Mrs. Earl Smith, Doris Duke and Estée Lauder. They also mentioned her riding in the hunt country of Virginia, taking in the polo matches at the Piping Rock Club on Long Island, working hard on her orchids in her greenhouses or walking the grounds of Templeton, her estate on Long Island, trailed by a string of hunting dogs.         During the 1930's and 40's she was one of society's leading hostesses. ''She was very comfortable with all kinds of people, which is not common for a woman who's born to the purple, so to speak,'' her friend Eppie Lederer (the advice columnist Ann Landers) once observed.         The Guests jointly owned racing stables, with Mr. Guest supervising those in Chantilly, France, and Mrs. Guest supervising others in Middleburg, Va.. She loved exercising her horses and did so most mornings. For years she competed in the leading horse shows.         In 1984, Mrs. Guest was named commissioner general of the American garden exhibit of the International Garden Festival in Liverpool, England. The project, jointly sponsored by the United States Information Agency and the United States Forest Service, was a memorial to members of the Army Air Force who were killed in World War II.         Mrs. Guest was amused when her daughter, Cornelia was hailed by Life magazine as ''the debutante of the year'' in 1982 and herself became the darling of columnists and photographers.         In addition to her son Alexander, of Hunterdon County, N.J., and her daughter, Cornelia, of Old Westbury, she is survived by two stepsons, Winston Guest of Palm Beach, and Frederick, of New York, and three grandchildren.         ''I've always felt that having a garden is like having a good and loyal friend,'' C.Z. Guest once said.

         Gertrude Ederle, who was called ''America's best girl'' by President Calvin Coolidge in 1926 after she became the first woman to swim across the English Channel, died yesterday at a nursing home in Wyckoff, N.J. She was 98.         Ederle was a symbol of the Roaring 20's, a decade given as much to heroics as to materialism. For a time, her accomplishment put her in the public's affection at the level of Babe Ruth, Jack Dempsey, Bill Tilden and Red Grange.         Ederle did not sustain the lofty place in history of another hero of the 1920's, Charles A. Lindbergh, who crossed the Atlantic a year after her historic swim, or of the golden athletes who appeared regularly before the public and kept their fame alive. But her feat, which she did only once and under horrendous conditions, made a memorable contribution in an age when many found it difficult to take female athletes seriously.         They had to take Ederle seriously, because she beat the records of the five men who had previously made the swim from 1875 to 1923.         Years later, after other men and women had successfully swum the Channel, Grover A. Whalen, New York City's official greeter, said that of all the celebrities he had welcomed to town, he could not recall one that made the impact of Ederle at her homecoming.         Ederele was born Oct. 23, 1905, in New York City, one of four daughters and two sons of Henry Ederle, a butcher and provisioner, and his wife, Anna. Her father owned a summer cottage in Highlands, N.J., and she learned to swim on the Jersey Shore.         She called herself a ''water baby'' and said that over the years, she was ''happiest between the waves.'' But she developed a hearing problem when she was 5, after a bout with the measles. ''The doctors told me my hearing would get worse if I continued swimming, but I loved the water so much, I just couldn't stop,'' she said.         In the early 1920's, as a competitive swimmer, she set women's world freestyle records and American freestyle records for various distances from 100 to 800 meters. In a single afternoon in 1922, she broke seven such records at Brighton Beach, Brooklyn. Between 1921 and 1925, she held 29 amateur national and world records.         In what might have been an anticipation of her Channel swim, she swam more than 16 miles through tricky currents between the Battery and Sandy Hook, N.J.         In 1924, she was a member of the United States team that competed in the Olympics in Paris. She won a gold medal as part of the 400-meter freestyle relay, and she won the bronze medal in the 100 and 400 individual freestyle events. It was no small accomplishment. She was swimming with an injured knee and, together with the other female athletes from the United States, she had an added handicap of fatigue. They were put up in hotels far away from the center of Paris because United States officials did not want them contaminated with what they saw as the city's bohemian morality. Ederle and her teammates had to travel five to six hours each day to practice in the Olympic pool.         After Paris, she began to focus on the English Channel. The first person to swim it was Matthew Webb of England, who in 1875 made it in 21 hours 45 minutes. Of the four other men who succeeded before Ederle, none were faster than 16 hours 33 minutes. One swimmer, Henry Sullivan of the United States, required 26 hours 50 minutes.         Ederle first tried to swim the Channel in 1925. The Women's Swimming Association provided the financial backing. But after she swam 23 miles in 8 hours 43 minutes, the people in a boat who were supposed to look after her thought she might be unconscious in the water. Somebody yelled, ''She's drowning!'' and they touched her, which immediately disqualified her.         A perturbed Ederle insisted that she had not been drowning at all, only resting, and that she could have easily continued. ''All I could wonder was, 'What will they think of me back in the States?' '' she said. She vowed to try it again and told her father and everyone else involved that no matter how she looked in the water, she did not want to be touched.         She decided not to ask the Women's Swimming Association to back her a second time and raised the needed $9,000 herself. With the help of her sister Margaret, she designed a two-piece bathing suit that would not drag in the water, yet would be ''decent in case I failed and they had to drag me out,'' she said.         Shortly after 7 a.m. on Aug. 6, 1926, Ederle, smeared with sheep grease, waded into the English Channel at Cape Gris-Nez, France. She could see a red ball on the French shore, a warning to small craft to avoid a sea that promised to be very choppy. ''Please, God, help me,'' she said.         For a while, she said she sang ''Let Me Call You Sweetheart'' to the rhythm of her stroke. In the boat that moved with her, the crew occasionally held up signs, which said things like ''one wheel,'' ''two wheels,'' enumerating parts of a car, because she had been promised a red roadster if she was successful.         Fourteen hours 31 minutes later, a world record, Ederle reached Kingsdown on the English coast. If she had been able to swim in a straight line, it would have been a 21-mile trip. But the sea was so rough, she swam no less than 35 miles. Ederle always held that her record was never broken, even though in 1950, another American, Florence Chadwick, swam the Channel in 13 hours 20 minutes. That was in a relatively calm sea, Ederle said, so it was not a fair comparison.         She was not prepared for the ticker-tape parade that New York gave her through its financial district on Aug. 27, 1926, in which an estimated two million people turned out and chanted, ''Trudy! Trudy!'' even though her family had always called her ''Gertie.'' She had to be rushed into Mayor Jimmy Walker's office in City Hall when exuberant crowds stormed the doors. She was also not prepared for the adulation she received in the weeks to come, when somebody wrote a song titled, ''Tell Me, Trudy, Who Is Going to Be the Lucky One?'' Men were proposing to her by mail almost every week.         Coolidge invited her to the White House, called her ''America's best girl,'' and said to her, ''I am amazed that a woman of your small stature should be able to swim the English Channel.'' It was a curious observation; Ederle weighed 142 pounds and soon became an adviser to a manufacturer of dresses for large women.         She was invited to join a touring vaudeville act, and there were reports that she earned $2,000 or $3,000 a week. She went to Hollywood and made a 10-minute movie about herself, for which she was paid $8,000. Various groups wanted her to speak, and the marriage proposals kept coming.         ''I finally got the shakes,'' she told an interviewer years later. ''I was just a bundle of nerves. I had to quit the tour and I was stone deaf.'' The hearing problem she had since childhood was made much worse by the Channel swim. Ederle had what was later described as a nervous breakdown.         Her encroaching deafness made her shy away from people. In 1929, she was ''practically engaged'' to one man, and suggested to him that it might be difficult being married to a woman who could not hear well. He agreed and vanished. After he left her, she said: ''There never was anyone else. I just didn't want to get hurt again.''         As the years passed, the public made fewer demands on her. The proposals stopped.         In 1933, she slipped on broken tiles in the stairwell of the apartment building in which she lived, injured her back and was in a cast for four years. Doctors told her she would neither walk nor swim again, but in 1939 she appeared in Billy Rose's Aquacade at the New York World's Fair.         Over the years, it sometimes seemed that journalists alone remembered her, and they wrote articles commemorating the 5th, 10th, 15th, 20th and 25th anniversaries of her Channel swim. She always obliged with an interview but detested the articles that tried to make her pitiable. ''Don't weep for me, don't write any sob stories,'' she told The New York Times in 1956.         When World War II began, Ederle took a job working for an airline at La Guardia Airport. She checked flight instruments used by airplanes and loved the work, she said. She quit after the war, when told she could keep the job if she moved to Tulsa, Okla.         For many years, she taught swimming to children at the Lexington School for the Deaf in New York. She did not know sign language but was able to demonstrate to them in the water what they should know about swimming. Her own deafness continued to worsen.         Although she claimed she had saved and invested well, she never made the huge amounts of money that came to celebrities in later generations. She earned some money in the 1950's lending her name to a bacteria-free swimming pool, but her income over the years was modest.         Ederle lived for many years in Flushing, Queens, with two female companions.         She is survived by 10 nephews and nieces.         ''I have no complaints,'' Ederle told one interviewer. ''I am comfortable and satisfied. I am not a person who reaches for the moon as long as I have the stars.''       
         Sylvia Sebastiani, who married the boy next door and became the matriarch and later the chairwoman of one of America's most prominent wine families, died on Sunday in Sonoma. She was 87.         Mrs. Sebastiani, who was also the author of a cookbook of family recipes, had given up day-to-day control of the Sebastiani winery several years ago because of failing health.         For 45 years, she had been known as the first lady of Sonoma, a renowned cook and hostess. She and her husband, August Sebastiani, were philanthropists whose gifts included property for the Sonoma Valley Hospital.         In 1980, she inherited Sebastiani Vineyards and Winery after the death of her husband.         In 1986, she replaced her elder son, Sam Sebastiani, who had embarked on an ambitious and costly plan to focus on higher-quality wines, as head of the winery with her younger son, Don Sebastiani.         Of the firing, which started a long family feud, Mrs. Sebastiani would say only that she loved her three children equally, but that she and Sam ''just don't make wine together.''         Under Don Sebastiani, a former state legislator, the winery prospered, expanding its brands and holdings into the Central Valley.         Sam Sebastiani established the Viansa Winery and Italian Marketplace south of Sonoma. The family eventually reconciled.         Mrs. Sebastiani was born Sylvia Scarafoni on May 10, 1916, in Cordelia, Calif., the daughter of Italian immigrants. In 1927 the family moved to Sonoma, settling in a house across the street from August Sebastiani's parents, who owned much of the town. The two families quickly became friends. The Sebastianis grew grapes and made wine. The Scarafonis kept cows and produced milk on a ranch in Schellville.         August and Sylvia were childhood sweethearts, going to school together, dating and spending Sundays at family dinners. In 1936 they married.         Until her husband's death, Mrs. Sebastiani spent much of her time in the kitchen, preparing meals for family members and wine salesmen.         Three years ago, the Sebastiani family sold its Central Valley winemaking operations and six wine brands for $295 million. The family kept the historic winery in Sonoma, with Mrs. Sebastiani's daughter, Mary Ann Cuneo, as president.         In addition to her children, she is survived by her sister, Rose Scarafoni Millerick of Sonoma; 12 grandchildren; and 7 great-grandchildren.         While Mrs. Sebastiani was chairwoman, she had an office, but she also kept a seat in the tasting room of the winery, greeting visitors and signing copies of her cookbook, ''Mangiamo: Let's Eat.''       
         Jenifer Estess, a theatrical producer who set up a foundation for research into Lou Gehrig's disease after she learned she had it, died yesterday at her apartment in Manhattan. She was 40.         The cause was amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or A.L.S., as Lou Gehrig's disease is formally known, her sister Valerie Estess said.         Ms. Estess was told in 1997 that she had the condition, a degenerative disease of the nerve cells that control muscular movement. It affects 30,000 Americans and is usually fatal within two to five years.         With friends and family members, Ms. Estess set up Project A.L.S., and, calling on her experience as a producer, she raised more than $17 million and brought together scientists from different laboratories to cooperate in the search for a cure.         The foundation paid for investigations into genetics, stem cells, gene therapy, accelerated drug testing and disease pathways. Some new approaches may help those with related conditions, like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, as well as brain and spinal cord injury, her sister said.         Jenifer Greer Estess was born on Feb. 17, 1963, in Moline, Ill., and grew up in Harrison, N.Y. After graduating from New York University with a major in drama, she worked as an actor. She helped found and was producing director of Naked Angels, a Manhattan theater company.         She then worked in public relations and helped found the Nantucket Film Festival and the New York Women's Film Festival.         Project A.L.S. has staged benefits involving show business celebrities in New York and Los Angeles, and in 2002 it arranged for Project A.L.S. Day at 14 major-league baseball stadiums. At each event, a celebrity read Gehrig's famous farewell speech, in which he declared to Yankee fans that he considered himself ''the luckiest man on the face of the earth.''         In 2001, Ms. Estess produced a movie for CBS television called ''Jenifer'' that told her own story. That year, she was named Glamour magazine's Woman of the Year.         Next May, HBO is planning to show a documentary about her.         The publication of her memoir, ''Tales From the Bed: On Living, Dying and Having It All,'' is scheduled for May.         Project A.L.S. will continue, Valerie Estess said.         In addition to her sister Valerie, who lives in Manhattan, Ms. Estess is survived by her mother, Marilyn R. Estess, of Rye, N.Y.; her other sisters, Alison Estess of Manhattan and Meredith Hulbert of Harrison; and her brother, Noah, of San Diego.       
         Elizabeth Stevenson, the first executive director of the National Brain Tumor Foundation, died on Nov. 30 in San Francisco, where she made her home. She was 57.         The cause was complications of pneumonia and of a brain tumor first diagnosed in 1979, her family said.         The foundation was formed in 1981 as a support group bringing together brain tumor patients, doctors and medical researchers. Ms. Stevenson organized the office of executive director in 1985 as the group expanded its fund-raising efforts for patient care and the search for a cure.         She stepped down in 1989 but remained a consultant and was on the board at her death.         Elizabeth Fullerton Stevenson was born in Bryn Mawr, Pa.; graduated from Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn.; and in 1968 received a bachelor's degree in history from Stanford. She worked at KQED, the public television station in Los Angeles, before heading to New York, where she became an assistant in the office of Mayor John V. Lindsay before returning to California in 1973.         There she worked for Representative Paul N. McCloskey as office manager and for Santa Clara County as director of governmental relations. From 1978 to 1982, she was director of public affairs for the Cowles Media Company in Minneapolis.         Ms. Stevenson was also a former member of the board of the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship.         She is survived by her husband, Francisco Cancino; two sisters, Sally S. Fischer, who lives in France, and Patience S. Scott of Riverhead, N.Y.; a brother, John R. Stevenson Jr. of Woodacre, Calif.; and her stepmother, Ruth Carter Stevenson of Fort Worth.         Correction:  January 1, 2004, Thursday  An obituary on Dec. 19 about Elizabeth Stevenson, the first executive director of the Brain Tumor Foundation, misstated the location of the public television station KQED, for which she once worked. It is in San Francisco, not Los Angeles.       
         Hope Lange, a film, television and stage actress noted for a natural comedic style and intelligent portrayals of women in difficult circumstances, work that brought her two Emmy Awards and an Academy Award nomination, died at a hospital in Santa Monica, Calif., on Friday. She was 70 and lived in Los Angeles.         The cause was an intestinal infection brought on by a bout of diverticulitis, according to Ms. Lange's husband, Charles Hollerith Jr.         With her naturally blond hair, lithe dancer's figure and simple, straightforward style, Ms. Lange won praise for her first film role as a young woman who befriended a temptress played by Marilyn Monroe at a bus stop in the 1956 romantic comedy ''Bus Stop.'' It was her next role, in the controversial melodrama ''Peyton Place,'' based on the Grace Metalious book of the same name about the torrid lives led behind closed doors by the residents of a picturesque New England town, that made her a star in 1957.         In the film Ms. Lange played Selena Cross, a teenage girl living in a shack on the wrong side of town, who is raped by her stepfather and is later accused of murdering him. Her earnest portrayal of the troubled high school student earned her an Academy Award nomination as best supporting actress. She went on to act alongside Montgomery Clift and Marlon Brando in ''The Young Lions'' and starred with Joan Crawford in ''The Best of Everything.''         Ms. Lange was born in November 1933 in Connecticut to show business parents -- her father was a composer and arranger, and her mother was an actress. The family moved to Greenwich Village when Ms. Lange was a small child, and soon after Ms. Lange's father died, leaving her mother to support four children on her own. Her mother opened a restaurant, and Ms. Lange worked as a waitress. One day Eleanor Roosevelt, who had an apartment in the Village, walked by with Fala, her husband's beloved Scottish terrier, said Christopher Murray, Ms. Lange's son.         Fala was so entranced by the smell of the food cooking in the restaurant that he stood stock still, Mr. Murray said, until his mistress took him inside. Ms. Lange began walking Fala for Mrs. Roosevelt, Mr. Murray said, and was discovered when her picture appeared in the newspaper. She began modeling, which led to advertising work. Her first husband, the actor Don Murray, encouraged her to try acting, her son said, and Ms. Lange eventually began acting in films and later won two Emmy Awards for her portrayal of a widow in the television series ''The Ghost and Mrs. Muir.''         Ms. Lange's two previous marriages, to Mr. Murray and to Alan J. Pakula, the film director, ended in divorce. In addition to her husband, Ms. Lange is survived by her son, Christopher, of Malibu, Calif., and a daughter, Patricia Murray of Arroyo Grande, Calif.       
         Blanche Davis Blank, a social scientist and author who led Hunter College as interim president in the early 1990's, died on Friday at her home in New Rochelle, N.Y., her family said. She was 80.         Dr. Blank, a former social science dean at Hunter and academic dean at Yeshiva University, was acting president of Hunter College from 1993 until her retirement as professor emeritus two years later.         She was a founder and, from 1972 to 1980, chairwoman of the Hunter Institute for Trial Judges. She started it with Justice Hortense W. Gabel, a Hunter graduate like her, to provide a common forum for New York's judicial, legal, civic and academic communities.         She wrote several books, most recently a report for the Fund for Peace in Washington, ''It Takes Two to Tango: International Perspectives on the United Nations'' (1998).         One of her books still in print is ''The Not So Grand Jury: The Story of the Federal Grand Jury System'' (University Press of America, 1993). Stemming from her own two-year stint on a federal grand jury, it examines the system in theory and practice, its costs, problems and, in the author's view, excessive secrecy.         She was born in Brooklyn and graduated magna cum laude from Hunter in 1944. She received an M.A. in public administration from Syracuse in 1945 and a Ph.D. in American political institutions from Columbia in 1951.         She started as a lecturer at City College and the New School and returned to Hunter as an instructor in political science in 1956. Named a full professor in 1968, she was dean of the division of social sciences from 1972 until she joined the staff at Yeshiva University in 1977.         She was the academic dean at Yeshiva until 1981 and a political science professor until 1993. That year, the trustees of the City University recalled her as Hunter's acting president, to replace Paul LeClerc, who became president of the New York Public Library. She remained at Hunter, also teaching a course, until the long-delayed arrival of David A. Caputo as the college's 12th president in 1995.         Dr. Blank is survived by her husband of 58 years, Joseph S.; three daughters, Laura, Barbara and Alice, all of Manhattan; and three grandchildren.       
         Isabelle Stevenson, the president of the American Theater Wing for more than 30 years, its chairwoman for the last five years and one of the best-known figures in the theater world, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan, her daughter Laura said. She was 90.         She was perhaps best known to the public as the doyenne of the Tony Awards, Broadway's equivalent of the Academy Awards and the American theater's most widely recognized prize. The Tony Awards were founded by the Theater Wing in 1947 and named for Antoinette Perry, a former chairwoman who ran the organization during World War II. They are jointly administered by the wing and the League of American Theaters and Producers, the trade association of Broadway theater owners and producers.         The Tony telecast, administered by a Tony Management Committee of five wing and five league representatives, means not only prestige but also money. It is shown each year just before summer vacation time, and the play that wins the Tony almost always enjoys extra tourist dollars. The Theater Wing's share of income from the award broadcast, along with fund-raising events, private contributions and membership fees, also supports its programs.         Mrs. Stevenson was responsible for several major innovations in her long tenure at the wing, which is primarily a service and education organization, building audiences for the stage as well as honoring excellence in the theater.         She inaugurated the series of ''Working in the Theater'' seminars, held twice a year at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and shown on cable television. The seminars bring together leading performers, playwrights, directors, producers and scenic and costume designers.         She also began a program of grants and fellowships to Off and Off Off Broadway theaters. Theater in Schools, begun under her auspices, sends professionals to high schools to talk about their craft and provides scholarships to high school graduates to further their theater training.         Mrs. Stevenson nurtured other Theater Wing programs, including the Hospital Program, which takes plays and cabaret shows to hospitals, nursing homes and AIDS centers and, for many years, a Theater for Children, which produced plays for thousands of New York public-school students each year. Another program, Introduction to Broadway, provides Broadway theater tickets for $2.50 to high school students in an attempt to develop the audience of the future.         For more than half a century, Tonys have been given only to Broadway plays and performers. For many of those years Mrs. Stevenson pressed for a change in rules that would permit Off Broadway plays to be eligible for Tony Awards. And for years she failed. ''When the Tonys started, there wasn't really any Off Broadway, so the rules said Broadway theaters,'' Mrs. Stevenson said frequently. ''That should be changed now. I think Off Broadway's contribution to the theater should not be ignored.'' At the time of her death, the rules still had not changed.         Mrs. Stevenson was born Isabelle Lubow in Vineland, N.J., on May 15, 1913, the daughter of Sonia Lubow and Samuel Lieberman, who were married but lived separate lives. She and her two sisters took their mother's name. The family moved from Philadelphia to Far Rockaway when she was 10 and, several years later, to Brooklyn.         At 14, to take off weight, she began dance classes in Manhattan and met Harry Foster, a producer from England who was interested in organizing a line of dancers. Young Isabelle was one of the 15 chosen for training. The group was later known as the Foster Girls and was a part of ''Earl Carroll's Vanities.'' She was picked up each night by her mother and taken home on the subway.         When the show was taken on the road, Mrs. Lubow refused to allow her daughter to travel with it. So Isabelle began doing solo dance acts in vaudeville and a short time later, formed an act with two young male dancers. The trio, billed as Nice, Florio and Lubow, played the RKO circuit, including the Palace in New York. They also played Britain and took part in a command performance for Queen Mary and King George V. Mrs. Lubow accompanied her daughter everywhere.         Mrs. Stevenson met her future husband during a booking in Australia. John Stevenson had come out from England and was working on a newspaper in Melbourne. He returned to New York as promotion manager of The New York Post, and they were married in 1937. Mr. Stevenson, later involved in marketing of books and records, died in February 2002.         ''There was no question of my working -- I wasn't Katherine Cornell or Helen Hayes,'' Mrs. Stevenson recalled in a 1997 interview, when asked why she gave up her dancing career. ''I went to the Traphagen School of Design, took dance classes and courses in journalism and then I went to work for my husband as women's editor.'' By then, there were two daughters, as well as her sister's child, whom the Stevensons treated as their own. She is survived by her daughters, Susan Brown of Manhattan and Laura Maslon of Venice, Calif.; her niece and foster daughter, Francine Ringold-Johnson of Tulsa, Okla.; two grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.         In 1956 when all the children were in school, Mrs. Stevenson joined the board of the American Theater Wing, and when Helen Menken, then the president, died in 1965, she was elected president. She stepped down to become its chairman in 1998 and the next year was honored at a tribute at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.         The Theater Wing was known as the Stage Women's War Relief Fund when it was founded in 1917. It was renamed the American Theater Wing War Service Theater in 1939 and was known for its Stage Door Canteens in Manhattan and elsewhere. After the war, the wing established not only the Tonys Awards but also the Professional Training School, a theater school for returning soldiers, which existed from 1946 to 1965.         In 1980 a caricature of Mrs. Stevenson became the 1,000th likeness to join the gallery of theatrical figures at Sardi's Restaurant. In 1999 she received a special Tony Award for lifetime achievement.         ''I stood on the sidelines for half a century and watched other people receive Tony Awards,'' she said, ''and now at last I get my own.''       
         Ann Sunstein Kheel, a civic leader and environmentalist whose posts included chairwoman of the State Parks Commission for the City of New York, died on Sunday at Columbia-Presbyterian Center in Manhattan, her family said. She was 88 and lived in Riverdale, the Bronx.         Her husband is Theodore W. Kheel, the labor mediator and lawyer. They married in 1937, the year after she graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Cornell. A native of Pittsburgh, Mrs. Kheel was a journalist and government information specialist and later became prominent in civic affairs. She was chairwoman of the State Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation Commission for the City of New York from 1977-86.         Active in the New York Urban League since the mid-1960's, she was the secretary of its board until 1990 and the founder of its annual Frederick Douglass Awards Dinner; she was the dinner's chairwoman from 1966 to 1990. She was also a former trustee of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. In public education, she spent years on panels like the Cooperative Education Commission of the City Board of Education. She was also a trustee of the nonprofit Rainforest Alliance.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Kheel's survivors include five daughters, Ellen Jacobs of Manhattan; Constance E. Kheel of Buskirk, N.Y.; Dr. Marti Kheel of El Cerrito, Calif.; Jane K. Stanley of Bethesda, Md.; and Katherine K. Fleischman of Baltimore; a son, Robert J., of Manhattan; 11 grandchildren; and one great-granddaughter.       
         Vestal Goodman, a matriarch of gospel music whose influence ranged far beyond its traditional audience, died on Saturday in Celebration, Fla. She was 74.         The Associated Press reported her death based on information from funeral home officials and her own Web site. The cause was not given.         Mrs. Goodman and her husband, Howard Goodman, known as Happy, who died last year at 81, were cofounders of the Happy Goodman Family act. Friends said Mrs. Goodman never really recovered from her husband's death.         The Happy Goodman Family, whose enthusiastic and inspirational live performances recalled early camp-meeting evangelism, formed in 1949 and was on the road constantly for 50 years. They often appeared as part of Billy Graham Crusades.         The Happy Goodman Family recorded 15 No. 1 gospel hits and played more than 3,500 concerts. The family was inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 1998.         Mrs. Goodman, who dreamed of being an opera star as a girl, brought operatic flourishes to gospel. She never forsook her signature beehive hairstyle, her floor-length beaded gowns or the white handkerchief she carried in her right hand. Fans often waved their own handkerchiefs back.         The family's music revived in popularity in the 1990's, taking its place beside the younger contemporary Christian musicians and groups.         In the 1980's, the Goodmans were featured on the ''PTL Club'' television show of Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker. They left the program in 1988, and were not linked to scandals involving the Bakkers.         The Happy Goodman Family also often featured Happy's brothers Rusty and Sam.         They were an inspiration to the current gospel great Bill Gaither, who included the Goodmans in more than 60 of his Gaither Homecoming videos, a popular series that was a precursor of music videos. Mrs. Goodman was featured on the current Gaither Homecoming tour and had been booked to continue with the tour into 2004. Her autobiography, ''Vestal!,'' was published in 1998.         The troubled country star George Jones told The Tennessean newspaper in 2002 that after he was nearly killed a few years ago in a drunk-driving accident north of Nashville, he sent for Mrs. Goodman, who came to pray with him in the hospital and became a spiritual mentor.         Mrs. Goodman is survived by a son, Rick; a daughter, Vicki; four grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.       
         Dr. Margaret Singer, a leading expert on brainwashing who testified in several high-profile cases contending that various groups inappropriately manipulated their members to control their behavior, died on Nov. 23 in Berkeley, Calif. She was 82.         The cause was respiratory failure, said her son, Sam.         In her long career, Dr. Singer investigated and testified about techniques used by North Koreans against American soldiers in wartime and the Symbionese Liberation Army's influence over the kidnapped heiress Patricia Hearst.         In the 1950's, Dr. Singer interviewed a number of American soldiers who had renounced the United States after returning from captivity in North Korea. The soldiers, she found, had been isolated and plied with propaganda, at times under the threat of physical harm.         Years later, she testified in defense of Ms. Hearst in a case that brought Dr. Singer national recognition and helped generate public curiosity about mind control.         Dr. Singer and her colleagues delved into a little known area of psychology at the trial, arguing that Ms. Hearst had helped rob a bank because she had been brainwashed to embrace the values of the Symbionese Liberation Army, which abducted her.         The group, the team argued, subjected Ms. Hearst to intensely stressful conditions, like isolating her from family and friends and locking her in a closet for six weeks, allowing its members to indoctrinate her and force a bizarre behavioral transformation.         Though Ms. Hearst was convicted, the trial bolstered Dr. Singer's reputation as an expert on mind control. In the following years, she repeatedly testified against the Unification Church, led by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon.         In one case, a libel suit against The Daily Mail of London, she argued that the church was a cult that brainwashed its members by showering them with intense affection, a process she called ''love-bombing.''         Dr. Singer said that she had interviewed hundreds of members of the church and testified that its techniques for mind control were more powerful than those used by the North Koreans on their war prisoners. The church lost its case.         ''This has put us back to the start of the road again,'' Michael Marshall, an official of the church, said at the time of the lawsuit. ''But we shall continue to fight for recognition and to show that we are a genuine religious movement.''         Dr. Singer went on to testify as an expert witness in dozens of cases against groups she described as destructive cults. Former members of the groups or the anguished families of members, like some of the people who lost relatives among the Branch Davidians in the Waco, Tex., in 1993, would often seek her advice.         Several members of the People's Temple, with Dr. Singer's help, left that group before 900 people committed mass suicide in Guyana in 1978.         Dr. Singer would often help win lawsuits against groups that former members claimed had lured them into dark, insular worlds that left them psychologically traumatized.         ''Her testimony would help people understand the clinical impact of a cult's manipulation and exploitation,'' said Dr. Richard Ofshe, a sociology professor at the University of California at Berkeley who worked with Dr. Singer for 20 years. ''There was a constant stream of people who would go into these organizations and end up in psychiatric emergency rooms.''         Dr. Singer's battles made her a target for harassment and death threats. At times, she found dead animals on her doorstep.         Margaret Thaler Singer was born in Denver and earned her bachelor's degree, master's degree and Ph.D. from the University of Denver. She became an adjunct professor at Berkeley in the 1950's.         Dr. Singer conducted several widely known studies on schizophrenia and was a renowned family therapist. She spent much of her career at Berkeley, but also taught at the University of Rochester and Albert Einstein College of Medicine, among others.         In addition to her son, Dr. Singer is survived by her husband, Dr. Jerome R. Singer; a daughter, Martha Singer, also of Berkeley; and five grandchildren.       
         Friede F. Roth, a personal representative for classical musicians, most notably the pianist Claudio Arrau, died on Friday in Manhattan, said Josephine Hemsing, a friend of Ms. Roth. She was 89 and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Roth was born near Kiev, Ukraine, in 1914 and moved to New York with her family in 1922. She studied piano, but at 17 she realized that her talents would not sustain her in a professional career. Instead she began studying musicology and literature and became a music journalist. As a writer for The Musical Courier in the 1930's she interviewed the composers Bela Bartok, Darius Milhaud and Heitor Villa-Lobos and wrote a monograph on American music from 1900 to 1940. A study of Russian music that she wrote for The Kenyon Review in 1941 focused on Stalin's repression of composers, including Shostakovich.         Ms. Roth joined the staff of the music publisher Boosey & Hawkes in 1939 and directed its publicity office until 1941, when she left to form her own publicity agency. Her first client was the mezzo-soprano Jennie Tourel. She was also Leonard Bernstein's first publicity representative. Her client roster also included the violinists Mischa Elman and Tossy Spivakovsky; the pianists Rudolf Firkusny and Geza Anda; and the conductors Fritz Reiner, Jascha Horenstein and William Steinberg.         In recent decades Ms. Roth devoted herself entirely to the career of Arrau, the Chilean pianist, and after his death in 1991 she fought tirelessly for the reissue of his dozens of recordings.         Ms. Roth's husband, Robert Sterling, died in 1978. She is survived by seven nieces, six grandnieces and eight grandnephews.         Correction:  December 17, 2003, Wednesday  An obituary on Monday about a personal representative for classical musicians misspelled her surname. She was Friede F. Rothe, not Roth.
