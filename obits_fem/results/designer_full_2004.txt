         Frances Partridge, the last of the spectacularly talented and irreverent group of British writers and artists who coalesced as the Bloomsbury group in the years before World War I, died in London on Feb. 5. She was 103.         Ms. Partridge's death was announced by her literary agency, Rogers, Coleridge & White Ltd., which said she died in her apartment. She was surrounded there by remnants of the Bloomsbury group's heyday, including their books, one of them the letters of her friend Virginia Woolf, and their art, including the painter Dora Carrington's famous portrait of Lytton Strachey.         She was one of the last firsthand chroniclers of Bloomsbury, publishing two volumes of autobiography and six volumes of her diaries, beginning when she was 78. The books captivated a public increasingly fascinated by the socialist, pacifist and intellectually superior -- not to mention sexually adventurous -- bohemians of Bloomsbury, a leafy central London neighborhood.         Her story seemed as much literature as life, even as it was lived. When Ralph Partridge and Frances Marshall fell in love in 1923, Ralph was married to Dora Carrington, who was in love with Strachey, an eminent biographer and critic. But Strachey was in love with Ralph, who, Frances wrote, was ''hopelessly heterosexual'' and could not reciprocate. All, of course, lived in the same house.         Such was life among the Bloomsbury group, whose members also included John Maynard Keynes, E. M. Forster and Roger Fry, the art historian who coined the term Post-Impressionism. The group was not a school, as is commonly understood in artistic circles, but a remarkably talented collection of intellectuals who liked to eat good French food and converse, among other activities.         Ms. Partridge was actually on the fringes of the group, somewhat distantly connected by marriage to Duncan Grant, the Post-Impressionist painter and designer, as well as by her husband's first marriage, to Carrington. Another link was Julia Strachey, Lytton Strachey's niece and Ms. Partridge's oldest friend.         Ms. Partridge survived another old friend, the Shakespearean scholar George Rylands, who died in 1999, making her the last person who experienced the Bloomsbury phenomenon close up as an adult. (Angelica Garnett, the daughter of Duncan Grant and Vanessa Bell, Virginia Woolf's sister, published a well-reviewed book about her Bloomsbury childhood, ''Deceived by Kindness,'' in 1985.)         Ms. Partridge staked her claim to Bloomsbury history by writing it down. She suggested she survived to be ''some kind of archive.''         She brought life to her account, writing of Keynes's wife, the Russian ballerina Lydia Lopokova, as ''a delightful little person,'' and likening Forster's laugh to a sneeze. She told how Fry explained ''in his beautiful deep voice why it was wicked to like peacock blue.'' Virginia Woolf, she said, had ''irresistible cracked charm.''         Frances Catherine Marshall was born in London on March 15, 1900, and was brought up on Bedford Square, in the heart of Bloomsbury. Her father was William Cecil Marshall, an architect, the runner-up in the first Wimbledon final in 1877 and a friend of Darwin. Her mother, the former Margaret Anna Lloyd, was a suffragist who took the 6-year-old Frances to a protest. Henry James, a family chum, cuddled her as a baby.         An atheist by 12, Ms. Partridge attended Bedales, a progressive school where naked swimming was allowed, except off the high dive, ''since it was 12 feet high and its occupant was visible for miles,'' she wrote.         Ms. Partridge attended Cambridge, where she went ''dancing mad'' and studied English for two years, then switched to courses she hoped would lead to a job in applied psychology. They did: she researched why waitresses drop china.         She soon took a job in a bookstore frequented by Bloomsbury figures. Among them was her future husband, Reginald Sherring Partridge, known as Ralph. A World War I hero and former Oxford rower, he was an employee of Hogarth Press, owned by Leonard and Virginia Woolf.         Frances and Ralph married in 1933, a year after Strachey died. His death had led Carrington to commit suicide. The couple were awakened by their gardener with the news, an oft-noted detail.         ''I would have thought people would find it rather dull, but they still seem fascinated,'' Ms. Partridge said in 1994, speaking of the events surrounding the ménage. ''I supposed because Carrington died for love.''         Together, the Partridges spent nine years editing the eight volumes of Charles C. F. Greville's memoirs, which recorded three British monarchs' reigns. In the years after the war, Ms. Partridge became known as a translator of French and Spanish books.         She was devastated by the deaths of her husband, in 1960, and of their son, Burgo, named for a Trollope character, three years later. She wrote of ''the black velvet oblivion I dream about.''         She is survived by her granddaughter, Sophie, and two great-granddaughters.         In 1978, at 78, she published ''A Pacifist's War,'' a memoir of the World War II years, following it three years later with ''Love in Bloomsbury: Memories,'' which led Anatole Broyard, writing in The New York Times, to conclude that the denizens of Bloomsbury may have been ''too charming for their own good.''         The books kept coming, just as her violin performances (she was an accomplished musician) continued well into her 90's. Craig Brown, a British critic who reviewed her fifth and penultimate volume of daily journals, ''Diaries: 1939-1972'' (2001), thought that the story went on a bit.         ''There are an awful lot of days when nothing of general interest really happens: someone we have never heard of drops by for lunch (full menu included) with a second person we have never heard of, and they all gossip vaguely about what a third person we never heard of thinks of a fourth person we never heard of,'' he wrote.         In 2001 another critic, Adam Nicolson, provided something of an explanation, writing that Ms. Partridge, who in her later years was sometimes compared to the Queen Mother as an English institution, lived ''her life in complete sentences.''       
         Mary Lindsay, who as John V. Lindsay's accomplished, blue-blood wife brought casual elegance and political acumen to his campaigns for New York City mayor and other offices while fiercely protecting the family's limited privacy, died yesterday in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 77.         The cause was cancer, her daughter Margaret Picotte said. Mrs. Lindsay lived in Hilton Head, S.C.         Mr. Lindsay, who was mayor from 1966 to 1973, died on Dec. 19, 2000, at age 79.         Mrs. Lindsay, whose energy was suggested by her vigorous bicycle rides in Central Park and the countless coffee hours she held during her husband's campaigns, was her husband's most trusted adviser. James Reston described her in The New York Times as ''smarter than 16 Yale men,'' and Mr. Lindsay once volunteered that she was tougher than he was.         ''You can say anything in front of Mary,'' he said in a remark quoted by Vogue magazine in 1969. ''Besides, it'll save me having to tell her all over again.''         Mrs. Lindsay preceded Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis by three years at Miss Porter's School and Vassar and redecorated Gracie Mansion in the fine manner in which the first lady had made over the White House. But Mrs. Lindsay thought designer gowns were a waste of money and bought her clothes off the shelf in department stores. Reflecting her political sagacity, she explained that locally made clothes were a critical part of the city's economy.         Her never-disguised devotion to her children struck a responsive chord with many mothers.         ''I have a strict rule,'' she said in an interview with The New York Post in 1971. ''Nothing is scheduled for me after 4 p.m. That's when Johnnie comes home from school.''         She was also protective of her husband's most precious asset, time -- not to mention his peace of mind.         ''When he needs something done I may scream around the house,'' she said in a 1969 interview with The Times. ''But when he gets home, it's all peaches and cream.''         Mary Anne Harrison was born on Oct. 30, 1926, in Richmond, Va. Her father, Randolph Carter Harrison, was a senior vice president of Central Hanover Bank and Trust Company. Her mother, the former Mary Hawes, was president of the Garden Club of America.         She and her two brothers grew up in Greenwich, Conn. She enjoyed a tomboy's life, developing a reputation for independence. She needed only three years to graduate from Vassar in 1947 with a degree in psychology.         In her last year of college, she and John met when they were members of the wedding party of Nancy Walker Bush, sister of the former president George H. W. Bush, and Alexander Ellis. Mrs. Lindsay told The Post in 1965 that she first thought Mr. Lindsay was ''horrid'' because he did not pay any attention to her.         ''Later, when we knew each other a lot better, he said he had been assigned to be very nice to the groom's younger sister,'' she said. ''I now accept that.''         In 1948, in the kitchen of his parents' home, he asked her to marry him, she said. But he maintained he was only getting a beer.         ''He still says that,'' she said. ''But I know John. If he wanted to get out of something, he would have managed.''         Before her marriage she taught at the Mary C. Wheeler School in Providence, R.I., and at the Buckley School in New York.         They were married in June 1949 and moved into a $63-a-month apartment in Stuyvesant Town in Manhattan, according to Diplomat magazine. Mr. Lindsay was making $3,600 a year with his law firm. After the couple's first two children were born, they moved into a larger Stuyvesant Town residence that cost $83 a month. Eventually, they bought a $10,000 co-op.         She at first thought she would devote herself to being a homemaker. ''I thought it would be glorious,'' she said to The Post. ''Nothing to do but clean and be a good little housewife. I was bored to death.''         She soon got a job at a nearby nursery school until her first child, now Katharine Lake, of Connecticut, was born.         In addition to her, Mrs. Lindsay is survived by two other daughters, Margaret Picotte of Florida and Anne Lindsay of Massachusetts; her son, John Jr. of Connecticut; and five grandchildren.         The demands of motherhood were soon joined by the rigors of campaigning as Mr. Lindsay won three terms as a congressman from the city's ''Silk Stocking District,'' serving from 1959 to 1965.         She described their days at Gracie Mansion as ''beginning with chaos, ending with chaos and with a slight climactic middle.''         The verbal skills of the slender, green-eyed woman were suggested by her answer when asked how she felt when her husband was described as ''the creator of all urban evil,'' by The Post in 1971. She at first snapped that people who criticized Mr. Lindsay were ignorant.         Mrs. Lindsay quickly recovered.         ''Goodness,'' she said, ''criticism is part of our heritage. It's an important feature of this country.''         Robert Price, who helped direct Mr. Lindsay's four congressional races and first mayoral campaign, once gave Mrs. Lindsay the ultimate politician's compliment. He called her ''a political force more powerful than patronage.''       
         Beatrice Riese, an abstract painter whose important collection of African art is now owned by the Brooklyn Museum, died on April 2 at the hospice at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. She was 86.         The cause was abdominal cancer, said Roger Mosesson, a friend.         Ms. Riese was born in The Hague, the Netherlands. In the 1930's she studied art in Paris, where she was first introduced to African art. In 1940, shortly before the Germans invaded France, she escaped with her parents to Africa. From there they sailed to the United States, settling in Richmond, Va. There, Ms. Riese married a Spanish anarchist she had met on the voyage. She also took art classes with Clyfford Still at Virginia Commonwealth University.         After a divorce, she moved to New York City, and supported herself and her young son by working as a textile designer. The abstract painting and drawing style she eventually developed, with its gridded geometric forms filled with finely worked calligraphic lines, suggested the patterns of woven fabric and stitchwork, as well as densely written musical notation and micrography.         In New York she studied with Will Barnet, and joined American Abstract Artists, serving as president of the organization for more than a decade. She was a member of A.I.R. gallery in Manhattan, the first nonprofit artist-run New York gallery for woman, now in Chelsea.         In a long career, she had more than two dozen solo exhibitions in museums and galleries. Her work is in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, and other institutions.         Along with African art, which she began buying in Manhattan in the 1950's, she collected Native American art. She donated work to the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts and the Snite Museum of Art at Notre Dame University, as well as to the Brooklyn Museum, which organized an exhibition of 30 of her West and Central African marks and figural sculptures in 2000.         Ms. Riese is survived by a son, Roland Villars of Richmond, Va; a sister, Renée Hubert of Long Beach, Calif.; and two grandchildren.       
         Bella Lewitzky, a modern-dance pioneer and an outspoken champion of artistic freedom, died on Friday in an assisted-care center in Pasadena, Calif. She was 88.         She had a heart attack after a stroke, said Marjorie Perces, a friend.         A fearless and tireless dancer, choreographer, teacher and cultural crusader, Ms. Lewitzky struggled to make modern dance a major art form in California and to make Los Angeles an important dance center. She campaigned passionately for government support of the arts. Yet she was undaunted by attempts to limit artistic freedom.         Ms. Lewitzky, who was politically active all her life, was called before a hearing of the House Committee on Un-American Activities in 1951 and asked to identify acquaintances who might have been members of the Communist Party. She declined to supply names, giving the punning reply, ''I am a dancer, not a singer.''         Decades later, when the National Endowment for the Arts started requiring grant recipients to sign an anti-obscenity pledge, Ms. Lewitzky and her company filed a lawsuit, and in January 1991, a federal judge found the pledge unconstitutional.         Ms. Lewitzky was born in Llano del Rio, a utopian socialist community in the Mojave Desert. Her family later settled in San Bernardino, where Ms. Lewitzky received dance and piano lessons. Dance especially fascinated her, and her love of the art grew during the 1930's, when she attended classes taught by Lester Horton, the Los Angeles area's most prominent modern dancer at that time.         She soon established herself as a charismatic performer with the Horton Dance Group, starring in highly dramatic works by Mr. Horton like ''Salome'' (1937) and ''The Beloved'' (1948), in which she portrayed a wife accused of adultery by her puritanical husband.         Other company members included Rudi Gernreich, who became an innovative fashion designer and a stage designer for some of Ms. Lewitzky's later productions, and Newell Reynolds, Ms. Lewitzky's husband, who later became an architect.         Ms. Lewitzky left Horton in 1950 to pursue an independent career. She developed a considerable reputation as a dynamic teacher, holding posts at the University of Southern California, the Idyllwild arts school (accepting an appointment there without signing its loyalty oath) and the California Institute of the Arts. She also served as a guest teacher around the world.         She directed the Los Angeles-based Bella Lewitzky Dance Company from 1966 to 1997. It first traveled to the East Coast in 1971, appearing at the American Dance Festival in New London, Conn., and the Brooklyn Academy of Music.         As a performer, Ms. Lewitzky was a fiery stage personality. Anna Kisselgoff described her in The New York Times in 1971 as ''an extraordinary artist with an astounding mastery of technique.''         But as the creator of works like ''On the Brink of Time'' (1969), ''Kinaesonata'' (1970) and ''Greening'' (1976), she favored a cooler choreographic style.         In directing her group, Ms. Lewitzky was deeply concerned about her dancers' welfare. Her company members were always fully insured, and she paid them annual salaries even when they did not perform every month of a year.         Ms. Lewitzky served on the dance panel of the National Endowment for the Arts and on the California Arts Council and was the recipient of the Dance Magazine Award, a Guggenheim Fellowship, the Tiffany Award, the National Medal of Arts, the Capezio Award and, in 1989, the first California Governor's Award for Lifetime Achievement.         Ms. Lewitzky and her husband lived in New Mexico in the 1990's but returned to Southern California in 2001. In addition to her husband, she is survived by her daughter, Nora Reynolds, a dancer, and two grandsons, Keenan and Ross McCune.       
         Ellen Auerbach, a photographer best known for innovative portraits and advertising images made during the Weimar Republic in Germany in the early 1930's, died on Friday at New York Weill Cornell Center , according to a friend, the artist Christine Graf. She was 98 and lived in Manhattan.         While in her twenties, together with her colleague and friend Grete Stern, the then Ellen Rosenberg formed a commercial photography studio in Berlin named Ringl & Pit. It was during the days of the liberal Weimar Republic, and they were intent on cracking what had been the male-dominated field of photography.         From 1929 to 1933 the two women collaboratively produced advertising, still lifes and studio portraits that reflected the energetic, experimental style of their mentor, Walter Peterhans, a professional photographer who taught at the legendary Bauhaus design school. Their pictures were part of a wave of innovation in European design and photography that today is referred to as the New Vision, and that temporarily erased distinctions between commercial and artistic motives in photography.         The partnership of Mrs. Auerbach and Ms. Stern produced offbeat, often humorous photographs, frequently of women, which were influenced by both Constructivism and Surrealism. One of their best-known advertising pictures, for a hair product called Pétrole Hahn, shows a lifelike female mannequin holding a bottle of lotion; only on close inspection is it clear that the hand in question belongs to a real woman. In their portraiture, they sometimes depicted their sitters with eyes closed or half shut, as if dreaming. In addition, they experimented with mirrors and with unusual camera angles in an attempt to disrupt familiar perspectives.         Relatively little of Ringl & Pit's work has survived, but it was reproduced and exhibited widely at the time it was made. In 1933, Mrs. Auerbach and Ms. Stern received first prize at an international exhibition in Brussels for ''Komol,'' an advertising still life constructed like a collage out of layers of paper, wire screen and artificial curls of hair.         Despite their success, the photographers closed their studio the same year, shortly after Hitler came to power. Weimar was finished. Ms. Stern and Mrs. Auerbach, who were both Jews, were among the fortunate few who realized what was happening. (''In a country with concentration camps, you cannot live,'' Mrs. Auerbach remembered, and they quickly left Germany.)         Mrs. Auerbach emigrated to Tel Aviv, London and, in 1937, the United States. Ms. Stern left for London and later Argentina.         Mrs. Auerbach continued her career as a photographer through the 1950's, although she gave up the rigors of the studio for more anecdotal and lyrical forms of documentation. She photographed the artists Fairfield Porter and Willem de Kooning with a casual directness in 1944, and in the mid-1950's accompanied Eliot Porter on a trip to photograph Mexican churches. But her interests were increasingly focused on children and the psychology of childhood development. In 1965 she began working as an educational therapist at the Educational Institute for Learning and Research in New York, where for 19 years she taught children with learning disabilities.         Ellen Auerbach was born Ellen Rosenberg in Karlsruhe, Germany, on May 20, 1906. After high school she decided to become an artist and studied sculpture for three years at an art school in Karlsruhe and, in 1928, at the Academy of Art in Stuttgart. While studying there her uncle gave her a camera, and it led her to abandon sculpture for photography, primarily because she thought she might earn a living. She sought out Walter Peterhans in Berlin, where he maintained a successful commercial studio, and asked to be his student. He agreed, and for these lessons Mrs. Auerbach was joined by another private student, Grete Stern.         The two young women quickly became fast friends. When Mr. Peterhans decided to shut down his Berlin studio and move to Dessau, they arranged to take over the premises and to operate as Ringl & Pit. According to the photographers, the studio name was simply a combination of their childhood nicknames: Grete Stern was called Ringl and Ellen Rosenberg was called Pit. But in addition, the name had the advantage of being ambiguous in terms of gender and ethnicity.         When the rise of Hitler forced the women to dissolve their partnership in 1933, Ms. Stern moved to London and opened a studio there. Mrs. Auerbach and her future husband, Walter Auerbach, a stage designer and photographer, moved to Tel Aviv, then part of Palestine, and opened a studio specializing in portraits of children. The Auerbachs were divorced in 1945. Ms. Stern died in 1999, in Buenos Aires, at age 94. Mrs. Auerbach has no immediate survivors.         Interest in her early work from the Ringl & Pit studio was kindled in this country in the 1980's, when museum curators and private collectors began to research European Modernism of the 1920's and 1930's. The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art added two Ringl & Pit prints to its collection in 1983 and in 1987 reproduced them in the book, ''Photography: A Facet of Modernism.''       
         Helen Gee, whose Limelight photography gallery in Greenwich Village in the 1950's became a pioneering blueprint for the offering and selling of photography as an art form, died on Sunday at a hospice in Manhattan. She was 85. Her death was announced by a friend, John Erdman.         Spacious and well lit, the Limelight was started in May 1954 and supported by the adjoining coffeehouse. Although a market in fine photographs was almost nonexistent, for about seven years Limelight carried on as if there were one, setting the standard for successors that came in a trickle in the early 1970's and grew into a flood by the 1990's. Ms. Gee mounted new shows at roughly five-week intervals and wrote the news releases.         Two earlier galleries -- Alfred Stieglitz's 291 early in the 20th century and Julien Levy's in the 1930's -- had tried to sell photographs but without success. Limelight did somewhat better. An Atget show, with the prints made by Berenice Abbott and priced at $20 each, was almost a sellout. More than half the pictures in an Edward Weston exhibition, at $75 a print, were bought. But rare photographs, photograms and photomontages by Laszlo Moholy-Nagy (priced between $100 and $200) failed to sell. Prints by Robert Frank ($25 each) and Julia Margaret Cameron ($65 each) found only a few buyers. Limelight was the showcase for a wide variety of photographic styles, from classic straight photography (Ansel Adams, Imogen Cunningham) to social documentary (Brassai, Lisette Model, W. Eugene Smith) and subjective and experimental work (Rudolph Burckhardt, Harry Callahan, Aaron Siskind). Such a roster differed sharply from the generally homogeneous fare found in popular picture magazines like Life and Look.         Before opening Limelight, Ms. Gee had been a successful retoucher of color transparencies. She briefly took photography courses with Alexey Brodovitch, Model and Sid Grossman. But what Ms. Gee lacked in coffeehouse experience, she made up for in iron determination, familiarity with the Village art and photography worlds, and personal charm.         In her 1997 memoir, ''Limelight: A Greenwich Village Photography Gallery and Coffeehouse in the 50's'' (University of New Mexico Press), Ms. Gee recalled with wry humor and unsentimental directness her struggles with freeloading drug addicts, the lack of adequate help, the threat of bankruptcy as well as brutish union officials.         Writing in The New York Times Book Review, Mary Cantwell described how Ms. Gee ''had to survive a crooked contractor, a plague of city inspectors, hours in the Bowery's restaurant supply stores and an inundation of Seven Sisters graduates and dropouts all looking to be doing 'something' that would bring them closer to the arts.''         Helen Charlotte Wimmer was born on April 29, 1919, in Jersey City. Her father, Peter Wimmer, had trained in Europe as a church decorator. Settling in New York, he supported his family by painting apartments.         At 16, Helen left home to live in Greenwich Village with Yun Gee, a Chinese modernist painter she had met through an art teacher. They were married in 1942. When Yun Gee, subsequently found to be schizophrenic, threatened to turn violent, Ms. Gee left with their infant daughter, Li-lan.         With a child to support, she taught herself transparency retouching, which paid well. By the early 1950's, with leading magazines and advertising agencies for clients, she could afford a secretary, private school for Li-lan and designer clothes. It was during a visit to the Museum of Modern Art that Ms. Gee came across a photography show and was instantly hooked.         Financial and labor pressures forced Ms. Gee to close the Limelight's doors on Jan. 31, 1961. She then became an art consultant and also started to revive interest in Yun Gee's work. When the photography market began to heat up in the late 1970's, Ms. Gee returned to photography, this time as a curator, lecturer and writer.         In late 2001 and early 2002, Ms. Gee offered her collection of photographs for exhibition and sale, first at the Stephen Daiter Gallery in Chicago and then at the Sarah Morthland Gallery in New York. Most of the prints had been given to Ms. Gee by photographers whose work had appeared at Limelight.         Ms. Gee's second marriage, to Kevin Sullivan, ended in divorce. Besides her daughter, Li-lan Gee, an artist who lives in Easthampton, L.I., she is survived by a sister, Ellen Berland, of Warren, Conn., and a brother, Henry Wimmer, of Bath, N.Y.

In late 2001 and early 2002, Ms. Gee offered her collection of photographs for exhibition and sale, first at the Stephen Daiter Gallery in Chicago and then at the Sarah Morthland Gallery in New York. Most of the prints had been given to Ms. Gee by photographers whose work had appeared at Limelight.         Ms. Gee's second marriage, to Kevin Sullivan, ended in divorce. Besides her daughter, Li-lan Gee, an artist who lives in Easthampton, L.I., she is survived by a sister, Ellen Berland, of Warren, Conn., and a brother, Henry Wimmer, of Bath, N.Y.
