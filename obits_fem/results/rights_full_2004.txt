         Maxine Postal, the Suffolk County legislative leader who resigned her post this week because of failing health, died Thursday in a hospice in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., where she also had a home. She was 61 and lived in Amityville, N.Y.         In announcing her resignation, which took effect a day before her death, Ms. Postal cited her recent diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rapidly spreading brain disorder. Her death was reported yesterday by her press secretary, Kara Hahn.         One of the highest-ranking elected officials in the county, Ms. Postal was first voted into the county Legislature 15 years ago. A Democrat, she championed equal rights for women, environmental protection, and programs for children, the elderly and the poor.         She was chosen as presiding officer for a one-year term last year by a coalition of Democrats and Republicans. As such she was in a position to shape the legislative agenda, name committee chairmen and preside at meetings of the 18-member body.         As her illness progressed in recent months, her duties often fell upon the deputy presiding officer elected alongside her, Joseph Caracappa, a Republican from Selden. The Republican caucus designated him last month to succeed her as presiding officer.         Born Maxine Levy in Brooklyn on Nov. 24, 1942, Ms. Postal was a 1962 fine-arts graduate of Brooklyn College, where she also received an M.A. in fine arts in 1965. She taught at public junior high and high schools in Brooklyn for six years before opening the Busy Bee Nursery School and Kindergarten there in 1968.         After moving to Long Island, she owned and directed the Busy Bee nursery in Amityville from 1976 to 1990, when the press of her community work and public service prompted her to sell the business.         She served as president of the Hauppauge Library Board in the 1970's and was a vice president of the Amityville Board of Education from 1984 to 1988.         In 1987 she was elected to the County Legislature. She served as minority leader and headed the Health Services Committee, the Human Services Committee and the Senior Citizens Committee.         In 2002 she was the vice chairwoman of the Finance and Fiscal Services Committee.         Ms. Postal is survived by two sons, Army Lt. Gregory J. Postal of Silver Spring, Md., and Dr. Eric S. Postal of Albany; a sister, Deborah Gitelman of Orangeburg, N.Y.; and her companion, Elie Mystal of Amityville. Her marriage to Jeffrey L. Postal ended in divorce.       
         Alexandra Ripley, a writer of historical fiction who was best known for ''Scarlett,'' the officially sanctioned sequel to ''Gone With the Wind,'' died on Jan. 10 at her home in Richmond, Va. She was 70.         Her daughter, Elizabeth Lyon Ripley, told The Associated Press that death resulted from unspecified natural causes.         Ms. Ripley had written five novels before the estate of Margaret Mitchell selected her in the early 1990's to pick up the stories of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler where Mitchell left them in 1936, the year her saga of the Civil War was published. Mitchell died in 1949.         The selection of Ms. Ripley was mired in controversy from the beginning, in part because it was less than clear that Mitchell, who refused to write a sequel herself, would have wanted anyone else to try.         Ms. Ripley made no bones about why she wanted the assignment.         ''There are two reasons why I'm doing this book,'' she said in an interview in the reference work Contemporary Authors. ''I can't resist it, and as soon as this is done I will be able to write anything I want to.''         ''Scarlett,'' which was universally panned by critics, was a considerable commercial success.         In her review for The New York Times in September 1991, Janet Maslin characterized the book as a ''stunningly uneventful 823-page holding action.''         The Ripley version takes the story from Atlanta to Tara to Charleston to Savannah to Ireland, where Scarlett remarks, ''My stars, this country's positively peppered with castles.''         It engineers at least a temporary reconciliation with Rhett, with Scarlett even cooking breakfast for him, but such touches led many reviewers to say the characters seemed to have mellowed in ways never suggested by the original book.         After a bidding war, Warner Books won the rights to publish the novel for $4.94 million.         Despite the poor reviews, ''Scarlett'' catapulted to the top of the best-seller list.         Over the years, sales have remained steady, according to Warner Books, with millions of copies in print in both hardcover and paperback.         CBS bought the television rights to ''Scarlett,'' which was presented as an eight-hour mini-series in 1994.         ''Thanks to Miss Mitchell and 'Scarlett,' right now I can say any damn thing I want to, and people will listen,'' Ms. Ripley told those attending the 1991 Southeastern Booksellers Association convention.         Alexandra Ripley was born Jan. 8, 1934, in Charleston, S.C., the only child of Alexander and Elizabeth Braid. She attended the Ashley Hall School in Charleston and graduated from Vassar College in 1955, majoring in Russian.         Although she had always aspired to be a writer, Ms. Ripley did not work up the courage to become a novelist until she had tried a number of other jobs, including manuscript reader and publicity director.         Her first novel, ''Who's That Lady in the President's Bed?,'' was published by Dodd/Mead in 1972 under the pseudonym B. K. Ripley.         After the publication of ''Scarlett,'' Ms. Ripley wrote other novels that drew better reviews, including ''From Fields of Gold,'' published by Warner Books in 1994, and ''A Love Divine,'' a novel about Joseph of Arimathea, published by Warner Books in 1996.         Ms. Ripley was legally separated from John Graham of Charlottesville, Va. She is survived by her daughter Elizabeth, another daughter, Merrill Ripley Geier, and a granddaughter, all of Richmond.       
         Uta Hagen, the formidable and wide-ranging stage actress who electrified audiences with her Tony Award-winning performance as the ferocious, tart-tongued Martha in the original Broadway production of Edward Albee's ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' in 1962, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan, her daughter, Leticia Ferrer, said. She was 84.         Over seven decades, Ms. Hagen acted in Shakespeare, Chekhov and Shaw, as well as in plays by Mr. Albee and Tennessee Williams. With her husband Herbert Berghof (who died in 1990), she ran the HB Studios in Manhattan and was celebrated not only as an actress but also as a teacher of acting and author of books on the subject. She continued to teach after a stroke and until several months before her death. Occasionally she appeared in films and on television, but principally her life was onstage, and it was there that she was able to incarnate the widest diversity of characters.         Ms. Hagen made her professional debut in 1937 playing Ophelia to Eva Le Gallienne's Hamlet, and was acclaimed for her Nina (in ''The Seagull''), Desdemona (opposite Paul Robeson's Othello), Shaw's St. Joan, Blanche DuBois in ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' and as the title character in ''The Country Girl'' by Clifford Odets. Mr. Albee's Martha became her signature role.         It was a long journey from Ophelia to Martha, but one that she traveled with an unmatchable authority and an intuitive sense of character. Whether she was playing a saint or a termagant, she anchored each role with a firm base in reality. Despite her onstage strength, she said she always considered herself ''a vulnerable actress.'' Once asked what qualities an actress needed to play Martha, Ms. Hagen said, ''Intelligence, voluptuousness and hypersensitivity,'' and then added, ''wit'' -- all of which she had in abundance.         In a recent interview, Mr. Albee recalled her ''extraordinary performances as Desdemona in 'Othello' and Martha in 'Virginia Woolf,' '' and praised Ms. Hagen first as ''a profoundly truthful actress'' and then as ''a dedicated and demanding teacher.''         ''I should add,'' he said, ''she was a great anti-hypocrite, and a superb cook -- not a bad friend to have.''         In 1999, she called her whole goal as an actress ''the spontaneity that comes without planning.'' Whenever possible, she uncovered the drama behind the comedy -- or the comedy behind the drama. As she said, ''Somebody with wit and a sense of humor sees the most tragic event without the sentimentality, sees in any life experience something ludicrous -- which is probably why Chekhov is my favorite.''         She believed a performance should change in the course of the run, depending on the identity of the other actors, the audience response and the actress's mood and temperament. She played Blanche opposite Marlon Brando, Anthony Quinn (her favorite), Ralph Meeker, Richard Kiley and Jack Palance. ''If you go on with another actor and your performance doesn't change, you're a bad actor.''         In contrast to many other actors, she loved long runs: ''After a couple of months,'' she said, ''it really starts to get in my bones.'' On keeping a part alive, she called Laurette Taylor her guide. She saw her play Amanda in ''The Glass Menagerie'' 10 times, saying, ''Ten different exciting performances -- to me, that is the magic of the theater.''         Uta Hagen was born in Göttingen, Germany, on June 12, 1919. Her father named her after a 13th-century statue he saw in a Nuremburg cathedral. When Uta was 7, the family moved to Madison, Wis., where her father was head of the department of art history at the University of Wisconsin (her mother was an opera singer). From the age of 6, when she saw Elisabeth Bergner play Shaw's ''St. Joan'' in Berlin, she wanted to be an actress. She studied briefly at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, and at the University of Wisconsin, and left college -- and left home -- to pursue an acting career.         In 1937, Le Gallienne was preparing to play Hamlet in a production in Dennis, Mass., and was having difficulty finding an Ophelia. Ms. Hagen sent a letter requesting an audition. As Le Gallienne recalled in her autobiography, her impulse was to refuse, but something in the letter encouraged her to invite the young actress to audition.         ''She was very young -- only just 17 -- a tall, rather gawky creature, by no means pretty, but with a face that one remembered,'' Le Gallienne wrote, adding she had ''the shy ungainly grace of a young colt.'' For her audition, Ms. Hagen acted the end of the trial scene from ''St. Joan,'' ''quite badly,'' Le Gallienne said, ''and yet I sensed in her an inner truth that very occasionally filtered through in a word or a look.'' She told her to go and think about the role and return in an hour.         ''The improvement was startling,'' Le Gallienne said, ''The truth that had glimmered so faintly in the first reading now blazed up strongly, and the overall effect was strangely moving.'' She cast her.         In the dress rehearsal, she said, ''the sacred fire struck, and the child Uta was transported to a region which I well knew she would not set foot in again for many years to come.'' And so, just 18, Ms. Hagen made her professional debut as Ophelia, an Ophelia that was several inches taller than Hamlet.         She then joined Le Gallienne's theater company, which was preparing a production of ''The Seagull.'' The director was playing the role of Nina, with Ms. Hagen as her understudy. That production never came to fruition, but soon Ms. Hagen heard that Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne were about to do it on Broadway.         At the audition, Lunt told her to do something simple, not classical and nothing from ''The Seagull.'' She had planned to do the last scene from ''A Doll's House,'' but at the last minute decided to do Nina anyway. ''I played the whole last scene as Nina alone, without a Konstantin present,'' she recalled, ''and I came offstage in a daze.'' As she headed out the stage door, she was called back, and Lunt (who was playing Trigorin) rehearsed with her long into the night, and then told her she had the part. Ms. Hagen's Broadway debut came the next year as Nina in Lunt and Fontanne's ''Seagull.'' In his review in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson singled her out for praise as ''grace and aspiration incarnate.''         That summer, working in Ridgefield, Conn., she acted in ''The Latitude of Love,'' opposite José Ferrer. In the course of the play, she was required to knock him down. Several months later they were married. During their 10-year marriage, they appeared together in several plays, including ''Angel Street.''         Ms. Hagen is survived by their daughter, Leticia, known as Lettie, of New York City; a granddaughter; and a great-granddaughter.         Ms. Hagen said she considered the period between 1938 and 1947 as ''the transitional years of my career, during which I lost my way and a love of acting until I finally regained it to begin a true life in the theater.'' During that time, she acted in seven Broadway plays, including ''Key Largo'' (with Paul Muni) and ''Othello'' (with Robeson as Othello and Ferrer as Iago). The turning point, she said, was in 1947 when Harold Clurman directed her in ''The Whole World Over.'' The play was forgettable, but she greatly admired Clurman as a director and teacher, and it was in that play that she met Berghof, who replaced another actor in the company.         Having divorced Ferrer, she married Berghof and the two dedicated themselves to teaching actors in their HB Studio, on Bank Street in Greenwich Village. In subsequent years, teaching young actors became as important to her as her own acting. In one of her books, ''A Challenge for the Actor,'' she disagreed with Shaw's pronouncement ''He who can does. He who cannot teaches.'' For her, ''Only he who can should teach.''         In 1948, she led the national company of ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' and then followed Jessica Tandy in the role on Broadway. In 1950 she played the title role in ''The Country Girl.'' For that performance, she won her first Tony.         The next year, she finally played St. Joan, in Margaret Webster's production. Always outspoken about politics and human rights, Ms. Hagen was blacklisted in the 1950's, and, she said, ''that fact kept me pure.'' Unable to work in the movies or on television or to tour plays through the United States, she continued to focus her attentions on New York theater. She was a member of the Phoenix Theater, but her acting became more sporadic.         Then, in 1962, the call came to return to the stage. The producer Richard Barr and his partners were bringing a new play by a new playwright to Broadway, ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' by Edward Albee, and they were searching for an actress to play the central role. Ms. Hagen read the play between classes and it so gripped her that she taught her final class, she said, ''in a daze.'' Immediately she agreed to do it, and when she met the playwright she told him the play was ''like a great modern Bosch canvas.''         In the play a faculty couple, George and Martha (Arthur Hill and Ms. Hagen) engage in a long night of mutual abuse -- and revelation. Ms. Hagen's performance galvanized the play. ''Virginia Woolf'' was a turning point for the actress and for Mr. Albee. The play received five Tonys, including awards for both Ms. Hagen and Mr. Hill. In 1964, they both did the play in London.         In the years that followed, Ms. Hagen occasionally ventured back into theater. In 1968, she played Mme. Ranevskaya in Le Gallienne's A.P.A. ''Cherry Orchard.'' Later she did Peter Hacks's ''Charlotte'' (in which she played Goethe's mistress), Shaw's ''You Never Can Tell'' and ''Mrs. Warren's Profession,'' Nicholas Wright's ''Mrs. Klein'' and, in 1998, Donald Margulies's ''Collected Stories.''         After playing Martha on Broadway and London and making a recording with the original cast, she did not return to the role -- until 1999.         In a single performance for the benefit of the HB Playwrights Foundation, she played Martha once more in a staged reading on Broadway. Jonathan Pryce played George and Matthew Broderick and Mia Farrow were the couple's two guests.         At 80, she was aware of the pitfalls. ''It's a terrible risk for me,'' she said. ''I'm 28 years too old for the part. I was 42 when I played it. Martha's supposed to be 52. People have such incredible memories of my performance. I don't see how anybody could possibly live up to it, certainly not me, almost 40 years later.''         But once she came onstage, and said Martha's first line: ''Jesus H. Christ,'' followed by her imitation of Bette Davis saying ''What a dump,'' and as she pitched into verbal battle with her husband, the intervening years passed in a cloud.         Correction:  January 29, 2004, Thursday  An obituary of the Broadway actress and drama teacher Uta Hagen on Jan. 15 misidentified the German city where the cathedral is the site of a statue for which she was named. It is Naumburg, not Nuremberg.       
         Mary Jean Crenshaw Tully, a founding strategist of modern feminism and former president of the National Organization for Women's Legal Defense and Education Fund, died on Dec. 27 at White Plains Hospital. She was 78 and lived in Armonk, N.Y.         The cause was a heart attack, said her daughter, N. Linsey Tully.         Mary Jean Tully was an architect and mainstay of the feminist movement that regained momentum in the 1970's. She was most recently a board member and adviser of the Veteran Feminists of America, a gathering of the ''Second Wave'' of the movement.         She was a co-founder of the Westchester chapter of NOW and went on to head the group's national legal arm from 1971 to 1977.         From 1971 to 1981 she was president of the Fund for Women's Rights, founded by Betty Friedan to lobby for the Equal Rights Amendment and other women's rights issues. She founded the Midlife Institute at Marymount Manhattan College and directed it from 1981 to 1986.         In the late 1980's, Ms. Tully gave financial support to the Tully Crenshaw Feminist Oral History Project, which collects interviews with those active in the movement. It became part of the Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America at the Radcliffe Institute at Harvard.         Ms. Tully started it as the History of NOW and Betty Friedan Project, and it led to reunions of those active in the organization's early days, which in turn gave rise to the Veteran Feminists of America, founded in her Manhattan apartment. Now based in Lafayette, La., it tracks the movement's early adherents and keeps them informed through a Web site, www.vfa.us.         Ms. Tully was also a founder and past co-chairwoman of the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy and a founding member of the New York State National Women's Political Caucus.         Mary Jean Crenshaw, an Army brat, was born in Fort Sill, Okla., and educated at Stanford University, the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Chicago before she received a master's degree in sociology at Wayne State University. She raised five children and lectured in sociology at Long Island University, Brooklyn, for several years in the late 1960's.         Her involvement with social issues began in the late 1940's, when she was active in the N.A.A.C.P. in Schenectady, N.Y. In 1952, while living in Kansas, she began an association with the League of Women Voters.         Ms. Tully's 1947 marriage to C. Robert Tully, also of Armonk, ended in divorce in 1991. She is survived by three sons, Bruce C., of Manhattan; Scott P., of Pleasantville, N.Y.; and Andrew G., of San Francisco; two daughters, N. Linsey, of Manhattan and Laura L., of Lexington, Mass.; a sister, Carolyn Griffin of San Antonio; and six grandchildren.       
         MARIE C. WILSON, the president of the Ms. Foundation for Women, has the comportment of a seasoned politician. One of the sharper ones. She speaks with passion and laser-beam focus in a soft Georgia accent. Perhaps this impression is enhanced by that snappy red blazer, so bold and camera ready. Maybe it's the good political hair. It stays in place.         In this election year, does she wish she were out there? ''No,'' she says in a quick breath, eager to steer the chat back to her campaign with the White House Project, a nonpartisan group focused on getting women into leadership roles, up to the presidency. Besides, Ms. Wilson, who is 63, has been there, done that. Twenty years ago, she left a seat on the Des Moines City Council, where she got encouragement to run for governor, to lead the Ms. Foundation, which finances hundreds of programs to advance the rights of women and girls.         This brings us to the subject of the white bowler, emblazoned with ''Madame President'' in red, white and blue, propped on Ms. Wilson's computer in her comfortable office on Wall Street. What's with the hat?         Ms. Wilson is convinced that it won't be long before a woman is in the Oval Office. Perhaps in this decade. She thinks this even with nary a woman among the current pack since the withdrawal of Carol Moseley Braun, whom she praises highly.         She rubs her slender hands together fiercely, as if kindling fire. ''This is our time,'' she says. ''I think by 2008, we're going to see several women in the race.'' As president of the five-year-old White House Project, she hopes to recruit and train 1,000 women to become political leaders, and to enlist 25,000 women to get out the vote this year. She hopes to find these women by teaming with sister groups across the country. (She has contacts!)         So getting back to the presidency, who can we expect four years from now? Hillary Rodham Clinton? ''The common thinking is about Hillary Clinton, but there are other women, great women governors out there,'' says Ms. Wilson, a Democrat. She mentions two Democrats, Gov. Janet Napolitano of Arizona and Gov. Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas, and a Republican senator, Kay Bailey Hutchison from Texas.         ''I think we will see two or three women running,'' she continues. ''And that's the point, to get enough women running so they are seen and they're evaluated on their agenda, not just gender, because numbers matter. One woman is always hair, hemline and husband. She has to prove she is man enough for the job.''         One might be tempted to say good luck.         Yet in 1993, people didn't take Ms. Wilson seriously when she had this notion to get parents to take their daughters to their workplaces to focus attention on their potential, not on their problems. Take Our Daughters to Work Day now has the participation of about 15 million adults annually.         ''People would tell us, 'I've always trusted you, but that's the nuttiest thing I've heard,''' she says.         Let's just say, in women Ms. Wilson trusts. She goes into this more in her book, ''Closing the Leadership Gap: Why Women Can and Must Help Run the World,'' due out next month from Viking Press. It is a call to action.         ''Think about what is going on in the country: terrorism, corporate greed,'' she says. ''These are things people are so concerned about that they are glued on the election. And what's an intervention that might have the most positive outcomes? It is bringing in a critical mass of women, a diversity of women, so you get some really different perspectives at the table so we can have different solutions.''         When Ms. Wilson arrived at the Ms. Foundation, there were four staff members and a $500,000 annual budget. The foundation now has a budget of $11 million and 40 employees. One is a man, a receptionist.         SHE describes her life as that of an ordinary American woman. Raised in segregated Atlanta, the daughter of a typesetter and a dental hygienist, she was high school homecoming queen and a cheerleader. She became immersed in civil rights after studying philosophy at Vanderbilt University. Her passion was stoked by a childhood incident in which a white bus driver dragged her crying from the back of the bus where she sat with her black baby sitter.         She married a man who became a minister of music, and followed him to churches in Delaware, Pennsylvania and Iowa, where she developed women's programs at Drake University. Later, she became an educator and human resources director for the Iowa Bankers Association. Her family grew to five children. She divorced. She came to New York to lead the Ms. Foundation.         ''I ended up loving a woman,'' she says simply. ''My relationship is wonderful.''         Her partner of 15 years is Nancy A. Lee, a vice president for business development at The New York Times, and they live in Manhattan.         One senses she would rather keep her private life private. The conversation turns to topics of the day. Same-sex marriage? ''The most important thing is really having the rights,'' she says. ''It's not about the marriage. It's having the same rights that you would get if you were married.''         She is asked if she thinks the foundation, created in 1972, is as relevant today as it was then. Of this, she has no doubt. ''Whether you look at the glass ceiling or the sticky floor, we're still there,'' she says. ''We've stayed in the game.''         PUBLIC LIVES  Correction:  February 19, 2004, Thursday  A Public Lives profile on Tuesday about Marie C. Wilson, president of the White House Project, which is trying to involve more women in leadership roles, misstated the type of hat, emblazoned with ''Madame President,'' that sits atop Ms. Wilson's computer. As the picture showed, it is a boater, with a flat crown and brim, not a bowler, which would have a round crown and curved brim.       
         Trude Wenzel Lash, inspired by Eleanor Roosevelt to become a children's advocate through the Citizens Commission for Children of New York, died on Wednesday at her home in Greenwich Village, her family said. She was 95.         Mrs. Lash was an early mainstay of the commission, which Mrs. Roosevelt helped found in 1944. Mrs. Lash, a refugee from Germany who befriended Eleanor and Franklin D. Roosevelt, became the commission's program director in 1946 and was its executive director from 1952 to 1972.         After that, Mrs. Lash devoted herself to the Roosevelt legacy through the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute in Hyde Park, N.Y. Until 2000, she was the institute's co-chairwoman with Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., and at her death both were honorary chairmen of the institute, housed at the Franklin Roosevelt Library.         Trude Lash was born Gertrud Wenzel in June 1908 in Freiburg, Germany. A rebellious girl and brilliant student, she was thrown out of convent school, went on to study journalism in Berlin and, while teaching kindergarten and first grade, attended the University of Heidelberg.         At the University of Freiburg, she received a doctorate in philosophy in 1930. She came to New York for a year as an exchange teacher of philosophy and German literature at Hunter College while doing graduate work in the social sciences at Columbia.         Back in Germany, she wrote for a newspaper opposed to the Nazis. But in 1932 she returned to New York for good as the wife of Eliot D. Pratt, a member of a socially prominent family, and the couple helped other refugees from Europe find their way to the United States. They were divorced in 1943, and he died in 1969.         In 1944, she married Joseph P. Lash, a journalist and confidant of Eleanor Roosevelt, who played matchmaker to the couple. Mr. Lash wrote the two-volume biography ''Eleanor and Franklin,'' published in 1972.         Mrs. Lash, who worked for the Human Rights Commission at the United Nations before joining the staff of the Citizens Commission for Children, collected data on the status of children in New York for major studies in 1976 and 1980. She was principal investigator for the studies' reports, called ''State of the Child: New York City I and II.'' The reports were influential in inspiring similar studies elsewhere.         After retiring, she continued her advocacy through the Foundation for Child Development and became directly involved in the Roosevelt memorials. After Mrs. Roosevelt's death in 1962, Congress had authorized an Eleanor Roosevelt Institute. Mrs. Lash helped establish the combined Franklin and Eleanor Institute in 1984 and until just before her death remained a consultant on Roosevelt memorabilia.         Trude Wenzel Lash is survived by three sons, Dr. Peter W. Pratt of Bridgewater, Conn., Roger S. Pratt of New Milford, Conn., and Jonathan Lash of Washington; a daughter, Vera C. Pratt, also of Washington; a brother, Heinz Wenzel of Germany; 11 grandchildren, and 4 great-grandchildren. Joseph Lash died in 1987.         Her commission work, which ranged from studying day care and foster care to juvenile detention, often involved sending volunteers to institutions to see how children were treated. It sometimes led to confrontations with officialdom.         ''All too often we take our most difficult children and we turn over their care to professionals, and we leave the matter,'' Trude Lash said in an interiew with The New York Times in 1972. ''But professionals, even good ones, are primarily interested in their jobs and their routines. What is needed is someone who is primarily interested in the children.''         Correction:  February 7, 2004, Saturday  An obituary yesterday about Trude Wenzel Lash, an advocate for children in New York City, misstated the name of the organization for which she worked until 1972. It is the Citizens Committee for Children of New York, not Citizens Commission. Because of an editing error, the obituary also misstated the name of the organization for which she later worked on reports called ''State of the Child: New York City I and II.'' It is the Foundation for Child Development, not the committee.       
         Jane Wood, a longtime tenant advocate and political radical in New York who once pressured her landlord to replace a broken elevator by sleeping on an air mattress in the lobby, died on Wednesday at her apartment in Manhattan. She was 96.         Ms. Wood died from respiratory complications stemming from a fall last month in which she fractured a rib, said her stepson, Timothy Wood.         Considered a giant in the tenants' rights movement, Ms. Wood was credited by housing advocates for helping to prevent the eviction of hundreds, if not thousands, of tenants, as her Chelsea neighborhood became gentrified. She was the founder of the Chelsea Coalition on Housing, an advocacy group for low-income tenants, and could always deliver a rousing speech at tenant protests, Rent Guidelines Board meetings or neighborhood rallies.         Ms. Wood was one of the last of a breed of activists whose socialist sensibilities were shaped by the Depression, though not through personal deprivation. Ms. Wood was born into a family of means, a world she eventually rejected to help the downtrodden.         Born Janet Kauffman in 1907, Ms. Wood grew up in St. Louis as the only child of Harold M. Kauffman, a wealthy banker, and Jeanette Morton, a socialite and Mayflower descendant. She was related to the Davis family, the namesake of the Davis Cup of tennis. And while Ms. Wood attended Smith College, her sorority mentor was Anne Morrow, the writer who later married Charles A. Lindbergh, her stepson said.         After moving to New York City in the 1930's, Ms. Wood became active in socialist causes and tried to help the poor. ''She felt that what she saw was terrible, and she felt that she had to do something for those less fortunate,'' Mr. Wood said.         In the 1940's, she married Robert Wood, a fellow activist, who later opened a business importing cigars. He died in 1963. Ms. Wood is survived by her stepson and a stepdaughter, Sara Gearry, of Coeburn, Va.         Because of her husband's cigar business, Ms. Wood traveled to Cuba. She made numerous trips there after the embargo was imposed, ferrying medical supplies and other goods. She met Fidel Castro as well, and to the end praised his communist regime, said Kernan Huttick, treasurer and tenant organizer with the Chelsea Coalition on Housing.         Ms. Wood founded the Chelsea group in the 1950's after protesting plans to build the Penn Station South housing development, a middle-income cooperative. The complex ultimately went up, but Ms. Wood helped ensure that the low-income workers who lost their homes were given priority in the new housing.         In the 1990's, one of Ms. Wood's notable fights involved the eviction of several women living at Leo House, a women's residence affiliated with Catholic Charities. Though Leo House ultimately won the fight, the evictions were stalled for several years.         In 2001, Ms. Wood staged what may have been her most colorful protest: sleeping in the lobby of her apartment building to pressure the landlord to hasten the replacement of the elevator, which at that point had been out of service for months. She installed an air mattress in the lobby and went to bed there in a nightgown and nightcap.       
         Odessa Edwards, a Southern gospel singer known for her passionate and topical sermonizing with the Original Gospel Harmonettes, died on Feb. 22 in Birmingham, Ala., where she lived.         The cause was complications from a stroke, her granddaughter, Tausha Riley, said. Ms. Riley said Ms. Edwards's exact age was not known, though she was believed to be in her 80's.         Ms. Edwards was the clear-voiced contralto of the Original Gospel Harmonettes, which featured the dynamic lead singer Dorothy Love Coates.         Though Ms. Edwards rarely sang the lead, she specialized in the spoken sermon parts that were a feature of the group's recordings and live performances. In her sermons, delivered while the other members of the group harmonized smoothly in the background, Ms. Edwards spoke of hope and faith in the face in adversity.         Speaking in biblical metaphors, she sometimes addressed the struggle for civil rights. Anthony Heilbut, the author of ''The Gospel Sound: Good News and Bad Times,'' said Ms. Edwards was ''perhaps the first and certainly the most notable advocate of civil rights'' in gospel, and that others, including Ms. Coates, spoke of segregation and racism, ''but Edwards spoke earliest, and with the most passion.''         The group, originally known as the Harmoneers, was founded in 1941 by Ms. Edwards, Evelyn Starks Hardy, Mildred Miller Howard, Vera Kolb and Willie Mae Newberry.         They changed their name to the Original Gospel Harmonettes in the late 40's, and Ms. Coates joined in 1950 as the lead singer. The group toured widely, and its recordings in the 50's and 60's for the Specialty and Savoy labels are part of the canon of gospel.         Ms. Edwards, born Odessa Glasgoe in Birmingham, earned a bachelor's degree from Miles College there and a master's degree from the University of Alabama at Birmingham.         She taught high school mathematics and was a guidance counselor at Wenonah High School in Birmingham.         Besides Ms. Riley, of Miami, she is survived by a grandson, David Curry III of Orlando, Fla., and three great-grandchildren.       
         Mildred Jeffrey, who for seven decades was an influential behind-the-scenes combatant in the women's, labor and civil rights movements, died on March 24 in Detroit. She was 93.         Her death was announced by the United Automobile Workers union, where she was the first woman to head a department, becoming director of its Women's Bureau in 1944. She was a founder of the National Women's Political Caucus and was the unofficial head of a group of women who helped persuade Walter F. Mondale to name Geraldine A. Ferraro as his running mate on the 1984 Democratic ticket.         As a student at the University of Minnesota in the early 1930's, she and an African-American classmate helped integrate restaurants in Minneapolis. Decades later, she marched in the South with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.         In 2000, President Bill Clinton awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.         Mildred McWilliams, known as Millie, was born on Dec. 29, 1910, in Alton, Iowa, the eldest of seven children. Her grandmother, a widow, ran a farm and raised 16 children by herself. Her mother, who was the first woman to become a registered pharmacist in Iowa, in 1908, raised seven children on her own after her husband left the family.         In 1932, Ms. Jeffrey received a bachelor's degree in psychology from the University of Minnesota, where she immersed herself in the socialist and progressive movements. In 1934, she received a master's degree in social economy and social research from Bryn Mawr.         With the passage of laws promoting labor unions, she became an organizer for the Amalgamated Clothing Workers in Philadelphia and later the education director of the Pennsylvania Joint Board of Shirt Workers.         In 1936, she married another Amalgamated organizer, Homer Newman Jeffrey. They organized workers in the South and the East, taking mill jobs and rushing to unionize factories before management fired them for their activism. They divorced in the late 1950's.         During World War II, they moved to Washington and became consultants to the War Labor Board. There, they became close to Walter and Victor Reuther, the U.A.W. leaders.         In 1944, she moved to Detroit when the Reuthers offered her the job as head of the union's new Women's Bureau. She organized the U.A.W.'s first women's conference when a flood of returning veterans resulted in the large-scale postwar layoffs of women from factory jobs.         From 1949 to 1954 she ran the union's radio station. She also became director of its community relations department, aligning the union behind many civil rights efforts, and from 1968 to 1976, the year she retired, she headed the union's consumer affairs department.         Throughout her years at the union, she was active organizing, canvassing and raising money for the Democratic Party and civil rights efforts.         After helping create the National Women's Political Caucus in 1971, she became a leader on the Democratic Party committee that ensured that half the delegates to its 1980 convention were women. She helped propel the careers of many women in politics, including the governor of Michigan, Jennifer M. Granholm, a Democrat.         Patricia Schroeder, a former United States representative from Colorado, said, ''Millie is the political godmother for many of us.''         Ms. Jeffrey ran for only one office, when she was elected in Michigan to the board of governors of Wayne State University in Detroit. She served on the board for 16 years, including three years as its chairwoman.         She played a major role in many groups, including the Coalition of Labor Union Women, Emily's List, Americans for Democratic Action, the National Abortion Rights League and the American Civil Liberties Union.         She is survived by a daughter, Sharon Lehrer of San Rafael, Calif.; a son, Balfour, of Missoula, Mont.; three sisters, Arlene Swain of St. Paul, Dorothy Shabel of St. Louis and Marjorie Lapic of Seattle; and two grandchildren.         Three years ago, Ms. Jeffrey told a University of Minnesota magazine: ''My underlying goal was always to empower women. Get them to learn their rights, and to exercise them!''       
         Larisa Bogoraz, an early Soviet-era dissident whose moral stubbornness helped define the movement, died Tuesday at the age of 74. Colleagues said the cause of death was a series of strokes.         Ms. Bogoraz is best remembered for her participation in the first public demonstration of the dissident era, in 1968, when she and six others stood in Red Square in Moscow to protest the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia.         She was quickly arrested and spent four years in internal exile, after which she resumed her activities, in a pattern that would be repeated by many others over the years.         ''I lived like a free person,'' she said in an interview after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. ''Yes, they sent me to jail and exile, but I knew what I was doing was right according to my beliefs.''         She became active in human rights issues after the arrest of her first husband, Yuli Daniel, for anti-Soviet essays written together with his friend Andrei Sinyavsky, in 1965, the same year she received her doctorate in linguistics.         Ms. Bogoraz was a signer of many of the dissidents' main appeals over the years. She was co-author of an underground book, ''Memory,'' which chronicled Stalin's terror, and she was a leading contributor to the underground publication Chronicle of Current Events.         ''She was a moral influence since the beginning and her influence defined the course of this whole movement,'' said Lyuda Alekseyeva, a close friend and contemporary who now heads the Moscow Helsinki Group, a leading human rights organization.         Ms. Bogoraz's second husband, Anatoloy Marchenko, was another prominent dissident, with whom she wrote a number of appeals and who was arrested in 1980.         In 1986, Ms. Bogoraz helped start a campaign to free all political prisoners. But by the time the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, began liberating prisoners in 1987, Mr. Marchenko had died.         In 1989 Ms. Bogoraz joined the reconstituted Moscow Helsinki Group and became a bridge between the older dissident movement and the country's new human rights campaigners.         ''With her death a part of the old tradition is going away,'' said Tanya Lokshina, one of the young leaders of the Helsinki Group.         ''Many people referred to her as a legend of the Soviet dissident movement,'' she said. ''But she was a very alive person, very vibrant, very intelligent, very involved and interested in new ideas and new concepts.''         She is survived by Aleksandr Daniel, a son from her first marriage, who is a historian at the Memorial human rights organization.       
         Winson Hudson, a civil rights campaigner in rural Mississippi who flaunted her contempt for Ku Klux Klan intimidation by wearing a bright red dress the many times she marched up to the courthouse to try to register to vote, died on April 24. She was 87.         Her grandson Kempton Horton said she died at a hospital in Jackson, Miss., that she had fought to desegregate.         In 1963, Mrs. Hudson brought the first suit to desegregate schools in a rural Mississippi county and won the case the next year. In 1965, a black child attended a previously all-white school.         She began trying to register to vote at the Leake County courthouse in 1937 and finally succeeded in 1962, but not before repeatedly having to write out and then explain a lengthy passage from the state Constitution. (White registrants merely had to explain this clause: ''All elections shall be by ballot.'')         In Mrs. Hudson's failed attempt to register in 1961, someone slipped a small card to her. It read: ''The Eyes of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan Are Upon You.''         The next year, she dispensed with yet another abstruse constitutional passage, this time under the eyes of Robert F. Kennedy's Justice Department.         The Voting Rights Act of 1965 outlawed literacy tests and poll taxes. Mrs. Hudson soon signed up 500 new voters.         She became chairwoman of the county chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in 1961 at the urging of her friend Medgar Evers, the N.A.A.C.P. leader who was murdered in 1963. She kept the post for 38 years, fighting and winning battles to stop banks from prejudicial lending practices and bringing phones and paved roads to her poor county.         From inviting civil rights workers to sleep on her floor, to bringing Head Start to the community center she created, Mrs. Hudson achieved much -- but not national fame. Most histories of the civil rights movement do not mention her.         ''Mrs. Hudson was one of the unsung, unheralded heroes of the civil rights movement,'' Vernon E. Jordan Jr., who knew her as director of the Voting Education Project of the Southern Regional Council in the 1960's, said in an interview.         ''Her work represents the essence of what took place,'' he continued. ''There's a lot written about the leaders but not much about the contributions of the Mrs. Hudsons of the world.''         Bob Moses, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee's Mississippi field secretary in the 1960's, talked in an interview about the reign of terror of white supremacists whom he said wanted to eliminate the leadership of the N.A.C.C.P. He called Mrs. Hudson ''a part of that very small network of people who not only survived but actually found ways to struggle.''         He continued, ''It is inconceivable that the movement could have happened the way it did in Mississippi without these people.''         Last year, Mrs. Hudson said in an interview with The Clarion-Ledger in Jackson, Miss., that it had been ''a lonely walk.'' But her fierce, righteous attitude was her armor. This was a woman who wrote her own funeral service.         ''The more they did to us, the meaner we got,'' she said in an interview for John Dittmer's 1994 book, ''Local People: The Struggle for Civil Rights in Mississippi.''         Mrs. Hudson looked the part, not least because she was big. Patricia Derian, who fought for integrated schools in Mississippi as a young mother and was an assistant secretary of state in the Carter administration, said in an interview, ''When she walked in a room, it was a little bit like having a battleship arrive.''         Ms. Derian added, ''When you gave her a hug she was soft, and that was all the soft you got out of her.''         Winson Gates was born in Harmony, in central Mississippi, on Nov. 17, 1916, the 10th of 13 children born to John Wesley Gates and Emma Kirkland, neither of whom ever tried to register to vote.         This family history was reported in the book, ''Mississippi Harmony, Memoirs of a Freedom Fighter'' (Macmillan, 2002), written by Mrs. Hudson and Constance Curry.         Mrs. Hudson was 8 when her mother died, and she and her siblings were raised by her father on a 105-acre farm until the land was seized by a white doctor to whom the family owed money.         A more sinister family memory, mentioned in an oral history by the Southern Regional Council, was her father's mentally ill brother being lynched by a white mob.         In 1936, Winson Gates married Cleo Hudson, whose family owned 500 acres in Harmony, a center of black property owners since Reconstruction. She went to work as a teacher at Harmony School and took on the additional chore of managing the lunchroom. The principal reprimanded her for giving free bread to hungry children.         During periods when her activism made it hard to get a job, she did manual labor. She said she could ''saw as much wood as any man.'' In civil rights work, she said she could do more than a man because a man would be in greater physical danger.         In 1937, Mrs. Hudson and her sister Dovie began a habit of going to the courthouse and trying to register ''for the heck of it,'' she wrote in the book. They conscientiously paid the poll tax, later outlawed, despite not being allowed to vote.         When Northern civil rights activists arrived to join local people in the Freedom Summer of 1964, she let the visitors sleep in her house, even after it was bombed. Her husband told James Chaney, a native of the area who would be killed with Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner that summer, not to go to Philadelphia ''because they'd kill you in Neshoba County.''         Mrs. Hudson is survived by her daughter, Annie Maude Horton, of Carthage, Miss.; her brother, Osly Gates of Portland, Ore.; two grandsons and three great-grandchildren.         Her legacy is also marked by Hudson Road, which runs near her house. In 1976, she mobilized the newly powerful black vote to at last pave the streets of Harmony. Before that, paving stopped at the town line.         Correction:  May 12, 2004, Wednesday  An obituary on Sunday about Winson Hudson, a pioneer of the civil rights movement in Mississippi, misstated the year in some copies for the killing of the rights worker James Chaney, who had been warned by her husband against going to Philadelphia, Miss. It was 1964, not 1963.       
         Sarah Betsy Fuller, an advocate for prisoners' rights who also helped law students prepare real cases, died on April 21 in Ithaca, N.Y. She was 58.         The cause was breast cancer, her husband, Ronald, said. She lived in Brooktondale, N.Y.         Ms. Fuller was a lawyer for Prisoners' Legal Services of New York, a state-financed group based in Ithaca that was started after the Attica uprising in 1971 to defend inmates' civil rights.         In 1995, she filed a suit to stop correction officers from videotaping the strip searches of female inmates at Albion Correctional Facility. The state Department of Correctional Services agreed to pay 85 women $1,000 each but said that the settlement did not constitute an admission of wrongdoing.         Ms. Fuller also filed a suit that resulted in the state's signing an agreement in July 1999 to allow American Indians in New York to practice their religion in prison. At the time of her death, she was pursuing state and federal cases seeking to keep prisons from giving some prisoners only bread and water to eat.         Ms. Fuller also held teaching positions at Cornell and Syracuse Universities. She ran clinics in which students could handle cases, usually for indigent clients.         Sarah Betsy Cohen was born on Feb. 26, 1946, in Silver Spring, Md. She graduated from Cornell in 1968 and later earned a master's degree in sociology at the University of Wisconsin and a law degree from Stanford University.         She worked in the civil rights division of the federal Department of Justice from 1974 to 1977. She then moved to Arizona to provide legal services for Navajo and Hopi Indians.         She began teaching at Cornell in 1978 and continued until the mid-1990's.         At Syracuse, Ms. Fuller marshaled her students to pursue cases she had filed for Prisoners' Legal Services. In 2000, she went to El Salvador as a Fulbright scholar to help develop a clinical legal program for the Technical University of El Salvador.         She wrote two books on landmark Supreme Court cases in a series for teenage readers.         In addition to her husband, Ms. Fuller is survived by her sons, Jonah and Gabriel; her daughter, Cecily; and one granddaughter. All live in Ithaca.       
         Anne Gorsuch Burford, a Colorado conservative who was chosen by President Ronald Reagan as his top environmental regulator only to resign under Congressional fire 22 months later, died Sunday in Aurora, Colo. She was 62.         The cause was cancer, her daughter, Stephanie Gorsuch of Denver, said.         In appointing her administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, President Reagan made Ms. Burford a leader in his effort to bring economic discipline to environmental cleanup and to give the states greater enforcement powers on matters like clean air and water, policies she had earlier advocated on the state level. Critics contended that the policies weakened federal environmental enforcement to please polluting industries.         This fundamental difference in perspective reached a climax in a battle between a subcommittee of the House of Representatives, which demanded thousands of pages of documents relating to toxic waste cleanup, and Ms. Burford, who refused to hand them over. She said she would go to jail rather than surrender them to Congress.         Eventually, the White House gave up its claim of executive privilege to keep the documents secret, and Ms. Burford resigned on March 9, 1983.         In her tenure as the second-ranking woman in the Reagan administration, after the United Nations Ambassador Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, Ms. Burford showed sharp intelligence, as well as a taste for confrontation with environmental groups.         Environmentalists like Gaylord Nelson, chairman of the Wilderness Society, accused her of ''a wholesale dismantling'' of environmental advances, but Ms. Burford insisted that she was bringing cost-effective market forces to the regulation of pollution.         Anne Irene McGill was born on April 21, 1942, in Casper, Wyo. Her father, a surgeon, moved the family to Denver when she was an infant.         She earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Colorado in two years and finished law school there at 20, then became the youngest woman admitted to the Colorado bar. She used a Fulbright scholarship to study criminal law in India.         She worked for a bank and then as an assistant district attorney for Jefferson County, Colo., and as deputy district attorney for the City of Denver. After working at two state regulatory agencies, she became a lawyer for Mountain Bell Telephone.         In 1976, she was elected to the first of two terms in the Colorado House of Representatives, where she was a member of a group that called itself the Crazies for its members' passionate devotion to states' rights and opposition to federal energy and environmental policies. She was named outstanding freshman legislator and worked on legislation concerning hazardous wastes and vehicle emissions.         In 1964, she married David Gorsuch, whom she divorced in 1982. The next year, she married Robert Burford, a rancher who was then head of the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management. He died in 1993, while divorce proceedings were in progress. Ms. Burford returned to private law practice after her resignation.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by her sons, J.J. Gorsuch of Denver and Neil Gorsuch of Vienna, Va.; her mother, Dorothy McGill of Denver; her sisters, Mary Edwards of Severna Park, Md., Theresa Peace of Lincoln, Neb., Dorothy McGill of El Paso, Tex., Veronica Urban of Santa Cruz, Calif., and Rosie Binger of Littleton, Colo.; a brother, Joe McGill of Plano, Tex.; and four grandchildren.         James Watt, who became Mr. Reagan's interior secretary, and James Coors, the Colorado brewing and energy magnate, sponsored Ms. Burford for the E.P.A. post. Her confirmation was held up for months as senators debated her qualifications and questioned her agenda, but the outcome was never in serious doubt.         When her nomination hearing was finally held on May 1, 1981, she began by speaking lyrically of her own environment.         ''As a long-term Coloradan,'' she said, ''I come before you with a deep appreciation of the unique beauties which we enjoy in our environment -- the majesty and grandeur of the Rocky Mountains, the openness and sense of space of our eastern plains.''       
         Hildy Parks Cohen, the producer, writer and actress known as Hildy Parks who wrote the first 20 Tony Awards telecasts as well as 20 other television specials, including the Emmy Awards, died on Thursday at the Actors Fund Home in Englewood, N.J. She was 78.         The cause was complications of a recent stroke, said her son Christopher Cohen.         Ms. Parks was a partner with her husband, Alexander H. Cohen, one of the last old-time independent theatrical producers, with 101 Broadway and West End shows to his name. He died in 2000. Together, from 1967 to 1986, Mr. Cohen usually produced the Tonys, and Ms. Parks wrote them.         As a result of the couple's ministrations, the Tony shows were frequently held up as a model of what other award shows, like the Oscars, ought to be: fast-paced, lively and topical.         Mr. Cohen said his mother ''was the intellect, and Dad was the bravado'' in their Tony work. Political events always made their way into the presentations. Ms. Parks's own views were very much those of a liberal Democrat, and she went so far as to give up limousines for bicycles, cheerfully waving to her husband as he went by in his big black car.         Ms. Parks won two Emmy Awards: one in 1980 for producing the 34th annual Tony Awards and one for producing ''The Night of 100 Stars'' in 1982.         In a 1982 article in The New York Times, Carol Lawson described how Ms. Parks worked hard behind the scenes at the Tony Awards:         ''As the one who warms up the live audience with good-natured barbs at the theater industry before airtime, Mr. Cohen is the more visible member of the team; but it is Miss Parks who puts the whole thing together.'' Ms. Parks was both shrewd and down to earth, focusing on getting the awards show picked up by television by signing on names familiar to television viewers. She did all the research for the show herself at the Lincoln Center library.         She also wrote the 37th and 38th annual Emmy Awards; ''Plácido Domingo: Steppin' Out With the Ladies'' on ABC in 1985; and NBC's 60th anniversary show in 1986.         Besides her contributions to causes like housing for the homeless, Greenpeace, the Actors' Fund and animal rights (she often brought home animals that appeared in shows to become family pets), she was involved with Community Board 5 in Midtown Manhattan and was prominent in continuing efforts to acquire landmark status for all the Broadway theaters.         Hildy Parks was born in Washington on March 12, 1926. She graduated from the University of Virginia and soon after went to New York to make her stage debut as Curley's wife in ''Of Mice and Men'' at the New School. She made her Broadway debut in 1947, when she appeared in ''Bathsheba'' with James Mason. In 1948 she played the Girl in Tennessee Williams's ''Summer and Smoke'' and was the only woman in the London cast of ''Mr. Roberts.''         After a brief marriage to Jackie Cooper, Ms. Parks met Mr. Cohen in 1953 while playing Gwendolyn Holly in the comedy ''Be Your Age'' at the 48th Street Theater. He was one of the play's producers. The play lasted only three days, but the marriage endured for 44 years.         Ms. Parks's involvement with theater also lasted for many years. In the 1983-84 season she worked as a producer or co-producer on the plays ''Edmund Kean,'' ''La Tragédie de Carmen'' and ''Play Memory.'' In 1984 she and her husband co-produced Dario Fo's play ''Accidental Death of an Anarchist.''         Ms. Parks also acted in films, like ''Fail Safe'' in 1964 and ''The Group'' in 1966, and made regular appearances on major television shows for 12 years. They ranged from ''Philco Playhouse'' and ''Studio One'' to ''To Tell the Truth,'' on which she was a frequent panelist. From 1951 to 1955, she played the character Ellie Crown in the daytime series ''Love of Life.''         In addition to Christopher Cohen, Ms. Parks is survived by her son Gerald Cohen and a stepdaughter, Barbara Cohen Hoffman.
