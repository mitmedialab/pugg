         Lucy Freeman, a reporter and an author whose early coverage of psychiatry and mental health for The New York Times led to wider reporting on the subject, died on Wednesday at the Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale, in the Bronx. She was 88.         The cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease, said her nephew David L. Schroedel.         Ms. Freeman, one of the few women on the Times's reporting staff when she was hired in 1940, initially wrote light society features, but moved to breaking news with an award-winning story on the explosion of two ships hauling munitions in Galveston Bay, Tex., in 1947.         By the late 1940's, some time after she began undergoing her own psychoanalysis, she persuaded editors to allow coverage of the growth of psychiatry and the preservation of Sigmund Freud's private papers.         ''It was even more unusual because it was in an era in which psychology was not popular,'' said Nan Robertson, the author of ''The Girls in the Balcony: Women, Men and The New York Times.'' ''It used to be that people poked fun at getting shrunk.''         Over the course of four years, she reported on welfare, the stigma of mental illness and advancements in treatments for schizophrenic patients. She also studied mental health and welfare programs in the city hospital system.         Her nonfiction books, ranging from detailed studies of Freud to those exploring sources of anger and anxiety, helped familiarize a popular audience with what had long been a hush-hush practice.         Ms. Freeman's first book, ''Fight Against Fears,'' recounted her own experience as a psychoanalysis patient who struggled to overcome her shy, whispery voice and social fears. Published in 1951, the book was in print for 47 years.         Ms. Freeman also wrote 77 other books, including mystery novels and memoirs.         The first of four children born to a prominent New York family, Ms. Freeman was a member of the first graduating class at Bennington College in Vermont.         She was hired by The New York Times in 1940 and would later describe the newsroom of the day as ''a sea of male reporters.''         ''I hardly dared savor the glory. All those men,'' she wrote in a memoir, ''The Beloved Prison,'' (St. Martin's Press, 1989). ''I also dared the fleeting thought that among all these masculine forms perhaps I would find a husband.''         She eventually married William M. Freeman, an editor who had fixed an error in a story she filed from Texas. The marriage lasted two years.         Fond of low-cut dresses and high-heeled shoes, Ms. Freeman relished the attention she received from her male colleagues on the city desk, Ms. Robertson said. Mary Yost, Ms. Freeman's agent for more than 15 years, said that she digested academic papers like a scholar, but always preferred to write for a larger audience.         She could at times ''appear to be an ingénue, an innocent,'' Ms. Yost said, but she also played a mean game of poker, loved throwing large parties at her apartment with a view of Central Park, and mixed as easily with jockeys as she did with actors and intellectuals.         ''She enjoyed a popular audience for her work, and she wanted it in her social life, too,'' Ms. Yost said.         Ms. Freeman is survived by her brother, Edward Greenbaum of Clearwater, Fla; her sister, Sue Polera of Las Vegas; her sister and brother-in-law, Sally and Warren Rosenberg of Scarborough, N.Y.; and numerous nieces and nephews.       
         Miriam Rothschild, the heiress who discovered how fleas jump, brought Chaucerian wildflowers back to modern England and was acknowledged as one of the world's most distinguished naturalists, died Thursday at her home, Ashton Wold, in Northamptonshire. She was 96.         Her death was announced by her family.         Her extensive scientific and conservation achievements were matched by the might of her will and her delectably eccentric personality.         ''Imagine Beatrix Potter on amphetamines,'' The Times of London once said of her.         Though she viewed herself as a naturalist, more of a describer than an experimenter, she was taken seriously as a scientist and often worked with distinguished colleagues. Her well-known work on butterflies making themselves toxic by means of their food choices was done with the chemist Tadeus Reichstein, a Nobel Prize winner. Her highly original observations helped confirm 19th-century theories of evolution that had awaited 20th-century chemistry.         Given the title of dame by the queen in 1999 for her scientific achievements, she was more than a scientist, not least because she never had to fill out a grant application.         Was it odd that a scion of the venerable Rothschild clan should become the world's leading expert on fleas? Hardly. Dame Miriam's father was the banker Nathaniel Charles Rothschild, who found more than 500 new species of fleas. His daughter's six-volume catalog of his collection of 30,000 specimens, which she completed in 20 years beginning in 1953, firmly established her as the flea authority other experts consulted.         Her uncle Lionel Walter Rothschild's collections were just as inspirational. He amassed 2.3 million butterflies, 300,000 bird skins, 144 giant tortoises and 300,000 birds' eggs, among other things..         From her earliest youth, Dame Miriam loved animals and plants. Her mind was free to roam, and she received no formal education until she was 17, when she demanded to go to school. She never earned any degree, but received an honorary doctorate from Oxford in 1968.         Ranging from marine biology to chemistry to pharmacology to neurophysiology to horticulture to zoology, she came up with novel, often startling conclusions.         Her research on insects eating substances that are poisonous to their predators was considered groundbreaking. After determining that butterflies' bright colors were warning signals of their toxicity, she found that other species evolved to mimic the danger-sign coloration. She found that odors emitted by toxic butterflies were mimicked by other species, vindicating 19th-century naturalists' speculations.         Her enthusiasm for wildflowers led to her advising Prince Charles on plantings for his estate and Lady Bird Johnson on her program to beautify American roadsides.         Her interests ranged far beyond science. During World War II she tenaciously pressed the British authorities to admit more Jews from Nazi Germany and at one point personally housed 49 Jewish children. She worked in the top-secret British effort at Bletchley Park to crack the Nazis' code.         She fought for cause upon cause, including better treatment for laboratory animals, rights for homosexuals and free milk for schoolchildren.         Her farm at the family estate of Ashton Wold, near Peterborough, was a passion and her main source of income. Her livestock and plants won awards.         She did it all with a zestfully personal sense of style, wearing the loose-fitting clothes she designed for herself 50 years ago as she walked the grounds with her half-dozen pet Shetland sheepdogs.         Miriam Louisa Rothschild was born on Aug. 5, 1908, at Ashton Wold, where she lived her entire life. Her mother, Rozika de Wertheimstein, was a top Hungarian sportswoman, and Dame Miriam herself played tennis, cricket and squash, the last in international competitions.         Her childhood, as described in a 1987 New Yorker profile by Kennedy Fraser, was ''like a fairy tale: the palatial houses stuffed with mysteries and treasures; the grandfather who liked to shower gold half-sovereigns from his carriage; the brilliant dotty uncle with his cassowaries and his white top hat.''         Her first love was nature. By the age of 4 she was collecting ladybugs and caterpillars and taking a tame quail to bed with her.         Her world darkened when she was 15 and her father committed suicide. She temporarily lost interest in his passion, the natural world. But a year or two later, her enthusiasm was rekindled when she helped her brother dissect a frog.         ''I had never before seen fresh, internal organs, blood vessels and nerves,'' she wrote in an essay in Scientific American. Calling the experience ''my road to Damascus,'' she wrote, ''Their extreme beauty was a revelation.''         After taking some courses at the University of London, she worked in Naples and England studying a kind of mollusk.         ''During the first day of dissecting the bivalve,'' she wrote in Scientific American, ''I found a specimen infested with larval trematodes,'' which are parasitic flatworms known as flukes. ''It proved to be a hitherto undescribed species and a most extraordinary one from every point of view. My fate was sealed. I was completely hooked.''         She worked 16-hour days studying trematodes until a German bomb destroyed all traces of seven years of her research.         With the war, she passed a test to be an air warden but was first assigned to work as a dairymaid. She was secretly summoned to work on the top-secret Enigma code-breaking project and labored 12 hours a day for several years with Alan Turing.         In 1943 she married George Lane, a handsome Hungarian-born British commando. They had four children and adopted two more before divorcing in 1957. She is survived by one of her sons and three of her daughters.         As she raised her children, her late-night attention turned to fleas. She began writing about them in clear, engaging prose.         In ''Fleas, Flukes & Cuckoos: A Study of Bird Parasites,'' which she wrote with Theresa Clay in 1952 (Philosophical Library), she argued that most people misunderstood fleas.         ''It is difficult for them to realize that fleas breathe through holes in their sides, have a nerve cord below their stomachs and a heart in their backs; or that certain arthropods lay eggs through their heads and regularly practice virgin birth.''         Using high-speed photography, she studied how fleas jump. She theorized that they descended from winged ancestors and employed modified flight structures. In a famous comparison, she said fleas jump as high for fleas as the Empire State Building would be for humans.         Turning to plants as well as animals, she became one of the first practitioners of the new interdisciplinary approach to biological studies called ecology.         She began designing gardens to attract butterflies, writing extensively on the subject.         ''You can really abandon any romantic idea of creating a home for these angelic creatures,'' she wrote in ''The Butterfly Gardener,'' published in 1983. ''The best you can do is provide them with a good pub.'' She owned a pub for humans, in Ashton, decorated with natural history exhibits.         In 1970 she began to collect, propagate and sell wildflower seeds.         ''In the early 1980's, I went to a lecture given by a distinguished zoologist who said we should preserve our medieval hayfields, because it would take a thousand years to grow one from scratch,'' she said. ''After the lecture I told him I had done a good imitation in 10. From that moment, I thought I should spread the gospel.''         Spread it she did, to Mrs. Johnson and Prince Charles. As a result of the movement she led, British agriculture policies that favored replacing natural meadows with rye grass were reversed.         She remained as down to earth as the stone ruin her own house became as she deliberately let an immense tangle of ivy, wisteria, clematis and roses envelop it.       
         Andre Norton, a prolific and popular science-fiction and fantasy writer whose central theme was the rite of passage to self-realization undertaken by misfits or displaced outsiders, died yesterday at her home in Murfreesboro, Tenn. She was 93.         The cause was congestive heart failure, Sue Stewart, her friend and caretaker, said.         In more than 130 novels, nearly 100 short stories and numerous anthologies that Ms. Norton edited in the science-fiction, fantasy, mystery and western genres, the theme of alienation and return keeps recurring.         In a typical story, ''Star Man's Son, 2250 A.D.'' (Harcourt, 1952) -- her first science-fiction novel -- Fors, a mutant rejected by a postwar society because of his differences, goes in search of a lost city rumored to be free of radiation. Accompanied by a cat with which he communicates telepathically, Fors discovers his own worth through a string of difficult tests.         ''Star Man's Son'' was the relatively late start of Ms. Norton's science fiction career; until then, she had mainly been a novelist writing juvenile historical fiction and adventure stories, under the pen name Andre Norton, chosen because her readers were thought to be exclusively boys         At the time, the market for science-fiction was largely confined to magazines, but with the growth of the genre in book form after 1950, Ms. Norton took the field by storm. Donald A. Wollheim, editor of the paperback house Ace Books, saw her potential in an adult market, acquired the rights to ''Starman's Son,'' published it under the title ''Daybreak -- 2250 A.D.,'' eliminating all references to the story and its author as being for young readers, and found himself with a steady seller.         Although Ms. Norton's subsequent books for Ace sold in the hundreds of thousands, she found herself the victim of a Catch-22: critics of science fiction did not take her seriously because she was considered a juvenile writer and critics of children's literature dismissed her because she wrote science fiction.         Her legions of readers remained loyal, however, and critics eventually came to take her seriously. She was the first woman to win the Gandalf Grand Master of Fantasy award and the Nebula Grand Master Award for lifetime achievement from the Science Fiction Writers of America.         Her work was praised for its unobtrusive depth and complexity. As Francis J. Molson wrote in the Dictionary of Literary Biography, ''It is possible that the pace and suspense of Norton's storytelling may so ensnare readers that they may overlook the themes and concerns her narratives embody.''         Foremost among those themes, many of her readers have said, was her insistence that personal fulfillment required accepting the individual's contradictions, whether they were sexual, racial or otherwise. For instance, the villains in her most popular series, ''Witch World,'' comprising about 30 volumes, are the females who think falsely that they have to remain virginal to retain their power.         In the same vein, Ms. Norton deplored people's embrace of technology.         ''I think the human race made a bad mistake at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution,'' she told Charles Platt in an interview for his ''Dream Makers Volume II: The Uncommon Men and Women Who Write Science Fiction'' (1983). ''We leaped for the mechanical things.''         She added, ''People need the use of their hands to feel creative.''         Alice Mary Norton, who changed her name legally to Andre Norton in 1934, was born on Feb. 17, 1912, in Cleveland, Ohio, the younger of two daughters of Adalbert Freely Norton, a rug salesman, and Bertha Stemm Norton. At Collingwood High School she wrote for the school newspaper and during her senior year produced her first novel, which, reworked, became her second published book, ''Ralestone Luck'' (Appleton, 1938).         Intending to become a history teacher, she attended Western Reserve University (now Case Western Reserve) but was forced to drop out in her freshman year because of the Depression. Taking a job at the Cleveland Public Library, she was assigned to the children's book section, allowing her to become expert in the literature. Though already interested in science fiction, she turned to writing history for young adults, publishing her first novel, ''The Prince Commands'' (Appleton, 1934), at 22.         Continuing to publish adventure novels, she stayed at the library until 1950, working in 38 of its 40 branches. In 1941, she interrupted that stint to work at the Library of Congress and to own a bookstore in Maryland. In 1950, she took a job as a reader at Gnome Press, the science-fiction publisher, and continued to write on the side. By the time she left, in 1958, to become a full-time writer, she had published 23 novels and several short stories. In the next two decades she wrote almost 70 novels and two dozen short stories, and edited several anthologies. She also collaborated with many writers.         In 1966, she moved to Florida and later to Murfreesboro, where in 1999 she founded High Hallack, a retreat and research library for writers that she closed in 2004.       
         Dale Messick, a pioneering newspaper cartoonist who fought her way to the top of a man's profession by creating Brenda Starr, the glamorous red-haired journalist who fought her way to the top of a man's profession, died on Tuesday in Sonoma County, Calif. She was 98.         She died after a long decline that began with a stroke in 1998, her daughter, Starr Rohrman, told The Associated Press. She had been caring for her mother at her home in Penngrove, Calif.         Ms. Messick was born on April 11, 1906; Brenda Starr was born in June 1940. An impossibly glamorous redhead, her appearance was inspired by Rita Hayworth; her first name came from the most famous debutante of the day, Brenda Frazier, and her last name was chosen because she was the star reporter on The Flash.         The Brenda Starr comic strip was a symphony of décolletage, good legs precariously balanced on high-heeled shoes, and Dior-like clothing that no woman would be likely to wear to a newspaper office.         During the war she was an ace reporter, chasing spies and other malefactors in cities and in jungles, fighting off sharks, giant squids and other ravenous animals, but selling war bonds, too. Her red hair was always attractively coiffed; her eyes always glistened with tiny starbursts.         She found time for romance with her mystery man, Basil St. John, a lean, square-jawed hunk who wore an eye patch and whose only other defect was that he was dying of an exotic disease. This frequently sent him to the jungle in search of a rare black orchid whose serum gave him temporary respite. While he was away, Brenda had more suitors than Penelope, but she remained loyal to her true love. Brenda finally married Basil in 1976, whereupon he vanished again on another orchid hunt.         As for Ms. Messick, she was married twice, to Everett George and Oscar Strom, and both marriages ended in divorce. She is survived by her daughter, from her first marriage, and two grandchildren.         Of her heroine's profession, she once explained, ''She was already a reporter when the strip started, but she was sick and tired of covering nothing but ice-cream socials. She wanted a job with action, like the men reporters had.''         But Ms. Messick knew little about the newspaper business and refused to learn about it, saying it might spoil her imagination.         ''Brenda Starr, Reporter'' was sometimes criticized by journalists for its outlandish depiction of their profession. In one strip, Brenda brings a typed story to The Flash late at night and hands it to a custodian, who somehow gets it into the next day's paper. On another occasion, she finds herself in an airplane she cannot fly, so she parachutes to safety, somehow landing in front of her editor's window.         And, in perhaps the greatest breach of authenticity, she talks back to her managing editor.         Ms. Messick hired other people to draw cars and other mechanical contraptions, animals and nature scenes. But for four decades, only she drew Brenda Starr's face and body.         Dalia Messick, born in South Bend, Ind., spent two years in the third grade and two years in the eighth grade and did not get her high school diploma until she was 20, and then only at the urging of her parents, Cephas Messick, a sign painter and vocational arts teacher, and Bertha Messick, a milliner; her work inspired some of Brenda's fetching hats.         Ms. Messick changed her name to Dale after she encountered discrimination against women entering the newspaper cartooning business. She told Norma Lee Browning of The Saturday Evening Post: ''Brenda is the glamorous girl I wished I was. ... She's what most women wish they were and what most men wish their women were, too.''         She originally thought of her character as a girl bandit, but was talked into making her a reporter by an aide to Joseph Medill Patterson, founder and publisher of The Daily News of New York and head of The Chicago Tribune-New York News Syndicate.         Ms. Messick had started drawing comic strips in school. After leaving school, she studied art for a summer in Chicago and worked for greeting card companies there and in New York, continuing to work on her comic strips at night. None were published until ''Brenda Starr'' was accepted by the syndicate.         After Brenda Starr appeared, Ms. Messick dyed her hair red to match Brenda's. ''I am Brenda Starr,'' she would say to interviewers.         ''Brenda Starr'' was twice adapted for the screen, first as a 1945 serial with Joan Woodbury, and later as a feature movie starring Brooke Shields. Shot in 1986, it was not released until 1992, when it opened to dismal notices. Ms. Messick warned everyone she met not to see it.         However, over the years, there were Brenda Starr dolls and even a postage stamp with Brenda's likeness on it, part of a series on 20 classic comic characters.         At its height, ''Brenda Starr'' appeared in 250 papers and is still syndicated by Tribune Media Services. Ms. Messick retired from drawing the strip in the mid-1980's, and it was passed on to other artists, all women. She said she did not like the way later versions of Brenda Starr looked.         In the 1990's, she developed a new comic character called ''Granny Glamour,'' who appeared in a single-panel cartoon in a publication for the elderly in California.         In her 80's, she boasted of juggling three boyfriends simultaneously.         ''All three wouldn't make one good man,'' she told an interviewer, ''but at my age, you can't be too choosy.''       
         Geraldine Stutz, who transformed Henri Bendel from a carriage trade retailer in decline into a chic emporium of designer brands in the 1960's, died yesterday at her home in New York. She was 80.         Her death came after a long illness, said her stepdaughter, Emma Turner.         Ms. Stutz is best known for her 29-year career as the president of Henri Bendel, with a legendary eye for discovering the newest designers and using them first, installing their collections in elaborately merchandised departments that heralded the introduction of a new generation of fashion stars -- Stephen Burrows, Perry Ellis, Jean Muir, Sonia Rykiel, Carlos Falchi, Mary McFadden, Holly Harp and Ralph Lauren among them.         Many longtime Bendel shoppers recall Ms. Stutz's 1958 overhaul of the main floor at the store, at 10 West 57th Street, into a U-shaped ''Street of Shops'' widely acknowledged as a precursor to modern shop-in-shop merchandising displays. Based on her taste alone, Ms. Stutz divided merchandise into small vitrines of watches, handbags, stockings, and along one side, an inspiring ''Gilded Cage,'' a giant replica of a birdcage that housed the cosmetics department.         ''Geraldine had a vision of the kind of store she wanted to create,'' said Jean Rosenberg, who was the vice president and merchandising director at Bendel's from six months before Ms. Stutz's arrival in 1957 to their joint departure in 1986, after the store was sold to The Limited. ''It was for a particular kind of New York woman, where she could find a uniformity of taste and a certain amount of comfort in a smallish environment, where everything in one store was to her liking.''         Ms. Stutz was born in Chicago on Aug. 5, 1924. She aspired to an acting career and studied drama at Mundelein College before changing her focus to journalism. She moved to New York to be closer to the theater and found work as a fashion editor for movie magazines, and in 1947 was hired as an associate fashion editor for Glamour magazine, where she covered shoes.         Colleagues described Ms. Stutz as an industrious learner who immersed herself in the subject matter. Grace Mirabella, the former editor of Mirabella magazine, recalled an introduction to Ms. Stutz in the early 1950's, when Ms. Mirabella was working at Vogue. ''She loved to talk about the business and what was going on behind the scenes, and she knew everything about shoes,'' Ms. Mirabella said.         Ms. Stutz put her knowledge to practical use when she went to work for several footwear manufacturers, including I. Miller, the company for which Andy Warhol designed advertisements, after it was sold to the conglomerate Genesco. Maxey Jarman, its president, recognized in Ms. Stutz an ability for merchandising and advertising, and named her to run the Henri Bendel store in 1957. ''Jarman had talked to her at great length about her vision for the store,'' Ms. Rosenberg said. ''It was not going to be a store for everybody.''         Bendel's was known at various times as a hat shop and as the source of the Duke of Windsor's wardrobe, but Ms. Stutz's concept was narrowly focused on a young, sophisticated urban woman, and she rarely ordered clothes larger than size 10. In an article in New York magazine in 1987, Ms. Stutz described her taste for what she called ''dog whistle'' fashion: ''clothes with a pitch so high and special that only the thinnest and most sophisticated women would hear their call.'' She was also one of the first retailers to consider merchandising food and furniture alongside fashion, and she made way for the in-store designer boutique in the late 1960's, as she did for Ms. Rykiel.         ''She recognized that fashion was more than just about clothing; it was about lifestyle and how one lives,'' said Joan Kaner, the fashion director of Neiman Marcus, who worked under Ms. Stutz from 1967 to 1976. ''She thought to put in perfumed candles and potpourri at the entrances so that when people walked in, they got this wonderful aroma. She was born with impeccable taste, and practically brought over every European designer who ever came to America.''         Ms. Stutz's Street of Shops replaced what was formerly a dimly lit floor with merchandise randomly displayed along a 100-foot corridor. She installed marble floors and boutiques, small shops within the larger store that changed each season, stocked with exclusive merchandise culled from markets around the world -- a flower shop, stationery, a tiny art gallery, tabletop items from Frank MacIntosh, Lee Bailey's home displays, and a boutique called ''Port of Call'' with objects from Vietnam and Thailand.         Ms. Rosenberg recalled her instructions to travel to Paris to explore the new market for ready-to-wear in 1959, when Ms. Stutz told her, ''Buy anything you want.''         ''It was a store that was edited like a magazine,'' Ms. Mirabella said. ''It was everybody's meeting place on Saturdays or at Christmastime.''         Ms. Stutz took the in-store-shop concept further in the late 1960's with boutiques dedicated to the collections of designers she felt could succeed with the store's support. Stephen Burrows opened his boutique there in 1969, an experience he recalled as a defining moment of his career (one he replicated in 2002 at Bendel's current site: 712 Fifth Avenue).         In 1980, Ms. Stutz assembled a team of investors and acquired the store from Genesco. Five years later she sold her interest, and worked as a publisher with Random House, overseeing books on Andy Warhol and Elsie de Wolfe. She also continued to consult with designers and retailers through a practice called GSG Group, which she founded in 1993.         Ms. Stutz's mid-1960's marriage to David Gibbs, an art dealer and painter, ended in divorce, her stepdaughter, Ms. Turner, said.         Robert Rufino, the vice president of creative services at Tiffany & Co., is one of the many retail executives who found their start with Ms. Stutz. He designed windows for the company in the 1970's, and recalled Ms. Stutz's ability to intermingle her interests in art and film with fashion.         ''In those days, there was nothing else like Henri Bendel,'' Mr. Rufino said. ''It was like working for the best house in the world. To take this little town house and make it look like someone lived there, as you were going from room to room -- it was just one woman's vision on the world of fashion, and yet it did incredibly well.''       
         Betty Talmadge, a former first lady of Georgia and a prominent Washington hostess who had a second career as a businesswoman, restaurateur and cookbook author after her divorce from Senator Herman E. Talmadge, died on Saturday in Atlanta. She was 81.         Mrs. Talmadge died after a long illness, her son, Gene, said.         Mrs. Talmadge was married to Mr. Talmadge, a Democrat and the scion of a powerful Georgia political family, from 1941 until their divorce in 1977. A former Georgia governor who served four terms in the United States Senate, from 1957 to 1981, Mr. Talmadge died in 2002.         In 1979, Mrs. Talmadge testified before the Senate Select Committee on Ethics against her former husband, who was accused of improperly using campaign and office money.         As Georgia's first lady in the 1940's and 50's, Mrs. Talmadge was known for her lavish parties filled with antebellum charm. At the Talmadge family plantation in Lovejoy, Ga., 25 miles south of Atlanta, partygoers might be greeted by soldiers dressed in Confederate gray, Dixieland banjo players and the family pets, among them Rabbit E. Lee and a donkey named Assley Wilkes. In the 1960's and 70's, Mrs. Talmadge was a frequent bridge partner of Lady Bird Johnson.         She also ran a prosperous country ham business and in later years operated a restaurant out of her home. She wrote two cookbooks, ''How to Cook a Pig & Other Back-to-the-Farm Recipes'' (Simon & Schuster, 1977), with Jean Robitscher and Carolyn Carter; and ''Betty Talmadge's Lovejoy Plantation Cookbook'' (Peachtree Publishers, 1983).         Leila Elizabeth Shingler was born in Ashburn, Ga., on Sept. 17, 1923, and married Mr. Talmadge at 18. In 1947, at 24, she became Georgia's first lady for 67 days after Mr. Talmadge briefly succeeded his father, Gov. Eugene Talmadge, who had died after being re-elected but before being sworn in. Herman Talmadge was later officially appointed to fill out his father's term through 1948, when he won a special election; he went on to win a full four-year term as governor in 1950.         In the early 1950's, Mrs. Talmadge and her husband started Talmadge Farms, which cured hams. She built the company into a $6 million business before selling it in 1969.         At the end of 1976, Mrs. Talmadge learned from a television news report that her husband had filed for divorce.         In 1978, she ran in the Democratic primary for the House seat in Georgia's Sixth District. She lost the primary; Newt Gingrich, a Republican, won the general election.         In the summer of 1979, Mrs. Talmadge, who said she was testifying reluctantly, told the Senate Ethics Committee about tens of thousands of dollars in cash that her former husband kept in an overcoat in the closet of their Washington condominium. Although Mrs. Talmadge did not specify how the cash got into the coat, she testified that she and her husband had dipped into it for years whenever they needed extra money. She said she used the cash to supplement the $50 weekly allowance from her millionaire husband.         In October, the Senate voted to denounce Senator Talmadge for ''reprehensible'' official finances. He lost his bid for a fifth term in 1980.         Besides her son, of Lovejoy, Mrs. Talmadge is survived by eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Another son, Robert, died in 1975.         After her first cookbook appeared, The New York Times asked Mrs. Talmadge how she had found the nerve to slaughter her first pig.         ''Real easy, honey,'' she replied. ''I just thought, 'You little male chauvinist, you,' and I went to it.''       
         Ruth Laredo, a pianist equally at home in chamber music and solo works who was known for landmark recordings of Scriabin and Rachmaninoff, died on Wednesday at her apartment in New York. She was 67.         Ms. Laredo, who played her last concert on May 6 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, had cancer and died in her sleep, said her manager, James Murtha.         The concert was one of a series she had given for 17 years at the Met called ''Concerts With Commentary,'' in which Ms. Laredo played and spoke engagingly about music. The series had become an important part of the New York concert scene, where she was a frequent presence.         Just two days after the attack on the World Trade Center, Ms. Laredo celebrated the 25th anniversary of her Alice Tully Hall debut with a recital there. It was the opening concert of the 2001 Lincoln Center season, and Ms. Laredo addressed the audience beforehand, saying: ''It was important for me to play. Great music gives us spiritual sustenance and gives us hope. It is in that spirit that I play tonight.''         Ms. Laredo was a pianist in the Romantic mold, a dynamic performer concerned with texture and color. In recent years, Mr. Murtha said, her career as a soloist with orchestras had waned, but she was comfortable with a mix of recitals, chamber concerts and accompanying duties.         When she was first on the rise, in the 1970's, Ms. Laredo was a relative rarity as a female piano soloist, particularly in the technically demanding and muscular works of Rachmaninoff. There were only a few others -- Gina Bachauer, Myra Hess and later Alicia de Larrocha, for example.         ''Every time we did interviews in those early days, she was asked how does it feel to be a woman pianist,'' Mr. Murtha said. ''She wanted to be a pianist, period.''         Ruth Meckler was born in Detroit on Nov. 20, 1937. She attended the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where she studied with Rudolf Serkin. She graduated in 1960 and that same year married the violinist Jaime Laredo, with whom she collaborated musically. They later divorced. Ms. Laredo is survived by their daughter, Jennifer Laredo, who lives in London with her husband, the cellist Paul Watkins, and by a granddaughter.         Ms. Laredo made her debut with an orchestra in 1962, in a program led by Leopold Stokowski conducting the American Symphony Orchestra at Carnegie Hall. She made her debut with the New York Philharmonic, conducted by Pierre Boulez, 12 years later. Her Carnegie Hall solo recital debut came only in 1981.         At Curtis, Serkin schooled her in the basics of Mozart and Beethoven, turning a disapproving eye on her youthful love for Rachmaninoff. But it was with his music, as well as that of his fellow Russian Scriabin, that she made her mark.         In the 1970's she recorded two pioneering and acclaimed sets: the entire Scriabin piano sonatas, for the now-defunct Connoisseur label, and the complete solo repertory of Rachmaninoff, on seven LP's for CBS Masterworks.         When Ms. Laredo went to Serkin to ask if he thought she could handle the Rachmaninoff, he gave his blessing. '''You must do it' was the answer he gave me,'' Ms. Laredo said in a 1987 interview with The New York Times.         But preparing for the recordings was a fearsome and wearing task. ''I had to learn the many, many Rachmaninoff pieces that no one plays, and I found out why no one does,'' she said. ''It's because they're so hard.'' She later channeled her love for Rachmaninoff into scholarship, preparing a new edition of his piano preludes for the C.F. Peters music publisher.         The Scriabin LP's came when little of his music was available on record, and they helped spark a surge of his popularity in the United States. Ms. Laredo said that she first heard his music at a concert of Vladimir Horowitz and was dazzled.         Bernard Holland, a Times music critic, wrote of her playing of Scriabin's music: ''Ms. Laredo's sensuous, beautifully controlled playing caught its mad and slightly evil quality.''         Correction:  June 17, 2005, Friday  An obituary of the classical pianist Ruth Laredo on May 27 referred imprecisely to the label that issued her recordings of the Scriabin piano sonatas in 1970. It is Connoisseur Society, not Connoisseur, and it remains in business.       
         Vera Komarkova, a botanist and mountain climber who was among the first women to scale some of the world's highest peaks, died on May 25 in her home in Leysin, Switzerland. She was 62.         The cause was complications of breast cancer, her family said.         In the fall of 1978 the American Women's Himalayan Expedition left the United States for Annapurna in Nepal, the 10th highest mountain in the world. Dr. Komarkova and her climbing partner Irene Miller, now Beardsley, with the help of two Sherpa guides, became the first women and the first Americans to reach the summit.         ''She was an incredibly strong, dedicated climber,'' said Arlene Blum, who led the 10-woman expedition. ''Vera was one of the strongest on our team.''         At the time, it was only the fourth expedition to reach the top, and Annapurna is now thought to be one of the most dangerous of the world's 8,000-meter mountains, a class that includes Everest. Two other members of the team fell to their deaths in the attempt.         It was then generally believed that women were not physically and emotionally strong enough to endure such demanding climbs, and women had problems getting climbing permits or joining men's teams, Ms. Blum and Ms. Beardsley said.         Most of the roughly $80,000 needed for their trip was raised by a T-shirt campaign with the slogan ''A Woman's Place Is on Top.''         In 1984, Dr. Komarkova led another successful Himalayan expedition, to Cho Oyu in Tibet, the world's sixth highest peak. She and her partner were the first women to reach that summit, and it was her last major climb.         Vera Komarkova was born in Pisek, Czechoslovakia, in 1942. Her father was a scientist at Charles University in Prague, where she would earn a master's degree in biology and chemistry in 1964. Throughout her youth, she climbed in Europe, scaling mountains in the Tatras, Carparthians, and the Alps.         Dr. Komarkova studied at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and earned a Ph.D. in biology in 1976. She later became an American citizen.         For her dissertation, Dr. Komarkova produced a detailed study of the alpine flora of the Niwot Range in the Colorado Rockies.         It was published as a two-volume book, ''Alpine Vegetation of the Indian Peaks Area'' (Cramer, Vaduz; 1979), and remains the definitive work on the subject, according to her adviser, Patrick Webber, now of Michigan State University.         She stayed with the university's Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research for several years, climbing the tallest North American mountains and meeting many of the women she would later join on the Himalayan expeditions.         In 1986, Dr. Komarkova moved back to Europe to join the staff of the American College of Switzerland, a campus of Schiller International University, at Leysin. She was a professor of science, primarily alpine ecology, and later a professor of information technology.         She is survived by her mother, Tatiana Ruzickova of Pisek, the Czech Republic; and two sons, Mipam Moudry of Bossonnens, Switzerland, and Dorje Moudry of Leysin.       
         Frances Langford, a mellow contralto who ventured into combat zones with Bob Hope's troupe during World War II and the Korean and Vietnam Wars to serenade tens of thousands of servicemen with ballads that reminded them of the girls they left behind, died yesterday at her home in Jensen Beach, Fla. She was 92.         Her death was announced by her lawyer, Evans Crary Jr., The Associated Press reported.         Although she regarded herself as more of a singer than an actress, she appeared in roughly 30 films and was half of the successful radio comedy duo ''The Bickersons,'' in which she and Don Ameche played a mismatched, querulous couple. He was devoted to ignoring her and concentrating on sleeping, the only time in the day, he said, when he felt alive; she was an insomniac who needed him as a refuge because she couldn't get to sleep. The show became so popular that it received a Sunday night spot of its own.         But among radio listeners, moviegoers and later a vast audience of G.I.'s, Miss Langford was known for songs like ''I'm in the Mood for Love,'' ''You Are My Lucky Star'' and ''Hooray for Hollywood.''         Mr. Hope thought of her as one of his three gypsies -- entertainers who were willing, like him, to travel all over the globe to entertain the troops. The other two were Jerry Colonna, a bulgy-eyed comic who liked to sing ''On the Road to Mandalay,'' and Tony Romano, a guitarist who sang, arranged and accompanied other talent.         Mr. Hope recalled her with characteristic snip: ''She knows just how much sex to pour and still be dignified.'' The troops frequently asked Miss Langford to sing ''I'm in the Mood for Love,'' a ballad by Dorothy Fields and Jimmy McHugh, her hit record from an otherwise forgettable 1935 movie, ''Every Night at Eight,'' which was mostly a vehicle for George Raft and Alice Faye.         ''The greatest thing in my life was entertaining the troops,'' Miss Langford told The Palm Beach Post years later. She said she was fascinated as well as frightened by being in or close to combat zones. On one occasion, near Bizerte in North Africa, she saw six planes shot down. On two occasions she was in planes that developed engine trouble; one of them crash-landed in New South Wales, Australia, on a flight from Guadalcanal. The other plane landed safely, but not before Miss Langford volunteered to don a parachute and jump.         Frances Langford was born April 6, 1913, in Lakeland, Fla., the daughter of Vasco Langford, a carpenter, and his wife, Anna, who was an accomplished pianist. She attended music college briefly but dropped out and began to work in vaudeville. Her first big break came after her mother drove her to Miami and convinced Rudy Vallee, then a popular star of stage and screen, to listen to her. He liked what he heard, asked her to sing on his radio show and even helped her get a start in New York. A small part in a Broadway musical led to radio appearances and a string of movie musicals.         In 1941, Miss Langford made her first appearance on Mr. Hope's radio show, and the visits to the troops started shortly thereafter. She also wrote a column for Hearst newspapers, recounting some of her experiences as an entertainer in wartime.         After the war, she was featured on a radio variety show and returned to nightclub work. She was married three times, first to the actor Jon Hall, from whom she was later divorced, and then to Ralph Evinrude, the manufacturer of outboard motors. They settled in Florida and started a marina, restaurant and gift shop near her 400-acre estate at Jensen Beach. She became more interested in sailing and fishing than singing, but on occasion she would sing at the restaurant.         Mr. Evinrude died in 1986. In 1994, she married Harold Stuart, an assistant secretary of the Air Force in the Truman administration, who survives her.       
         Sue Gunter, a pioneering women's college basketball coach who turned Louisiana State University into a national power in a career spanning four decades, died yesterday at her home in Baton Rouge, La.         Gunter, a member of two basketball halls of fame, was 66.         The cause was respiratory failure, the university announced.         Gunter stopped coaching during the 2003-4 season because of severe emphysema and acute chronic bronchitis. Until then, she had missed only one game as a college coach, for her mother's funeral.         Gunter was a head coach at Middle Tennessee (1962-64), Stephen F. Austin (1964-80) and L.S.U. (1982-2004), reaching the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament 14 times with L.S.U. From 1980 to 1982, she was the women's athletic director at Stephen F. Austin.         Her career coaching record was 708-308. Only Pat Summitt of Tennessee (852-167) and Judy Conradt of Texas (869-278) have won more games in women's basketball.         Gunter was elected to the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame in 2000, and to the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in March.         She turned over the L.S.U. team to Pokey Chatman, who had spent the last 17 seasons with her as a player or as an assistant coach. Gunter, an oxygen tank at her side, watched practice and films.         L.S.U., under Chatman, reached the N.C.A.A. tournament's Final Four the last two seasons.         Sue Gunter was born May 22, 1939, in Walnut Grove, Miss.         She received bachelor's and master's degrees from Peabody College of Nashville in the early 1960's while playing Amateur Athletic Union basketball for Nashville Business College. From 1960 to 1962, she played for United States national teams against those from the Soviet Union.         Her early coaching career offered few luxuries. At Stephen F. Austin, she also coached softball, tennis and track.         ''She was an administrator,'' Chatman told LSUsports.net last year. ''She probably taught a class. She drove the bus. She coached the team. I remember she told me when she became head coach at Stephen F. Austin she was making $6,500 a year and she thought she'd hit the lottery.''         Conradt told The New York Times last year: ''Sue is one of a group of coaches who, early on, made a commitment to the sport when there was no tangible reason to do it. We weren't paid very well. We toiled in obscurity. The joy of being able to coach young women was reward enough.''         In 1980, Gunter was the head coach of the United States Olympic women's basketball team, which never made it to the Moscow Games because of a United States boycott to protest the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan. Gunter, who never married, left no immediate survivors.         ''I've been very fortunate,'' she told the LSU Campus publication last year. ''People will call me on the history of women's college basketball, and I say sometimes that I feel like I am the archives.''         Correction:  August 13, 2005, Saturday  An obituary on Aug. 5 about Sue Gunter, a pioneering women's college basketball coach, misstated her standing on the lifetime victory list. It also misstated another coach's record and the given name of a third coach. Three coaches (not two) surpassed her 708 victories: Pat Summitt, whose record is 882-172 (not 852-167); Jody Conradt (not Judy), 869; and C. Vivian Stringer, 723.       
         Mo Mowlam, the earthy, straight-talking politician who as Britain's Northern Ireland secretary helped negotiate the Good Friday peace settlement in 1998, died Friday morning at a hospice in Canterbury, her family said. She was 55.         Unsteady on her feet at times as a result of radiotherapy treatments for a brain tumor discovered in 1997, Ms. Mowlam fell and hit her head two weeks ago, slipping into a coma from which she never recovered. She left instructions that she not be kept alive artificially if there was no hope of improvement, her family said, and doctors removed her artificial feeding tube earlier this week.         Ms. Mowlam, who retired from politics four years ago, was an unusually blunt and unusually popular member of Parliament. After the radiation treatments caused her hair to fall out, she regularly flung her wig off during negotiations and news conferences, complaining that it made her head itch.         ''I hate the bloody things and have to carry two around with me because I kept losing one,'' she once said.         During the 1998 Labor Party conference, Prime Minister Tony Blair referred to her as ''our Mo'' in passing during his keynote speech, only to have the audience unexpectedly give her a prolonged standing ovation. Although the prime minister joked about it, she later said she thought that he resented being upstaged and felt threatened by her popularity.         In any case, the two fell out politically. He removed her from her Northern Ireland post against her will in 1999, shuffling her to a less important job in the Cabinet Office, and she eventually quit politics, growing increasingly disillusioned with his New Labor government.         But as tributes poured in from across the political spectrum on Friday, the prime minister called Ms. Mowlam ''one of the shrewdest political minds I ever encountered'' and said she was ''great company, utterly irreverent, full of life and fun.''         ''It is no exaggeration to say she transformed the politics not just of Northern Ireland itself but crucially of relations between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom,'' he said, ''and it was this transformation that created the culture in which peacemaking could flourish.''         Marjorie Mowlam was born in 1949 and brought up in Coventry. She had a tough childhood -- her family was invariably short of money, and her father was an alcoholic. She came to politics late, at the age of 38, after working as a college lecturer.         She decided to run for Parliament just five days before the deadline to register as a candidate for the 1987 election and won a seat in Redcar, on the North Sea coast. Immensely charismatic, bawdy, unpretentious and funny, she became an integral part of Mr. Blair's rejuvenated Labor Party, helping lead it into power in the 1997 general election.         She was quickly made Northern Ireland secretary, with a mission to help effect a peace settlement for the warring province. She visited paramilitary prisoners at Maze Prison to win them over to the idea of peace.         But even as she worked hard to build good relations with Sinn Fein, the political arm of the Irish Republican Army, which wants Northern Ireland to become part of the Irish Republic, she alienated unionists, who want it to remain united with Britain and who accused her of being too sympathetic to the republican cause.         She complained that she was increasingly marginalized during the talks that eventually led to the peace agreement, saying she was no more than ''a tea lady.'' After she was removed from the Northern Ireland post, her criticism of the government grew louder. When she finally left politics, she said it had become ''harder and harder to defend what the Labor government is doing.''         In 2002 she published a memoir, ''Momentum,'' in which, among other things, she stated that Mr. Blair and Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the Exchequer, were not getting along.         She is survived by her husband, Jon Norton, and two stepchildren.         Her plain-spokenness extended to shouting and swearing at intransigent politicians from both sides in Northern Ireland, invariably men, and invariably tough combatants. She was once overhead saying to Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, ''Bloody well get on and do it; otherwise I'll head-butt you!''       
         Sandra Feldman, the blunt-spoken former president of the American Federation of Teachers and its local in New York, who emerged from the shadow of her mentor, Albert Shanker, to become a deft and intimidating labor powerhouse on her own, died Sunday night at her home in Manhattan. She was 65.         Alex Wohl, a spokesman for the national union, which Ms. Feldman led from 1997 to 2004, said the cause was breast cancer, which recurred last year and deterred Ms. Feldman from seeking re-election.         A scrappy fighter who rarely minced words, the Brooklyn-born Ms. Feldman took on mayors, school chancellors and American presidents with the same inattention to ceremony with which she dispatched rivals for her union leadership.         As head of the American Federation of Teachers, the nation's second-largest union, with 1.3 million members, she was an impassioned advocate for the public schools that educated her. She worked with members of the Bush administration and members of Congress to write the education law known as No Child Left Behind, which imposed stricter performance standards on all schools receiving federal aid. But she was not timid about assailing President Bush when she thought he was not funneling enough resources to sustain those standards.         She put the power of the United Federation of Teachers, the New York local, with 110,000 members at the time, behind the election of David N. Dinkins as mayor in 1989, an effort that helped him garner white votes. But when he disappointed her by letting a year pass without a new contract, she publicly let him know. ''I feel angry at him,'' she said, and added, ''The mayor had better understand that I'd fight him to the end for the needs of my members.''         At one point in the late 1980's, she fought so ardently for Bernard Gifford to become New York City schools chancellor that Robert F. Wagner Jr., the president of the Board of Education, threatened to resign unless Ms. Feldman backed off.         ''She is part shop steward, part visionary,'' Mr. Wagner said in a comment at the time that seemed to capture her earthy charm.         Yet, even as she could be fierce in fighting battles like smaller class sizes, she had an artful touch in private dealings over the brass-tacks issues of pensions and benefits and often veiled her thoughts.         Randi Weingarten, who succeeded Ms. Feldman as president of the United Federation of Teachers, said, ''People remember her take-no-prisoners kind of attitude, but Sandy was far more pragmatic than people give her credit for.'' She recalled how in 1991 the Dinkins administration planned to lay off 4,000 paraprofessionals, and to save those jobs Ms. Feldman agreed to defer a $40 million portion of a 5 1/2 percent wage increase she had negotiated not long before. ''She was courageous in explaining the difficulties to her members,'' Ms. Weingarten said.         The person to whom she was most wedded in the public eye was Mr. Shanker, who built a rudderless collection of local unions into the United Federation of Teachers, which came to have perhaps the most powerful voice in who would become chancellor. As a 29-year-old union field representative, she was often at Mr. Shanker's side in 1968 when he locked horns with an experimental, largely black community school district in Ocean Hill-Brownsville, Brooklyn, that tried to transfer 13 white, mostly Jewish teachers and administrators.         The conflict was fraught with charges of anti-Semitism and racism, and Ms. Feldman was in a difficult position, having been an advocate for civil rights, working to integrate Howard Johnson restaurants along Route 40 in Maryland. Her instincts were at first to avoid confrontation, Ms. Weingarten recalled.         Although the battle culminated in legislation creating a diluted version of community control in a decentralized school system, the union, by going on strike three times, had proved it could shut down the schools at will and, in a fragmented system, it emerged more powerful than ever with increased job protections for its members.         Hardened in that caldron, Ms. Feldman became the union's secretary and took over its presidency in 1986, when Mr. Shanker became head of the national union. She battled chancellors and mayors for significantly higher pay and improved working conditions for her members.         ''Having lived through the contentious teachers' strikes of the late 1960's, she was wary of any effort to remove due process protections from her membership,'' said Diane Ravitch, the education scholar.         Detractors in government said she sometimes protected teachers' rights at the expense of students, by, for example, winning concessions that put aides rather than teachers in charge of discipline in hallways and cafeterias. Critics also pointed out that she never abandoned her insistence that the school system should not have the right to reassign seasoned teachers to failing schools, even if they were needed there most.         As head of the American Federation of Teachers, she worked to increase federal and state spending for programs for the youngest children in a program she called Kindergarten Plus. She also tried unsuccessfully to devise a merger with the largest national union, the National Education Association.         Ms. Feldman, whom almost everyone called Sandy, was born Sandra Abramowitz in Coney Island in October 1939, about six weeks after the outbreak of war in Europe. The daughter of a milkman and a sickly woman who worked part time in a bakery, she grew up in a tenement and later in a public housing project.         She went to James Madison High School and studied English at Brooklyn College, where she immersed herself in socialist politics and civil rights activities. After her freshman year she married Paul Feldman, whom she met at the college literary magazine. They divorced 17 years later.         Her first full-time appointment was to Public School 34 on the Lower East Side, where she taught fourth grade for three years. ''When I came into that school, there was only one union member,'' she said. ''I organized it immediately.''         She loved to read fiction and sometimes went dancing in salsa and jazz clubs with her second husband, Arthur H. Barnes, senior vice president for external affairs of HIP Health Plan of New York.         Besides Mr. Barnes, she is survived by a brother, Larry Abramowitz of New York City; a sister, Helen Berliner of Wylie, Tex.; two stepchildren, David Barnes and Donna Marie Barnes; and two grandchildren.       
         Molly Yard, for more than half a century an outspoken advocate for liberal causes, who came to national prominence as president of the National Organization for Women in the late 1980's, died yesterday at a nursing home in Pittsburgh. She was 93 and had resided most recently in Arlington, Va., and Washington.         Ms. Yard's son James Garrett confirmed her death.         Active since the 1930's in student and civil rights movements, Ms. Yard served as NOW's president from 1987 until 1991. She was previously the organization's political director.         During her tenure, NOW championed issues including abortion, gay and lesbian rights and the election of women to public office. In 1987, in one of its most vigorous campaigns, it opposed the nomination to the Supreme Court of Judge Robert H. Bork, whom Ms. Yard publicly condemned as ''a Neanderthal.'' She also called for the impeachment of President Ronald Reagan over the Iran-contra affair.         Ms. Yard spent so much time pounding unforgiving marble in various corridors of power that she developed permanent nerve damage in her feet, The Washington Post reported in 1987.         Mary Alexander Yard was born in Shanghai on July 6, 1912, and raised in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, where her parents were Methodist missionaries. At her birth, one of her father's male friends presented him with a beautiful brass bowl. It was meant as a consolation prize. Ms. Yard was the family's third daughter.         Growing up in China, Ms. Yard later said, helped set her on her course as a social activist. She saw many people die of cholera. She also heard screams whose source she could not immediately identify.         ''I asked my father what was going on, and he said it was a young girl whose feet are bound,'' Ms. Yard told The Post in 1987. ''They used to unbind them at night in order for the blood to circulate.''         The Yards lived in China until Ms. Yard was about 13, when her father angered church superiors by proposing that their missions in China be turned over to the Chinese. The family moved to the United States, where Mr. Yard became the director of religious activities for Northwestern University -- until he angered superiors there with his work as a civil rights and labor organizer. Through much of the Depression, Ms. Yard's mother, who ran a mail-order business selling imported Chinese goods, was the family's sole support.         Ms. Yard became politically active as a student at Swarthmore. After discovering that the sorority to which she belonged would not admit Jews, she campaigned successfully to abolish all sororities on campus. She graduated in 1933, with a bachelor's degree in political science.         In 1938, Ms. Yard married a Swarthmore classmate, Sylvester Garrett, keeping her maiden name. When the couple tried to open a joint checking account, Ms. Yard would later recall, they were told they could not do so under two different surnames. If only Ms. Yard had been Mr. Garrett's mistress, the bank told her, it would have been no problem at all.         Mr. Garrett, a noted labor arbitrator who taught at Stanford and elsewhere, died in 1996. Besides her son, of McDonald, Pa., Ms. Yard is survived by another son, John Garrett, of Fairport, N.Y., and five grandchildren. A daughter, Joan Garrett-Goodyear, died in 1992.         After college, Ms. Yard began a career as a social worker but soon realized that politics was a better outlet for her unrelenting energy. As an officer of the American Student Union, a left-wing youth organization, Ms. Yard struck up a long friendship with Eleanor Roosevelt, whom she credited as a deep influence. Ms. Yard was later a board member of Americans for Democratic Action.         During her husband's years at Stanford, Ms. Yard immersed herself in Democratic politics in California, supporting Representative Helen Gahagan Douglas in her Senate race against Richard M. Nixon in 1950. After her family moved to Pittsburgh a few years later, Ms. Yard worked in the civil rights movement and was a local organizer for the March on Washington in 1963. She entered electoral politics as a candidate only once, running unsuccessfully for the Pennsylvania legislature in 1964.         Ms. Yard joined NOW in the early 1970's and for the next decade worked on its campaign, ultimately unsuccessful, to have the equal rights amendment ratified. In 1987, Eleanor Smeal, Ms. Yard's mentor and NOW's departing president, suggested she run for the position. In her mid-70's, Ms. Yard demurred at first.         ''I thought if I were 10 years younger, I would love to do it,'' she told People magazine in 1987. ''Then I remembered Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony never stopped, even in their 80's.''         Ms. Yard's reputation as a forceful negotiator stood her in such good stead that she did not have to be physically present to get results. In 1987, Patricia Blau Reuss, who was the legislative director for the Women's Equity Action League at the time, told The Washington Post what it was like to lobby members of Congress with Ms. Yard as a bargaining chip:         ''We would say, 'Look, you either deal with me or you have to answer to Molly,''' Ms. Reuss said. ''They always relent.''       
         Lea Nikel, an abstract painter who was one of Israel's most esteemed artists, died on Sept. 10 at her home in Moshav Kidron, Israel. She was 86.         The cause was cancer, her nephew Yehuda Bock said.         Ms. Nikel devoted a career of more than 50 years to a form of expressionistic abstraction sometimes called lyrical abstraction. Painting with a brusque, generous touch and favoring high-keyed colors, she created buoyant compositions consisting of rough-edged blocks of color and scribbly, calligraphic lines that together convey a sense of imaginative excitement and urgent sensuousness.         Ms. Nikel was born Lea Nikelsberg in Zhitomir, Ukraine, in 1918, and emigrated with her parents to British Mandatory Palestine in 1920. She began studying with the painter Chaim Gliksberg in Tel Aviv in 1935. A decade later, she studied with Yehezkel Streichman and Avigdor Stematsky, who started their own school because they thought Israeli art schools were too conservative.         Ms. Nikel lived and worked in Paris from 1950 to 1961. She had her first solo exhibition at Chemerinsky Art Gallery in Tel Aviv and her first solo show in Paris at Galerie Colette Allendy in 1957. In 1995, the Tel Aviv Museum of Art presented a career retrospective exhibition of her paintings.         From 1961 to 1977, Ms. Nikel led a peripatetic life. She lived on Macdougal Street in Greenwich Village for a year in the early 60's; in Rome for three years at the end of the 60's; and, from 1973 to 1977, at the Chelsea Hotel in New York. After that she remained in Israel.         Ms. Nikel was included in numerous international group exhibitions, including the Venice Biennale in 1964. In 1995 she received the Israel Prize for painting and in 1997 was made a Chevalier of Arts and Letters by the French minister of culture.         Ms. Nikel continued to paint until just a few days before her death, and it is a measure of the continued vitality of her late work that the Sommer Gallery in Tel Aviv, which specializes in young and emerging artists, mounted an exhibition of new works by her in 2002.         Ms. Nikel is survived by her husband, Sam Leiman; her daughter, Ziva Hanan; three grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren, all of Moshav Kidron; and a sister, Sara Bock, of Rockaway Beach, Queens.       
         Franzi Groszmann, who was believed to be among the last survivors of the parents who put their London-bound children on trains to escape Nazi persecution, in the famed Kindertransport, died on Sept. 20 in Manhattan. She was 100.         Deborah Oppenheimer, producer of the 2000 movie ''Into the Arms of Strangers: Stories of the Kindertransport,'' announced the death.         Ms. Oppenheimer, whose own mother was a Kindertransport child, said she believed that Mrs. Groszmann was the last surviving mother who had placed a child (the author Lore Segal) on a train from Germany, Austria or Czechoslovakia to seek safety in Britain.         The British government had eased immigration restrictions for children under 17 after the violent attack on Jews in Germany in November 1938 known as Kristallnacht, or Night of the Broken Glass.         ''In no time, the suitcase was gone, the child was gone, the other children were gone -- just emptiness,'' Mrs. Groszmann said in the film about watching Lore board the train in Vienna. ''I did not talk. It was awful.''         She relaxed only after she received a postcard from Lore in England saying she was safe.         Ms. Segal told about the Kindertransport (Children's Transport) in her autobiographical novel, ''Other People's Houses,'' drawing a loving portrait of a charming and capable mother. From Dec. 2, 1938, until May 14, 1940, 9,000 to 10,000 children, 7,500 of them Jewish, were sent to Britain.         Each was allowed only one suitcase and one backpack, and was known only by a number. Lore was 152.         The mother and daughter also appeared in Melissa Hacker's Academy Award-winning 1996 film ''My Knees Were Jumping.''         Mrs. Groszmann's husband and Lore's father was Ignatz, the chief accountant of a Vienna bank, who was fired after Hitler took over Austria. At that time Lore was their only child.         In later years, when Lore thought of boarding the train, she had ''no clear recollection'' of her father's being there. She wrote, ''Every time I looked toward them it was my mother's tiny face . . . that I saw smiling steadily toward me.''         In England, Lore met the first of five foster families; with none of them would she feel comfortable. In an interview with The Jewish Week in 2001, she said her mother wrote her: ''Be good. Be obedient. Be neat. Be tidy. Always be nice.''         On the instructions her father gave her before leaving, Lore wrote the Jewish refugee committee asking it to get her parents out of Austria, as well as her grandparents, aunt and twin cousins. Her request was granted, and her parents and the others emigrated to England.         But they found work as domestic servants and could not have children living with them. . She did not live with her relatives again until after the war, when she joined them in the Dominican Republic at the age of 21.         For a time, her father was interned on the Isle of Man as a German-speaking alien. He died in the final week of the war after suffering a series of strokes. Mrs. Groszmann and her daughter lived in a small flat while Lore attended Bedford College in London.         Ms. Segal and her mother and grandmother immigrated to New York from the Dominican Republic in 1951 and lived together in a small apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Mrs. Groszmann worked as a salad cook at Schrafft's and as a sales clerk at a Washington Heights bakery. After helping Lore with her first baby, she trained herself to become a nurse.         In addition to Ms. Segal, Mrs. Groszmann is survived by her brother, Paul Stern, two grandchildren and two great-grandsons.         For many years, Mrs. Groszmann and Ms. Segal lived in different apartments in the same building on Riverside Drive in Manhattan. Each day at 7 a.m., the daughter would take the elevator down to have breakfast with her mother, who until three years ago rose at dawn to squeeze grapefruit juice for the two of them.       
         Ruth M. Siems, a retired home economist whose best-known innovation will make its appearance, welcome or otherwise, in millions of homes tomorrow, died on Nov. 13 at her home in Newburgh, Ind. Ms. Siems, an inventor of Stove Top stuffing, was 74.         The cause was a heart attack, according to the Warrick County coroner's office in Boonville, Ind.         Ms. Siems (pronounced ''Seems'') spent more than three decades on the staff of General Foods, which introduced the Stove Top brand in 1972. Today, Kraft Foods, which now owns the brand, sells about 60 million boxes of it at Thanksgiving, a company spokeswoman said.         Prepared in five minutes on the stove or in the microwave, Stove Top stuffing comes in a range of flavors, including turkey, chicken, beef, cornbread and sourdough.         Comforting or campy, Stove Top stuffing is an enduring emblem of postwar convenience culture. Its early advertising tag line, ''Stuffing instead of potatoes?'' remains in the collective consciousness.         As Laura Shapiro, the author of ''Something From the Oven: Reinventing Dinner in 1950's America'' (Viking, 2004), said in a telephone interview yesterday:         ''Stove Top made it possible to have the stuffing without the turkey, probably something no cook would ever have dreamed of but people eating Thanksgiving dinner might well have thought of: 'Take away everything else; just leave me here with the stuffing!' It's kind of like eating the chocolate chips without the cookies.''         Stove Top's premise is threefold. First, it offers speed.         Second, it divorces the stuffing from the bird, sparing cooks the nasty business of having to root around in the clammy interior of an animal.         Third, it frees stuffing from the yoke of Thanksgiving; it can be cooked and eaten on a moment's notice any day of the year.         In 1975, General Foods was awarded United States Patent No. 3,870,803 for the product, generically called Instant Stuffing Mix. Ms. Siems is listed first among the inventors, followed by Anthony C. Capossela Jr., John F. Halligan and C. Robert Wyss.         The secret lay in the crumb size. If the dried bread crumb is too small, adding water to it makes a soggy mass; too large, and the result is gravel. In other words, as the patent explains, ''The nature of the cell structure and overall texture of the dried bread crumb employed in this invention is of great importance if a stuffing which will hydrate in a matter of minutes to the proper texture and mouthfeel is to be prepared.''         A member of the research and development staff at General Foods, Ms. Siems was instrumental, her sister Suzanne Porter said, in arriving at the precise crumb dimensions -- about the size of a pencil eraser.         Ruth Miriam Siems was born in Evansville, Ind., on Feb. 20, 1931. She earned an undergraduate degree in home economics from Purdue University in 1953, and after graduation took a job at the General Foods plant in Evansville, where she worked on flours and cake mixes. She moved to the company's technical center in Tarrytown, N.Y., not long afterward. Ms. Siems retired in 1985.         Besides Ms. Porter, of Copley, Ohio, Ms. Siems is survived by another sister, Rosemary Snyder, of Chicago; and a brother, David, of Milford, Mich.         As a mark of just how deeply inscribed on the American palate Ms. Siems's stuffing has become, there are several recipes, available on the Internet, that promise to reproduce the taste of Stove Top from scratch, using fresh ingredients.       
         Débora Arango, a prolific artist who at first repelled socially conservative Colombia with stark paintings of nudes and social conflict but who was later celebrated as one of the country's most inventive, daring artists, died on Dec. 4 at her rambling colonial home outside Medellín. She was 98.         Her death was confirmed by a great-nephew, Pedro Miguel Estrada.         In a career that began nearly 80 years ago and lasted until late in life, Ms. Arango produced countless works that often depicted the hurdles and indignities she found in being a woman in a strict Roman Catholic country. She made dramatic paintings of prostitutes, which shocked midcentury sensibilities, and one of a woman giving birth in prison.         Though a product of a traditional, affluent family from the Antioquia province of Colombia, Ms. Arango produced work that pushed the bounds of decorum, vividly touching on delicate and troubling subjects like Colombia's political violence, poverty and brutality. In her work, she depicted a 1950's-era Colombian dictator, Gen. Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, as a toad, and portrayed a military junta as five monkeys wrapped in Colombia's flag.         Ms. Arango always pushed boundaries, even as a young girl. In a favorite story, she talked about how she wore pants to ride horses, unheard of in her time, and about how her father permitted her to drive the family car.         ''In those times in Medellín, there were three women who drove: a foreigner, the daughter of a trucker and me,'' she said.         One of 12 children, Ms. Arango first studied art at 13 at the rigid Catholic school she attended in Medellín and later at the city's Instituto de Bellas Artes. In 1935, she began working with Pedro Nel Gómez, a well-known artist who painted murals that portrayed the powerful and influential of Colombian society.         Despite living amid anti-reform movements, Ms. Arango began to capture social issues in her work, as well as the female body, which she often depicted as corpulent and wrinkled.         Ms. Arango first caused a public stir in 1939 when she exhibited in Antioquia with established male artists. In 1940, after an exhibition in Bogotá, the newspaper El Siglo said of her works, ''They constitute a true attack against the culture and artistic tradition of our capital city.'' Ms. Arango's work also came under assault in Spain in 1955, when the dictator Francisco Franco closed an exhibition of her paintings.         Ms. Arango, like the better-known Mexican painter Frida Kahlo, was inspired by the muralist movement of Mexico, which captured Latin America's roiling history in epic proportions. She never became a muralist, but she did paint large, trying to hammer her message with broad, thick brushstrokes. Her subjects inhabited the seamy side of small-town life: drunken men leaving a bar, a woman roughed up by policemen, an emaciated child in a mother's arms.         ''She did it with brazen language,'' Fernando Botero, Colombia's most renowned artist, said of Ms. Arango's message in a telephone interview from his studio in Paris. ''She was not preoccupied with aesthetics. What was central was expressing herself.''         Her paintings also tackled subjects that in an isolated, provincial country in the 1940's and 50's were best left alone. What she saw as hypocrisy in the church became an important subject for her. In one famous painting, Ms. Arango portrayed a group of nuns circling a caged bird, a cardinal. In another, a boxcar is filled with bodies, a reminder of the relentless political violence that has marked Colombia for decades. Ms. Arango often focused on race and poverty, as well as on corrupt leaders.         ''She was capable of condemning,'' said Alberto Sierra, curator of the Museum of Antioquia in Medellín and an expert on Ms. Arango's work. ''Politically, Débora was a voice of protest as things were unfolding. A lot of artists wait and portray events after they happened.''         As Colombia opened itself up to the world and produced celebrated artists like Mr. Botero and writers like Gabriel García Márquez, Ms. Arango's work eventually found acceptance and critical acclaim.         Though her art has been exhibited in Madrid and the United States, Ms. Arango never sought fame and was reluctant to have her paintings shown. Still, in Colombia art books feature her work, and the Museum of Modern Art in Medellín boasts of the 233 pieces she donated in 1986.         In old age, she continued to work, her paintings climbing the walls of her beloved house in the town of Envigado. She delighted in having visitors, surprising them with her sharp wit.         When one asked her about her relationships with men, whom Ms. Arango's art often portrayed in a less-than-positive light, she said, ''Men never thought much of me, and I never thought much of them, either.''         Her diminishing skills forced her to give up painting in the last year or two of her life. In 2003, shortly before receiving the Cruz de Boyacá, Colombia's most important honor, she recognized the inevitable.         ''There is so much to paint, but the tears come to my eyes and I cannot do it like I would like,'' she said. ''I was very bold, but you start to wear down with the years.''
