         Kiharu Nakamura, a geisha in Tokyo in the 1930's who wrote a popular memoir and taught sopranos how to portray the most famous geisha in fiction, Madama Butterfly, died on Jan. 5 at her home in Jackson Heights, Queens. She was 90.         The report of her death came from Artemis Willis, who is making a documentary film about her.         Miss Nakamura, whose original name was Kazuko Yamamoto, was born on the Japanese island of Hokkaido. Her family moved to Tokyo when she was a child, and at age 15 she joined the Shimbashi Geisha Association. She learned to play the three-stringed lute called the shamisen, to sing ballads in the traditional quavering voice, to dance and otherwise entertain. She adopted the name Kiharu, which means happy spring.         She also learned English, an accomplishment that led to the end of her career as a geisha. Pressed by the military police to report on her foreign clients, she instead married a young diplomat, Shintaro Ota, and moved with him to his post in Calcutta.         They returned to Japan during the war and later divorced, and she eventually married a photographer, Masaya Nakamura. After a second divorce, she moved to New York, where she became a sought-after expert on geisha traditions.         Ms. Nakamura helped the soprano Anna Moffo and many other singers prepare for the role of Cio-Cio-San in Puccini's ''Madama Butterfly,'' teaching them how to walk with their feet together, hold a fan and stand up gracefully from kneeling.         She was also a consultant on the Broadway show ''M. Butterfly,'' and was cited in the acknowledgments of Arthur Golden's 1997 novel ''Memoirs of a Geisha.''         Her own memoir, ''An Edokko Geisha'' (1983), was a best seller in Japan and became a mini-series on Japanese television. She also wrote two other memoirs, as well as autobiographical novels. Her books have not been translated into English.         Miss Nakamura is survived by her companion, Robert E. Lee of Jackson Heights; a son, Masakatsu Ota of Niigata, Japan; and two grandchildren.       
         Amy M. Spindler, the former fashion critic of The New York Times and style editor of its magazine, whose knowledge and fierce opinions held the world's leading designers to task and helped to raise the standard of fashion writing, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 40.         The cause was a brain tumor, said her husband, Roberto Benabib.         Ms. Spindler was never interested in simply putting a dress on a page or talking about hemlines. She recognized that fashion was as important a cultural barometer as music or art and that it should be -- demanded to be -- covered as rigorously as a political campaign.         In an industry more accustomed to flattery and sympathetic reviews, she possessed a rare nerve, upbraiding fashion executives when she thought they were dissembling and beseeching designers to be better than they were.         ''She explained to us how we really feel about fashion,'' Tom Ford, the creative director of Gucci, said yesterday from Los Angeles. ''She saw the relevance of fashion for intelligent people -- saw it in its broadest cultural context.''         And although Ms. Spindler was an early champion of Mr. Ford, she did not put on kid gloves for him. ''Even when she wrote something scathing of about one of my collections, it was constructive, not malicious or cutting,'' he said. ''It was always grounded and concrete.''         Anna Wintour, the editor in chief of Vogue, whom Ms. Spindler regarded as a competitor when she became style editor of The Times Magazine, in 1998, said: ''She took criticism in a new direction. She wasn't afraid to tell the truth.''         Incensed by the fatal overdose in 1997 of Davide Sorrenti, a promising young fashion photographer, Ms. Spindler chided magazine editors for glamorizing ''heroin chic'' by depicting models in a drugged stupor. In a front-page article in The Times, Ms. Spindler wrote: ''What Mr. Sorrenti's death has revealed is that fashion photography is indeed a mirror of the tight-knit world that produces the photographs. And as long as drugs are unchecked in the industry, that image will be difficult to change.''         As a columnist and reviewer, Ms. Spindler applied her tart and witty outlook on such mid-1990's fashion trend setters as the deconstructionist Belgian designers who, after attending one of the strictest couture schools in Europe, started selling what were basically the stitched underpinnings of finished creations, and the reclamationist designers, mostly from Africa, who patched cast-off garments into novel creations. Both trends trickled into the mass market, in touches like unraveling hems, visible seams and mismatched patterns.         In a front-page article on Sept. 5, 1995, she noted a new piety on parade, marked by store windows and catalogs full of monastic robes, pilgrim's boots and dangling crosses. Perhaps, she wrote, ''the financially strained fashion industry is seeking salvation from above.''         A Midwesterner in both her mettle and plain English, Ms. Spindler was born in Michigan City, Ind. After graduating from Indiana University in 1985 with a degree in journalism, she moved to New York and worked in entry-level jobs at several Condé Nast magazines. In two years, she went from writing press releases for Bride's magazine to turning out highly detailed feature articles for The Daily News Record, the men's fashion journal of Fairchild Publications. Even in her reporting of the nuts and bolts of the garment trade, an authoritative voice -- and, equally, a sharp wit -- began to emerge.         Ms. Spindler was subsequently made associate features editor of W Europe in Paris, a city she would come to know as well as New York. In 1993, she joined The Times as a columnist on the Tuesday fashion page, where she used her training at Fairchild to engage in scoop warfare with the former colleagues at Women's Wear Daily. In 1994, The Times created the position of fashion critic for Ms. Spindler, making her an equal with the paper's other critics and acknowledging the weight of her view on a subject she not only knew in depth but also believed should be taken seriously.         In the midst of being treated for breast cancer, in 1998, she married Mr. Benabib, a television producer, whom she had met on a blind date in 1995. In the fall of 1998, after recovering from that cancer, she took the job of style editor of The Times Magazine, bringing a cultural vibrancy to the pages that had not existed before.         Her illness was not a subject she dwelled on, though she knew everything about it. She continued to supervise the coverage in the style sections and supplements of the magazine until last summer. In November, she relinquished that post and was named critic at large for culture and style.         Besides her husband, Ms. Spindler is survived by her mother, Sally Spindler of Tampa, Fla., and a sister, Bonnie, of San Francisco.       
         Eileen Darby Lester, a photographer who helped immortalize theatrical productions, taking pictures of more than 500 Broadway shows and photographing stars like Olivier, Dietrich and Brando, died on March 30 at a nursing home in Long Beach, N.Y. She was 87.         Her death followed a fall in front of her house in Point Lookout, N.Y., in November from which she never recovered, said Mary Henderson, who is writing a book about her.         Mrs. Lester, whose photographic credits used her maiden name, Darby, recorded images that have helped define the memory of some great productions. These include the picture of a terrified Blanche DuBois, played by Jessica Tandy, at the feet of a menacing Stanley Kowalski (Marlon Brando) in Tennessee Williams's ''Streetcar Named Desire.''         Her photograph of the original production of Arthur Miller's ''Death of a Salesman,'' showing Jo Mielziner's entire set, was widely published.         Among the stars she photographed were Tallulah Bankhead, the Lunts, Helen Hayes, Gregory Peck, Katharine Hepburn and Paul Robeson. Other assignments included shooting Mayor Fiorello La Guardia at Yankee Stadium, Leonard Bernstein and President John F. Kennedy and his wife, Jacqueline.         Eileen Darby was born in Portland, Ore., on May 12, 1916. Her father was an engineer who worked for the federal government and liked to photograph the dams and other large projects on which he worked. He taught his daughter photography and helped her set up her own darkroom, Dr. Henderson said.         Mrs. Lester studied biology at Marylhurst University near Portland, but left college at 20 to pursue photography in Manhattan.         She got a job with Pix, a Manhattan photo agency founded by Alfred Eisenstaedt. There she developed particular expertise at processing photographs and a reputation for going beyond what was necessary to make her subjects feel comfortable, Dr. Henderson said. She once turned down a chance to shoot Ingrid Bergman, whom she greatly admired, for fear of giving her a cold that she had.         In 1941 she left Pix and joined a few friends to form Graphic House, a photo agency. Many professional photographers dropped off their film there for processing, and she got to know them. Through a Life magazine photographer, she met Roy Lester, who eventually took over management of the agency and whom she married in 1944.         It was for Graphic House that many of her most notable pictures were taken. They were sold to many prominent publications.         Mr. Lester died in 1976. Mrs. Lester is survived by a daughter, Virginia Teslik of West Hills, Calif.; her sons Roy Jr., of Long Beach; John, of Mountain Lakes, N.J.; and Patric of St. Louis and San Diego; and six grandchildren.         Mrs. Lester stopped taking theatrical pictures after her husband died, Dr. Henderson said, because she felt dispirited about Broadway's new directions after the musical ''Hair'' opened in 1968.         Correction:  May 18, 2004, Tuesday  An obituary on April 13 about Eileen Darby, a photographer of Broadway productions, misstated Alfred Eisenstaedt's role at Pix, a photo agency where she worked. He was an early photographer there, not the founder. The agency was founded by Leon Daniels. A reader pointed out the error by email on the day of publication. This correction was delayed for research into conflicting accounts of the agency's early days; some described Eisenstaedt as a co-founder.       
         Ellen Auerbach, a photographer best known for innovative portraits and advertising images made during the Weimar Republic in Germany in the early 1930's, died on Friday at New York Weill Cornell Center , according to a friend, the artist Christine Graf. She was 98 and lived in Manhattan.         While in her twenties, together with her colleague and friend Grete Stern, the then Ellen Rosenberg formed a commercial photography studio in Berlin named Ringl & Pit. It was during the days of the liberal Weimar Republic, and they were intent on cracking what had been the male-dominated field of photography.         From 1929 to 1933 the two women collaboratively produced advertising, still lifes and studio portraits that reflected the energetic, experimental style of their mentor, Walter Peterhans, a professional photographer who taught at the legendary Bauhaus design school. Their pictures were part of a wave of innovation in European design and photography that today is referred to as the New Vision, and that temporarily erased distinctions between commercial and artistic motives in photography.         The partnership of Mrs. Auerbach and Ms. Stern produced offbeat, often humorous photographs, frequently of women, which were influenced by both Constructivism and Surrealism. One of their best-known advertising pictures, for a hair product called Pétrole Hahn, shows a lifelike female mannequin holding a bottle of lotion; only on close inspection is it clear that the hand in question belongs to a real woman. In their portraiture, they sometimes depicted their sitters with eyes closed or half shut, as if dreaming. In addition, they experimented with mirrors and with unusual camera angles in an attempt to disrupt familiar perspectives.         Relatively little of Ringl & Pit's work has survived, but it was reproduced and exhibited widely at the time it was made. In 1933, Mrs. Auerbach and Ms. Stern received first prize at an international exhibition in Brussels for ''Komol,'' an advertising still life constructed like a collage out of layers of paper, wire screen and artificial curls of hair.         Despite their success, the photographers closed their studio the same year, shortly after Hitler came to power. Weimar was finished. Ms. Stern and Mrs. Auerbach, who were both Jews, were among the fortunate few who realized what was happening. (''In a country with concentration camps, you cannot live,'' Mrs. Auerbach remembered, and they quickly left Germany.)         Mrs. Auerbach emigrated to Tel Aviv, London and, in 1937, the United States. Ms. Stern left for London and later Argentina.         Mrs. Auerbach continued her career as a photographer through the 1950's, although she gave up the rigors of the studio for more anecdotal and lyrical forms of documentation. She photographed the artists Fairfield Porter and Willem de Kooning with a casual directness in 1944, and in the mid-1950's accompanied Eliot Porter on a trip to photograph Mexican churches. But her interests were increasingly focused on children and the psychology of childhood development. In 1965 she began working as an educational therapist at the Educational Institute for Learning and Research in New York, where for 19 years she taught children with learning disabilities.         Ellen Auerbach was born Ellen Rosenberg in Karlsruhe, Germany, on May 20, 1906. After high school she decided to become an artist and studied sculpture for three years at an art school in Karlsruhe and, in 1928, at the Academy of Art in Stuttgart. While studying there her uncle gave her a camera, and it led her to abandon sculpture for photography, primarily because she thought she might earn a living. She sought out Walter Peterhans in Berlin, where he maintained a successful commercial studio, and asked to be his student. He agreed, and for these lessons Mrs. Auerbach was joined by another private student, Grete Stern.         The two young women quickly became fast friends. When Mr. Peterhans decided to shut down his Berlin studio and move to Dessau, they arranged to take over the premises and to operate as Ringl & Pit. According to the photographers, the studio name was simply a combination of their childhood nicknames: Grete Stern was called Ringl and Ellen Rosenberg was called Pit. But in addition, the name had the advantage of being ambiguous in terms of gender and ethnicity.         When the rise of Hitler forced the women to dissolve their partnership in 1933, Ms. Stern moved to London and opened a studio there. Mrs. Auerbach and her future husband, Walter Auerbach, a stage designer and photographer, moved to Tel Aviv, then part of Palestine, and opened a studio specializing in portraits of children. The Auerbachs were divorced in 1945. Ms. Stern died in 1999, in Buenos Aires, at age 94. Mrs. Auerbach has no immediate survivors.         Interest in her early work from the Ringl & Pit studio was kindled in this country in the 1980's, when museum curators and private collectors began to research European Modernism of the 1920's and 1930's. The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art added two Ringl & Pit prints to its collection in 1983 and in 1987 reproduced them in the book, ''Photography: A Facet of Modernism.''       
         Dr. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, the psychiatrist whose pioneering work with terminally ill patients helped to revolutionize attitudes toward the care of the dying, died Tuesday at her home in Scottsdale, Ariz. She was 78.         She died after losing consciousness last week, according to her son, Kenneth. She had recently suffered a series of infections. As she neared her own death after debilitating strokes in the late 1990's, Dr. Kübler-Ross appeared to accept it, as she had tried to help so many others to do.         ''I always say that death can be one of the greatest experiences ever,'' she wrote in an autobiography in 1997. ''If you live each day of your life right, then you have nothing to fear.''         Dr. Kübler-Ross was credited with helping end centuries-old taboos in Western culture against openly discussing and studying death. She also helped change the care of many terminally ill patients to make death less psychologically painful, not only for the dying, but also for their doctors and nurses -- and not least for the survivors.         Although the care she sought is by no means universal, she profoundly changed the way the medical profession is asked to look at death. Her greatest influence came through her writings, especially her 1969 best-seller, ''On Death and Dying,'' which remains in print around the world.         She also gave many lectures and distributed tape recordings of them, conducted extensive research into what she described as the five stages of death based on thousands of interviews with patients and health care professionals and did groundbreaking work in counseling dying patients.         She was a powerful intellectual force behind creating a hospice system in the United States through which palliative care and psychological support are provided for many terminally ill people. And she helped to turn thanatology, the study of physical, psychological and social problems associated with dying, into an accepted medical discipline.         ''Dr. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross was a true pioneer in raising the awareness among the physician community and the general public about the important issues surrounding death, dying and bereavement,'' Dr. Percy Wooten said when he was president of the American Medical Association in 1998.         Dr. Wooten said her work was part of the basis for the A.M.A.'s efforts to encourage the medical profession to improve care at the end of life.         The A.M.A was one of her early supporters, though many of its members at first vigorously opposed her.         In the later part of her career, she embarked on research to verify the existence of life after death, conducting, with others, thousands of interviews with people who recounted near-death experiences, particularly of those declared clinically dead by medical authorities but later revived.         Her prestige generated widespread interest and devoted followers.         The work aroused deep skepticism in medical and scientific circles. Her assertions that she had evidence of an afterlife saddened many colleagues, some of whom said she had abandoned rigorous science and had, perhaps, succumbed to her own fears of death.         ''For years, I have been stalked by a bad reputation,'' she wrote in her 1997 autobiography, ''The Wheel of Life: A Memoir of Living and Dying.'' ''Actually, I have been pursued by people who have regarded me as the Death and Dying Lady. They believe that having spent more than three decades in research into death and life after death qualifies me as an expert on the subject. I think they miss the point. The only incontrovertible fact of my work is the importance of life.''         Whatever scientists think about her views of life after death, they continue to be influenced by her methods of caring for the terminally ill. Before ''On Death and Dying,'' terminally ill patients were routinely left to face death in a miasma of loneliness and fear, because doctors, nurses and families were generally ill equipped to deal with death.         Dr. Kübler-Ross changed that for many, though by no means for all, dying people. By the 1980's, the study of dying became part of medical and health-care education in United States. ''Death and Dying'' became an indispensable manual, both for professionals and family members.         Weighing barely two pounds at birth, Elisabeth Kübler was the first of triplets born to Ernst and Emma Villiger Kübler on July 8, 1926, in Zurich.         By the sixth grade, she wanted to be a doctor. But her father angrily opposed the plan, telling her she could resign herself to being his secretary in the office supply business that he managed or spend the rest of her life as a maid.         ''That's all right with me,'' she said she replied.         After her schooling, she volunteered at the largest hospital in Zurich to help refugees from Nazi Germany. When World War II ended, she hitchhiked through nine war-shattered countries, helping open first-aid posts. In Poland, her visit to the Maidanek death camp narrowed her professional goal. She would become a psychiatrist to help people deal with death.         She received her medical degree from the University of Zurich in 1957. Within a year, she moved to the United States; married Dr. Emanuel K. Ross, an American neuropathologist she had met at the university; began her internship at Community Hospital in Glen Cove, N.Y.; and become a research fellow at Manhattan State Hospital.         At the hospital, she was appalled by what she called the routine neglect and abuse of dying patients. After badgering her supervisors, she was allowed to develop programs under which to give the patients individual care and counseling.         In 1962, she became a teaching fellow at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Denver. A small, outwardly shy woman who spoke with a heavy German accent, she was nervous when asked to fill in for a popular professor and master lecturer. At first, she was ignored.         But the hall became noticeably quieter when she brought out a 16-year-old patient who was dying of leukemia and asked the students to interview her. Now it was they who seemed nervous.         When Dr. Kübler-Ross prodded the students, they asked the patient about blood tests, chemotherapy and other clinical questions. Finally, the teenager exploded in anger and began posing her own questions.         What was it like not to be able to dream about the high-school prom? Or going on a date? Or growing up? ''Why won't people tell you the truth?'' she demanded.         When the lecture ended, many students had been moved to tears.         ''Now you're acting like human beings, instead of scientists,'' Dr. Kübler-Ross said.         Her lectures began to draw standing-room-only audiences of medical and theology students, members of the clergy and social workers -- but few doctors.         In 1965, Dr. Kübler-Ross became an assistant professor in psychiatry at the University of Chicago Medical School, where a group of theology students approached her for help in studying death. She suggested a series of conversations with dying patients, who would teach the professionals.         At first, staff doctors objected to the program, arguing that patients should be shielded from thoughts of death. Avoiding the subject entirely, particularly when treating the young, physicians and therapists would meet a dying child's questions with comments like, ''Take your medicine, and you'll get well,'' Dr. Kübler-Ross wrote in ''On Death and Dying,'' which incorporated her account of the Chicago seminars.         She said that children instinctively knew that the answers they received about their prognoses were lies and that the deceit made them feel punished and alone. With an associate, the Rev. Carl Nighswonger, she interviewed dying patients at Billings Memorial, the university's teaching hospital, while the theology students observed from a one-way glass. The terminally ill were eager to talk.         To bring public pressure to change hospital standards, she agreed to a request by Life magazine in 1965 to interview a seminar patient, Eva, who said that her doctors had treated her arrogantly. The Life article angered the hospital administrators, who said the hospital wanted to be famous not for its dying patients, but rather for those it saved. Doctors were ordered not to cooperate further, and the lecture hall for her next seminar was empty.         But the hospital switchboard was overwhelmed with calls in reaction to the article; mail piled up, and Dr. Kübler-Ross was invited to speak at other colleges and universities.         As for Eva, Dr. Kübler-Ross recounted, she ended up dying cold and alone. Gradually, the medical profession moved toward accepting new approaches to treating the terminally ill, although living wills and patient care directives do not always prevent patients from being subjected to neglect or to invasive medical care at the end of life.         From her patient interviews, Dr. Kübler-Ross identified the five now famous stages that many patients go through in confronting their deaths. Often, denial is the first stage. As his condition worsens and denial is impossible, the patient displays anger, the ''Why me?'' stage.         That followed by a bargaining period. ''Yes, I'm going to die, but if I diet and exercise can I do it later?'' When the patient sees that bargaining will not work, depression often sets in.         The final stage is acceptance, a period in which the patient is ready to let go.         Not all dying patients follow the same progression, Dr. Kübler-Ross said, but most experience two or more stages. Moreover, she found, people who are experiencing traumatic life changes like divorces often experience similar stages. Another conclusion she reached was that the acceptance of death came most easily for people who could look back and feel that they had not wasted their lives.         Among the patients whom she interviewed in the late 60's was a woman, Mrs. Schwartz, who had been pronounced dead but hours later was found by a nurse to be alive. Dr. Kübler-Ross said Mrs. Schwartz was able to repeat conversations of others that occurred around her when she was clinically dead, including a joke told by a doctor. Doctors and medical students called the episode a hallucination, but Dr. Kübler-Ross thought it merited further investigation, and she began to an effort to verify existence after death.         At a psychiatric workshop, she was quoted as saying: ''I know for a fact that there is life after death,'' and promptly received a barrage of criticism from scientists. The disapproval, plus what she called institutional politics, caused her to leave hospital work in 1973.         By then, she was receiving requests from around the world to give seminars on death and dying, and she began to speak at workshops for the dying about what she called ''life after life,'' a happy condition in which physical pain and mental anguish are absent.         She and associates talked to thousands of patients like Mrs. Schwartz and said they found common strains in the interviews. Patients reported that their experiences after clinical death were remarkably free of pain; that they were aware of precisely where they were at death and of seeming to float out of their bodies; that they seemed not to be suddenly alone but still with family members or friends; that they felt as if they were guided to a place of psychic energy, light, love and warmth greater than any they knew in life; and that they did not want to return.         As Dr. Kübler-Ross became increasingly interested in spiritual phenomena, she sought her own out-of-body experience. Robert Monroe, an engineer from Virginia who wrote ''Journeys Out of the Body,'' invited her -- at a time when, as it turned out, she was seriously ill with a bowel obstruction -- to participate in experiments with a group of physicians, psychiatrists from the Menninger Foundation and engineers. She lay on a waterbed in a small laboratory, connected with polygraphs and earphones through which she heard tapes of waves, as she was instructed on how to relax.         ''I was on the ceiling,'' she recounted. ''I was so excited that you couldn't believe it. It was really the highlight of my life.''         She repeated the experiment, and she said her illness disappeared.         In her lectures, she began describing more of her out-of-body experiences, some of which she said were at first terrifying but ultimately uplifting. She also talked of encountering spirit guides, including Mrs. Schwartz, who, she said, appeared 10 months after her death and told Dr. Kübler-Ross to continue her work, promising, ''We will help you.''         In the late 70's, Dr. Kübler-Ross built a center on 42 acres in the hills of Escondido, Calif., where she and others could ''expound theories of survival of the spirit after death in the form of a living entity.''         When skeptics challenged her accounts of spirit guides, she said people in the modern age had difficulty accepting them, because they ''are no longer in touch with their own spirituality.''         In 1976, she fell under the sway of Jay Barham, a former Arkansas sharecropper who had founded the Church of the Facet of Divinity and said he was able to channel spirits and communicate with them. Dr. Kübler-Ross talked about setting up a worldwide network of franchised centers with him and his wife to counsel on the problems of dying and living. His program was investigated by the San Diego district attorney's office because of accusations of sexual misbehavior. She severed ties with him, and years later acknowledged that she had been mistaken about him and that he had deceived many people.         Dr. Kübler-Ross's reputation was seriously damaged, and her credibility waned. Moreover, her channeling sessions, combined with a heavy travel schedule, contributed to the breakup of her marriage, and her husband left her in 1979.         Her center in California burned, and the police suspected arson. In 1984, she set up another center, in Virginia, to care for children with AIDS. That center also burned, in 1994, and again arson was suspected. After the second fire, she moved to Scottsdale to be near her son, Kenneth, a freelance photographer.         That year, when Dr. Ross was dying, he moved to a condo in Scottsdale near Dr. Kübler-Ross, and she and Kenneth cared for him. Dr. Kübler-Ross is also survived by a daughter, Barbara Ross Rothweiler, a clinical psychologist, of Wausau, Wis.; and one of her triplet sisters, Eva, of Basel, Switzerland; and two granddaughters.         As Dr. Kübler-Ross's health failed in the late 90's, she acknowledged that she was in pain and ready for her life to end. But she said: ''I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that there is no death the way we understood it. The body dies, but not the soul.''       
         Rachael Dunaven Yocom, a dance educator and theorist, died on Nov. 14 in Tucson, said Cora Cahan, president of the New 42nd Street redevelopment organization and a former student. She was 88.         Born in Corvallis, Ore., Dr. Yocom taught dance at schools and universities in Oregon, Idaho and Utah after receiving her doctorate at New York University in 1951. In New York City, she was chairwoman of the dance department from 1954 to 1972 at the High School of Performing Arts, the subject of the movie ''Fame,'' and was teacher in charge of the school from 1973 to 1975.         Dr. Yocom trained generations of New York dancers, among them Jacqulyn Buglisi, Laura Dean, Eliot Feld, Arthur Mitchell, Eleo Pomare, Ben Vereen, Edward Villella, Dudley Williams and Ms. Cahan. She wrote several books on physical education, sports and dance, including ''Modern Dance Techniques and Teaching'' (1946), written with Gertrude Shurr, an early Martha Graham dancer and longtime colleague. Dr. Yocom also wrote songs and was a dance photographer.         Dr. Yokom is survived by two sisters, Ruth Carkin of Tucson and Roberta Jean Fox of Eugene, Ore., and a brother, Raymond, of Lancaster, Pa.
