         Teresa Wright, the high-minded ingénue who marshaled intelligence and spunk to avoid being typecast as another 1940's ''sweater girl'' and became the only actor to be nominated for Academy Awards for her first three films, died on Sunday at Yale-New Haven Hospital. She was 86.         The cause was a heart attack, her daughter, Mary-Kelly Busch, said.         Miss Wright had many parts on Broadway and once performed at a White House dinner for President Franklin D. Roosevelt, but her meteoric landing in Hollywood in 1941 is the stuff of legend.         After seeing her on Broadway, Samuel Goldwyn, the legendary producer, asked her to play the role of Bette Davis's daughter in ''The Little Foxes'' in 1941. Her performance in the film moved its director, William Wyler, to tell The New York Times that she was the most promising young actress he had ever directed.         She proved his point by being nominated for an Academy Award for best supporting actress for the picture. The next year, she was nominated for best actress for her next role, opposite Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig's wife in ''The Pride of the Yankees,'' and won the Oscar for best supporting actress as the love interest of Greer Garson's war-bound son in ''Mrs. Miniver.''         Her work included a starring role in Wyler's ''Best Years of Our Lives,'' winner of the best-picture Oscar in 1946; playing opposite Marlon Brando in his first movie, ''The Men,'' in 1950; and creating the character of Charlie, the innocent but suspicious niece of a serial killer, in Alfred Hitchcock's harrowing ''Shadow of a Doubt'' in 1943.         After the 1950's, she drifted away from movies and worked on the stage in roles like Linda Loman opposite George C. Scott's Willy in a 1975 Broadway production of ''Death of a Salesman.'' She was nominated for three Emmy Awards for her dramatic roles on television and in 1997 appeared in a cinematic adaptation of John Grisham's ''Rainmaker.''         For all her allure as the fetching ''girl next door,'' Miss Wright fiercely fought not to be a glamour girl. She loathed pictures in bathing suits and interviews with fan magazines, and told Goldwyn as much. He assured her he was not of ''the bathing suit school of Hollywood producers,'' according to The Times in 1942, and promised to promote her more ethereal talents.         ''There would be no leg art, no whispered romances for the columnists, no orchid and ermine setting for her background,'' her contract stipulated, according to The Times.         But Miss Wright's disregard for Hollywood's demands eventually caused Goldwyn to terminate her contract, in 1948. In their highly publicized exchange, he said she was lax in publicizing her pictures. She said movies had become too brazenly commercial.         ''I was going to be Joan of Arc,'' she said in an interview with The New York Post in 1969, ''and all I proved was that I was an actress who would work for less money.''         For her next picture, ''The Men,'' instead of the $125,000 she had once commanded, she received $20,000, but her co-star was Marlon Brando.         Muriel Teresa Wright was born on Oct. 27, 1918, in Manhattan. She dropped her first named in her early 20's when she found another Muriel Wright was already registered with Actors' Equity.         Her parents separated soon after she was born, and her father, an insurance salesman, farmed her out to various relatives in New York and New Jersey. She did not start school until she was 8, and did not graduate from high school in Maplewood, N.J., until she was almost 20.         She was inspired to become an actress by seeing Helen Hayes in ''Victoria Regina'' on Broadway while still a student. She played leading parts in high school plays, but a teacher told her to stick with typing.         Another teacher helped her get a scholarship to the Wharf Theater in Provincetown, Mass., the summer of her junior year. That led to summer stock work, an understudy role on Broadway in ''Our Town'' and, in 1939, the part of Mary in ''Life With Father,'' based on the memoirs of Clarence Day. After seeing it, Goldwyn went backstage to hire her.         Miss Wright was married for 10 years to Niven Busch, a screenwriter and novelist. She married the playwright Robert Anderson in 1959, and they divorced in the early 1970's. Ms. Busch, Miss Wright's daughter, said the two remained close.         In addition to her daughter, who lives in Clinton, Conn., Miss Wright is survived by her son, Niven Perence Busch of Indianapolis, and two grandchildren.         In 1998, Miss Wright was asked to throw the first pitch at a Yankees game in honor of the anniversary of Lou Gehrig's famous farewell speech to fans in 1939, the climax of ''Pride of the Yankees.'' She said it was her first game. But after years of ignoring baseball, she then became a fervent fan herself, raptly following the Yankees on television and at their stadium.         ''The whole thing is pure theater to me,'' she explained.       
         Charlotte Kempner Beyers, a documentary filmmaker whose works were among the first to introduce students to the realities of AIDS, died on March 10 at her home in Palo Alto, Calif. She was 73.         The cause was complications of lymphoma, her family said.         The producer and writer of 15 films, Ms. Beyers began her career as a print journalist, writing about science and education for a variety of publications. She made her first film, ''AIDS in Your School,'' after a brother-in-law's death from AIDS in 1985. That film, along with her later ones about AIDS, was distributed to schools and youth groups by the World Health Organization.         Ms. Beyers's other films include ''A Is for AIDS'' and ''AIDS and Women: The Greatest Gamble,'' as well as movies about drug abuse, disability and homelessness.         Charlotte Kempner was born in Manhattan on Dec. 8, 1931; her father, S. Marshall Kempner, was a prominent investment banker. She earned a bachelor's degree in English from Stanford University in 1953 and a master's in journalism from Stanford in 1968.         Ms. Beyers's first marriage, to Gerald Davis, ended in divorce. Her second husband, Robert West Beyers, died in 2002. She is survived by a sister, Phyllis Kempner; four children from her first marriage: Pamela Davis Kivelson, Nancy Stewart, Alan Davis and Cynthia Kanner; three stepchildren: Bill Beyers, Robbie Beyers and Amy Theorin; and 13 grandchildren and step-grandchildren.       
         Louise Westergaard O'Neil, a theatrical producer best known for the hit Broadway musical revue ''Sophisticated Ladies,'' died on May 6 in New York. She was 67 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was leukemia, her family said.         Based on the music of Duke Ellington, ''Sophisticated Ladies,'' which starred Gregory Hines, Judith Jamison and Hinton Battle, opened in 1981 at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater and ran for nearly two years. Mr. Battle won a Tony Award, as did the costume designer, Willa Kim.         Ms. O'Neil, known professionally as Louise Westergaard, was one of several producers of ''Sophisticated Ladies.'' She was so confident of the show's chances that she even persuaded her mother's dry cleaner to become an investor.         She was also a producer, on Broadway, of ''Say Goodnight, Gracie,'' starring Frank Gorshin as George Burns, which ran for 10 months in 2002 and 2003, and of the musical revues ''Dream'' (1997) and ''Stardust'' (1987).         Ms. O'Neil's productions elsewhere included ''Tovah: Out of Her Mind,'' starring Tovah Feldshuh, at the Jewish Repertory Theater in 1996; and the musical ''Poppy,'' by Peter Nichols, staged by the Royal Shakespeare Company in London in 1982.         Louise Arnold was born in Manhattan on Sept. 2, 1937, and earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago. She was later artistic director of Theater of the Open Eye, a New York-based company founded by the choreographer Jean Erdman and her husband, the mythologist Joseph Campbell.         Ms. O'Neil's first marriage, to John Westergaard, ended in divorce. She is survived by her husband, Stephen O'Neil, whom she married in 1989; two sons and two daughters from her first marriage, Emile, Kermit, Cathrine and Elizabeth; and three grandchildren.       
         Anne Bancroft, the stage and film star whose signature triumphs in a 50-year career ranged from the courageous Annie Sullivan in ''The Miracle Worker'' to the hungrily seductive Mrs. Robinson in ''The Graduate,'' died on Monday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 73 and had homes in Manhattan and Los Angeles. The cause was uterine cancer, said John Barlow, a spokesman for Ms. Bancroft's husband, Mel Brooks.         Graced with a sultry voice and expressive mouth, Ms. Bancroft could appear both tough and vulnerable, and she eagerly sought out nearly every kind of role, maturing effortlessly over the decades. She lent a singular potency to parts as varied as Brecht's ''Mother Courage'' and the mother superior of a convent, and from an aging ballerina to Prime Minister Golda Meir of Israel. She repeatedly won praise for her work, as well as an Academy Award and two Tonys.         Arthur Penn, who directed her award-winning Broadway performances in ''Two for the Seesaw'' and ''The Miracle Worker,'' both by William Gibson, put it this way: ''More happens in her face in 10 seconds than happens in most women's faces in 10 years.'' Broadway lights were scheduled to be dimmed tonight in her honor.         Ms. Bancroft worked hard to get beneath the surface, to inhabit a role as deeply as possible. While rehearsing for her role as the young Helen Keller's teacher in ''The Miracle Worker,'' she put tape over her eyes better to understand what it was like to be blind, learned sign language and spent time at a home for the visually impaired. Preparing for ''Golda,'' she traveled to Israel and got to know and observe Meir. She was more interested in performance than theory, although she was a member of the Actors Studio early in her career. The actor Rod Steiger once gave her a copy of Stanislavsky's writings on acting. ''I still have it,'' she said some years later, ''but I've never read it.''         The landmarks in Ms. Bancroft's acting life were, unquestionably, the two Gibson plays and ''The Graduate.'' She had already accumulated a long list of credits in TV dramas when she moved to Hollywood in the early 1950's to join the crowd of young hopefuls jostling for jobs in second- or third-rate films. She was among the few who found steady work, appearing in more than a dozen grade-C features with titles like ''Treasure of the Golden Condor,'' ''Gorilla at Large'' -- ''I played the title role'' -- and ''Demetrius and the Gladiators.'' Disenchanted after five years or so, and newly divorced, she headed back to New York with the promise of an audition for a new Broadway play called ''Two for the Seesaw.''         It was a two-character play, with Henry Fonda starring as a depressed Midwestern lawyer with marital troubles who comes to New York and meets Gittel Mosca, an attractive, thoroughly quirky young bohemian girl from the Bronx. They are two lost souls who, though their life styles are worlds apart, manage to help one another. Ms. Bancroft, who happened to be not only attractive and quirky but also Bronx-born and raised, auditioned and got the job. After a rocky start -- she had virtually no stage experience -- she quickly settled into the role. When the play opened in 1958, Ms. Bancroft stole the show and ultimately won a Tony Award as best supporting actress.         When the next Gibson-Penn theater project took shape the following year -- the story of Helen Keller and Annie Sullivan -- they knew who would play Sullivan from Day 1. The part of the hostile, 10-year-old Helen went to Patty Duke. Between them, Ms. Bancroft and Ms. Duke tore up the stage as Sullivan struggled to communicate with and calm her raging young charge, eventually breaking through the child's defensive shell. ''The Miracle Worker'' was a resounding hit, and Ms. Bancroft came away with her second Tony Award, this time as best actress. Tonys also went to Mr. Penn, Mr. Gibson and the play's producer, Fred Coe. Two years, two plays, two Tonys. And when ''The Miracle Worker'' was made into a film in 1962, both Ms. Bancroft and Ms. Duke won Academy Awards.         Hollywood now had a new star, and Ms. Bancroft was offered scripts rather better than, say, ''Gorilla at Large.'' She appeared with Peter Finch in ''The Pumpkin Eater'' (1964), Harold Pinter's adaptation of a novel by Penelope Mortimer about a woman driven into a nervous breakdown by her husband's casual philandering. Her work brought her an Oscar nomination. Next came ''The Slender Thread'' (1965), in which she played a housewife whose crumbling marriage leads her to attempt suicide.         By the time ''The Graduate'' came along, she was more than ready to play the alpha female and she got her wish with the character of Mrs. Robinson, the bored predator whose sexual binges with young Benjamin Braddock, the son of her husband's law partner are mechanical but necessary props for her self-indulgent ego. Directed by Mike Nichols, with a melancholic soundtrack of songs by Simon and Garfunkel, ''The Graduate'' was hailed as a winning social satire. Bosley Crowther, writing in The New York Times, called it ''devastating and uproarious'' and hailed Ms. Bancroft's ''sullenly contemptuous and voracious performance.'' Mr. Nichols won an Oscar, while nominations went to Ms. Bancroft, Mr. Hoffman and Katharine Ross, who played Mrs. Robinson's daughter. The still photograph that appeared in advertisements for the film, showing Mrs. Robinson slowly peeling off a nylon stocking under the glazed gaze of Mr. Hoffman's Benjamin, became a classic of its kind.         Anna Maria Louisa Italiano was born on Sept. 17, 1931, in the Bronx to Italian immigrant parents. Her father, Michael, was a patternmaker, and her mother, Mildred, a telephone operator. By the time she was 2 years old she was learning to sing and dance. ''Why play with dolls,'' she recalled years later, ''when you can sing 'I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate' on the street corner?'' Even so, by the time she left high school she had decided to become a laboratory technician. Instead, her mother insisted that she attend the New York Academy of Dramatic Arts.         Two years later she found work in television where, as Anne Marno, she appeared in scores of dramatic shows. In 1951 she was asked to participate in another actor's screen test for 20th Century Fox, after which she, not he, was offered the contract that took her to Hollywood. At the studio she was handed a book of names and urged to choose a new one. She became Anne Bancroft. She had no illusions about that chapter of her film career, noting some years later that ''20th Century Fox told me what to do and I did it. I learned nothing.''         During her first stay in Hollywood she married Martin A. May, a building contractor, in 1954. They were divorced in 1957. In 1964 she married Mr. Brooks, who survives her, as does their son, Maximilian. Also surviving are her mother and two sisters, Joanne and Phyllis.         In the 1970's and 80's Ms. Bancroft took on a variety of roles, from Winston Churchill's American-born mother in ''Young Winston'' to the actress-wife of a hammy Polish impresario (''world famous in Poland''), played by Mr. Brooks, in the farcical ''To Be or Not to Be.'' She also earned two more Oscar nominations, one for her portrayal of a ballerina confronting her choice of career over family in ''The Turning Point,'' the other for her work as a mother superior in ''Agnes of God.'' Other major roles included '''Night Mother,'' as a woman struggling with her daughter's decision to commit suicide, and ''84 Charing Cross Road,'' in which she played an American writer whose correspondence with a London bookseller (Anthony Hopkins) develops into a long-distance romance.         She rarely returned to the theater, although she did win praise as the steel-willed Regina Giddens in Mr. Nichols's 1967 staging of Lillian Hellman's ''Little Foxes'' at Lincoln Center. In The Times, Clive Barnes characterized her performance as ''a series of unforgettable visual and aural images.'' The following year Ms. Bancroft appeared in the Lincoln Center Repertory production of another William Gibson drama, ''A Cry of Players,'' set in Shakespearean England. Her performance in ''Golda'' (1977) brought her a Tony nomination. She played a crippled violinist the 1981 ''Duet for One,'' which closed after a two-week run, and then was absent from the stage until the spring of 2002, when she was set to star in Edward Albee's ''Occupant'' as the sculptor Louise Nevelson. The play's scheduled run had to be canceled when Ms. Bancroft contracted pneumonia during previews.         In later years she continued to appear in films, although the roles grew smaller. She was briefly on screen as Nicolas Cage's mother in ''Honeymoon in Vegas,'' trained a young woman as an assassin in ''Point of No Return,'' scored a few points as a wily Senator in ''G.I. Jane'' and had some campy fun in an updated version of ''Great Expectations'' as a loony character based on Dickens's Miss Havisham.         She fared better in television, earning Emmy nominations playing a killer in the PBS drama ''Mrs. Cage'' and the title role in ''Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All'' on CBS.         She was resigned to the fact that age and changing times worked against her. In a 1992 interview in The Times she admitted to taking parts ''even if they're one page,'' because ''there are very few good scripts, even for Julia Roberts.'' She preferred a good bit part to a heftier bad one. She often rejected work in favor of family life -- for a while. ''I retire after every project,'' she once said. ''Then somehow there's always something that pulls me out of retirement.''         Correction:  June 18, 2005, Saturday  The obituary of the actress Anne Bancroft on June 8 misstated the name of the acting school she attended and omitted a major award. The school was the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, not the New York Academy. Ms. Bancroft won an Emmy in 1999 for best supporting actress in a mini-series, for the CBS drama ''Deep in My Heart.''       
         Geraldine Fitzgerald, a feisty, gravel-voiced Dublin redhead who drew instant acclaim in her first Hollywood films, including a 1939 Oscar nomination for ''Wuthering Heights,'' before carving out a long, varied career in films, television, cabaret and theater, died on Sunday afternoon at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 91.         She had Alzheimer's disease for more than a decade and was essentially incapacitated in recent years, leading to a respiratory infection that finally killed her, said her daughter, Susan Scheftel, a clinical psychologist in New York.         Ms. Fitzgerald appeared on the New York stage and as a highly coveted character actress in dozens of Hollywood films, including ''Watch on the Rhine'' in 1943, ''Ten North Frederick'' in 1958, ''The Pawnbroker'' in 1964, ''Harry and Tonto'' in 1974 and ''Arthur'' in 1981. But she may have been best known in New York for what many critics considered one of the definitive Mary Tyrones, opposite Robert Ryan, in a 1971 revival of Eugene O'Neill's ''Long Day's Journey Into Night.''         Witty and intelligent, she was also notoriously combative and blamed herself for sabotaging her early Hollywood success by battling with studio executives over roles. ''My mother was just way too feisty to be in bondage to the Warner Brothers,'' Ms. Scheftel said.         Born in 1913, the daughter of a Dublin solicitor, Geraldine Fitzgerald was drawn into the legendary Gate Theater by her aunt, Shelagh Richards, one of its stars. Ms. Fitzgerald performed there alongside James Mason and Orson Welles. She married Edward Lindsay-Hogg, an Irish aristocrat, and after a stint at art school in England she moved to New York in 1938 to further her husband's songwriting ambitions.         Money grew tight, and she noted that her old friend Welles was directing something called the Mercury Theater. She called and he hired her for a role in ''Heartbreak House.''         Norman Lloyd, a longtime friend and founding member of the Mercury Theater, described the effect she had. ''She was a staggeringly beautiful girl with the most delightful speech, a slight Irish tinge, not a thick brogue, and this glorious red hair,'' he said.         Hal Wallis, a major Hollywood producer, saw her in Shaw's ''Heartbreak House'' and signed her to a Warner Brothers contract. She was told to play best friend to the dying Bette Davis in ''Dark Victory'' (1939), and her performance persuaded Samuel Goldwyn to cast her as the tragic Isabella Linton in ''Wuthering Heights.''         In the 1940's she mingled with Hollywood's intellectual elite, counting among her friends Laurence Olivier, Charlie Chaplin, Davis, Welles and the screenwriter Charles Lederer.         When World War II separated Ms. Fitzgerald from her husband, then back in England, she stayed in Los Angeles with their son, Michael Lindsay-Hogg, later to become an acclaimed film, television and Broadway director. Her first marriage ended in 1946.         By then, she had worked her way up to leading roles. A performance as Woodrow Wilson's wife, Edith, in ''Wilson'' (1944) earned her a glamorous photo on the cover of Life magazine. It also attracted the attention of Stuart Scheftel, the grandson of Isador Straus, the co-owner of the R.H. Macy Co. who went down with the Titanic. Scheftel asked a friend to introduce them, and they were married in 1946.         They moved to New York and joined the rarefied circles in which the city's cultural and political worlds mingled. The couple stayed together until his death in 1994.         She continued to work steadily and in the 1960's formed the Everyman Street Theater, which ventured into the city's poorest neighborhoods to recruit and train street performers. This led to an interest in directing, and she staged several productions, including all-black productions of O'Neill classics. In 1982, she received her only Tony nomination, as a director, for ''Mass Appeal.'' Among the directors she aced out of a nomination that year was her son, who staged ''Agnes of God'' a couple of blocks away. He survives her, along with Ms. Scheftel, two grandchildren and one step-grandchild.         In the 1970's, after a small role in ''Rachel, Rachel'' required her to sing on camera, the unpleasant results caused her to take voice lessons. Thus she began yet another career, as a cabaret artist. Her show ''Streetsongs'' was a nightclub hit and appeared three times in Broadway theaters over the years.         When young actresses went to her for advice, she remembered her own regrets about having looked down her nose at early Hollywood offers. ''Her advice to young actresses was to always say yes,'' Ms. Scheftel said. ''She had learned that the hard way by saying no all the time. So she would tell them, when offered work, always say yes.''         Correction:  July 27, 2005, Wednesday  An obituary of the actress Geraldine Fitzgerald on July 19 misspelled the given name of the Macy's co-owner whose grandson she married. He was Isidor Straus, not Isador.       
         Franzi Groszmann, who was believed to be among the last survivors of the parents who put their London-bound children on trains to escape Nazi persecution, in the famed Kindertransport, died on Sept. 20 in Manhattan. She was 100.         Deborah Oppenheimer, producer of the 2000 movie ''Into the Arms of Strangers: Stories of the Kindertransport,'' announced the death.         Ms. Oppenheimer, whose own mother was a Kindertransport child, said she believed that Mrs. Groszmann was the last surviving mother who had placed a child (the author Lore Segal) on a train from Germany, Austria or Czechoslovakia to seek safety in Britain.         The British government had eased immigration restrictions for children under 17 after the violent attack on Jews in Germany in November 1938 known as Kristallnacht, or Night of the Broken Glass.         ''In no time, the suitcase was gone, the child was gone, the other children were gone -- just emptiness,'' Mrs. Groszmann said in the film about watching Lore board the train in Vienna. ''I did not talk. It was awful.''         She relaxed only after she received a postcard from Lore in England saying she was safe.         Ms. Segal told about the Kindertransport (Children's Transport) in her autobiographical novel, ''Other People's Houses,'' drawing a loving portrait of a charming and capable mother. From Dec. 2, 1938, until May 14, 1940, 9,000 to 10,000 children, 7,500 of them Jewish, were sent to Britain.         Each was allowed only one suitcase and one backpack, and was known only by a number. Lore was 152.         The mother and daughter also appeared in Melissa Hacker's Academy Award-winning 1996 film ''My Knees Were Jumping.''         Mrs. Groszmann's husband and Lore's father was Ignatz, the chief accountant of a Vienna bank, who was fired after Hitler took over Austria. At that time Lore was their only child.         In later years, when Lore thought of boarding the train, she had ''no clear recollection'' of her father's being there. She wrote, ''Every time I looked toward them it was my mother's tiny face . . . that I saw smiling steadily toward me.''         In England, Lore met the first of five foster families; with none of them would she feel comfortable. In an interview with The Jewish Week in 2001, she said her mother wrote her: ''Be good. Be obedient. Be neat. Be tidy. Always be nice.''         On the instructions her father gave her before leaving, Lore wrote the Jewish refugee committee asking it to get her parents out of Austria, as well as her grandparents, aunt and twin cousins. Her request was granted, and her parents and the others emigrated to England.         But they found work as domestic servants and could not have children living with them. . She did not live with her relatives again until after the war, when she joined them in the Dominican Republic at the age of 21.         For a time, her father was interned on the Isle of Man as a German-speaking alien. He died in the final week of the war after suffering a series of strokes. Mrs. Groszmann and her daughter lived in a small flat while Lore attended Bedford College in London.         Ms. Segal and her mother and grandmother immigrated to New York from the Dominican Republic in 1951 and lived together in a small apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Mrs. Groszmann worked as a salad cook at Schrafft's and as a sales clerk at a Washington Heights bakery. After helping Lore with her first baby, she trained herself to become a nurse.         In addition to Ms. Segal, Mrs. Groszmann is survived by her brother, Paul Stern, two grandchildren and two great-grandsons.         For many years, Mrs. Groszmann and Ms. Segal lived in different apartments in the same building on Riverside Drive in Manhattan. Each day at 7 a.m., the daughter would take the elevator down to have breakfast with her mother, who until three years ago rose at dawn to squeeze grapefruit juice for the two of them.       
         Betty Lee Hunt, a longtime Broadway and nightclub publicist and producer, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 85.         The cause was non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, said her partner, Maria Pucci. Among the many shows Ms. Hunt publicized were the original Broadway productions of ''Sweet Charity'' and ''Grease.''         She was an associate producer of ''Torch Song Trilogy,'' Harvey Fierstein's groundbreaking play, which won the 1983 Tony Award for best drama and Mr. Fierstein a Tony for best actor. She also co-produced the successful 1986 Off Broadway musical ''Beehive.''         Her extensive personal client roster at various times included Lena Horne, George Shearing, Marian McPartland and Bobby Short, with whom she worked for 35 years.         Born Betty Lee Hurewitz in Brooklyn, Ms. Hunt graduated from Erasmus Hall and began her career as an assistant to Dorothy Ross, a New York publicist for nightclubs like Spivy's Roof, Le Martinique and Le Ruban Bleu. In her early 20's she became publicity director for the Music Corporation of America, then worked for several other companies before forming Betty Lee Hunt Associates in 1950, which represented ''House of Flowers'' and ''The Zoo Story,'' the first of four Edward Albee plays she publicized.         The business was renamed Hunt/Pucci Associates three years after Ms. Pucci joined the company. Among the many shows they represented were Beth Henley's ''Crimes of the Heart,'' Marsha Norman's '''Night, Mother,'' Michael Cristofer's ''Shadow Box,'' John Pielmeier's ''Agnes of God,'' ''Liza Minnelli at the Winter Garden'' and Peter Allen's ''Up in One.''         In addition to Ms. Pucci, Ms. Hunt is survived by a sister, Aileen, and a brother, Saul.       
         Rona Jaffe, the preternaturally youthful writer whose 1958 novel ''The Best of Everything'' told the melodramatic story of four nubile, cashmere-sweatered career girls torn between storybook romance and cutthroat corporate Manhattan, died yesterday at University College Hospital in London, where she was on vacation. She was 74.         She died of cancer, said Alan C. Rothfeld, her lawyer and longtime friend.         Essentially commissioned by the movie producer Jerry Wald, Ms. Jaffe was a 25-year-old former associate editor in publishing when she sat down to write a book that Mr. Wald could turn into a blockbuster feature like ''Kitty Foyle: The Natural History of a Woman,'' a 1940 film that won Ginger Rogers an Academy Award for playing a plucky working girl who finds love, heartache, an unwanted pregnancy and, finally, romantic redemption. Published by Simon & Schuster, ''The Best of Everything,'' which drew on Ms. Jaffe's four-year employment at Fawcett Publications, as well as the experiences of close friends, was the urban answer to ''Peyton Place,'' Grace Metalious's risqué novel of lust in small-town America, which had been published two years earlier.         Ms. Jaffe's beautiful heroines -- Caroline, April, Barbara and Gregg -- toil as stenographers but are distracted by men, most of them cads, not to mention a lecherous boss called Mr. Shalimar. As Martin Levin of The New York Times wrote in a review of the book: ''Before very many coffee breaks one is a stretcher case, one is pregnant and the third is off to Las Vegas with a notorious lounge lizard. But that's the life of a working girl, at least as seen through Miss Jaffe's wide eyes.''         Critics howled, but America was entranced, which is precisely what its editor, Robert Gottlieb, was sure would happen. ''It was a basic story -- three or four or five girls start off together, one finds love, one goes crazy and/or dies, and one of them becomes a huge success -- but Rona's take was very up-to-date,'' Mr. Gottlieb said last night in a telephone interview. ''What made it work for the time was that it had a fresh young-career-women-in-New York quality with a fillip of shock.''         The synergy of its canny packaging as a book written expressly for Hollywood production was equally shocking at the time. Within two weeks of publication, the book was on the New York Times best-seller list, where it stayed for five months.         Less than a year later, thanks to Jerry Wald's involvement, ''The Best of Everything'' was released as a chic but heavy-handed film by 20th Century Fox and the director Jean Negulesco. The heroines' work site, Fabian Publishing, was set in the brand-new Seagram Building, and some of the sets were designed in seeming homage to a hot New York society decorator of the moment, Michael Greer. In a review of the movie's release on DVD last summer, Amy Nicholson of the Web site digsmagazine.com described its melodramatic, nail-biting charms as best accompanied by ''bonbons, chilled blush wine and possibly an emergency hanky.''         Hope Lange, Diane Baker, Martha Hyer and the 1950's supermodel Suzy Parker starred as the young women about town. Joan Crawford made a special appearance as Amanda Farrow, an ill-tempered book editor who, the film makes pointedly clear, has sacrificed personal happiness for professional glory. But it was Ms. Jaffe who went in a relative nobody and came back a star.         Born in 1931 in Brooklyn, Ms. Jaffe grew up in posh circumstances on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, the only child of Samuel Jaffe, an elementary-school principal, and his first wife, Diana, a high-strung socialite who had an independent fortune and a suburban estate in Connecticut. Her maternal grandfather was Moses Ginsberg, a millionaire construction magnate who built the Carlyle hotel.         Unlike her rather passive fictional characters, however, the tough-talking Ms. Jaffe was professionally ambitious and openly spoke of her desire to be a success. After graduating from the Dalton School at 15 and Radcliffe College four years later, she became a file clerk at Fawcett, eventually becoming an associate editor before leaving to write ''The Best of Everything.''         Like many of her characters, she had numerous romantic adventures, including a relationship with an Astor real estate heir. Ms. Jaffe did not, however, ever marry, preferring to avoid what she once dismissively described as ''the rat race to the altar.'' She leaves no survivors.         In the decades that followed ''The Best of Everything,'' Ms. Jaffe wrote 15 more popular books, several of which used the quartet-of-women narrative approach, including ''The Last Chance,'' a 1976 novel that one reviewer described as ''best devoured alone in bed, with a container of yogurt,'' and ''Class Reunion,'' a sudsy 1979 novel about three decades in the lives of four Radcliffe classmates, one of whom has a gay husband. Her last book was ''The Room-Mating Season,'' published in 2003. Mr. Gottlieb said he believed that her finest work was ''Mr. Right Is Dead,'' a 1965 collection of short stories and the title novella, about a call girl.         In her later years, Ms. Jaffe established herself as a patron of the arts. In 1995, she established the Rona Jaffe Foundation, which provides grants to emerging female writers. ''All writers need support, but many women in early career have fewer resources available to them and often many demands made upon them,'' Ms. Jaffe said in September at an awards ceremony. ''It gives me great pleasure to help some of them make their way at this early stage.''
