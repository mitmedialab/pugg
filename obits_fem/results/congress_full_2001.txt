         A'Lelia Nelson, a librarian who was a former president of a famous early black enterprise, the Madame C. J. Walker Manufacturing Company, died Jan. 20 at her home in Manhattan. She was 82. The cause was pancreatic cancer.         Ms. Nelson was linked to the company's founder, Madame C. J. Walker, who was her father's boss. Walker became a legend in the early 20th century by rising from poverty to become a millionaire, the first black American woman to do so. Her hair-straightening method and line of beauty products were sold by thousands of sales agents.         After Walker died in 1919, her daughter A'Lelia Walker took over the company. Her life was extravagant, and she ran a salon in Harlem called the Dark Tower that attracted celebrities like Langston Hughes.         A'Lelia Nelson's father, Freeman B. Ransom, was the company's general manager and lawyer during the years A'Lelia Walker was president, and named his daughter for her when she was born on Aug. 14, 1918. Her mother, Nettie Cox Ransom, was a teacher.         Miss Ransom entered Talladega College in Alabama at 16. After graduation, she got a master's degree in library science from Columbia University, where she was the only black person in her year of the program, said one daughter, the writer Jill Nelson.         She worked for a year in Waco, Tex., as a school librarian. In 1942, she became acquisitions supervisor for the Library of Congress in Washington, where she met Stanley Earl Nelson, then a student at Howard University's dentistry school.         They married in 1948 and moved to New York City. Ms. Nelson became vice president of Walker Manufacturing. In 1953, she became president. Walker's will decreed that the president must always be a woman. But the company was by then in decline. It was sold in the 1980's.         In 1968, Ms. Nelson worked on the ''Harlem on My Mind'' exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         From 1969 to 1996, she was a librarian at the City College of New York, where she compiled ''Black Spectrum: Bibliography of Black Studies Holdings in Cohen Library.'' She also organized a writers' festival named for Langston Hughes.         She was divorced in the 1970's. She is survived by two daughters, Jill and Lynn Nelson of New York; two sons, Stanley Earl Nelson Jr. of New York and Ralph Lewis Nelson of Berkeley, Calif.; and five grandchildren.       
         Sylvia Lawry, whose brother's incurable multiple sclerosis prompted her to found national and international organizations to fight the disease, died on Saturday at Bird S. Coler Hospital on Roosevelt Island. She was 85 and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Lawry founded both the National Multiple Sclerosis Society in the United States, in 1946, and the International Federation of Multiple Sclerosis Societies, in 1967. She was also one of the leaders of the effort to establish the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the National Institutes of Health, in 1950.         It all began with a classified advertisement in 1945 in which Ms. Lawry beseeched readers to write her of any cures for multiple sclerosis. Instead, she got more than 50 replies asking for the same thing. Her life's mission was the result.         Multiple sclerosis is a disease of the central nervous system. Its onslaught is signaled by sudden neurological symptoms, including loss of vision, paralysis, numbness and difficulties in walking, as nerves lose their sheathing and are unable to conduct signals.         Partly as a result of research financed by the societies started by Ms. Lawry, scientists now suspect that the disease may be caused by a viral infection on top of an inherited genetic susceptibility, though the specific triggering mechanism remains unknown.         The national society has also helped develop medicines to alleviate symptoms and prolong life expectancy, essentially offering a normal life span to many with multiple sclerosis. In 1890, when multiple sclerosis was treated with herbs and bed rest, life expectancy was five years.  But there is still no cure for the disease, which the society says strikes another adult each hour, leaving the most afflicted paralyzed.         ''Sylvia's uncompromising battle for more than a half century to solve the mystery of multiple sclerosis made her a hero to anyone touched by this devastating disease,'' said Richard Slifka, chairman of the society.         The national society credited her with the first use of the abbreviation M.S. for the disease. The Oxford English Dictionary cites as the first use of the term a 1955 article in Science News Letter discussing work by the society.         Sylvia Friedman was born in Brooklyn on June 28, 1915. Her father manufactured Venetian blinds. She graduated from Hunter College in 1936 and went to work in the office of her father's attorney as a receptionist. She hoped to go to law school and took a job in the United States attorney's office in Manhattan.         In 1944, she married Michael Lawry; they were divorced two years later. She used the last name Lawry for the rest of her life, though she married Stanley Englander, who was in the wholesale meat business, in 1957. He died in 1968.         When Ms. Lawry's brother, Bernard, was stricken with multiple sclerosis in 1945, she and her sister Alice placed a classified advertisement in The New York Times: ''Multiple sclerosis. Will anyone recovered from it please communicate with patient. T272 Times.''         The sisters received 54 replies from people as desperate as they were. Most asked to be informed if the two heard anything promising.         ''I was looking for medical clues that might have helped my brother,'' Ms. Lawry said in an interview with The New York Post in 1959. ''But when the responses started to snowball and come from all over the country, I decided to give up the law and let my creative energies spill over into helping M.S. victims.''         Starting with family and friends, Ms. Lawry built a network. Her sister Alice helped. Her other sister, Lillian, and her husband, Stanley Wilson, founded one of the first local chapters, in the Bronx.         Ms. Lawry is survived by Lillian Wilson, who lives in Spring Valley, N.Y.; two sons, Frank Englander of Manhattan, and Steven Englander of Montgomery, N.Y., and two grandchildren.         The fight against multiple sclerosis grew. A tiny office was found. The doctors whom Ms. Lawry first consulted about her brother became interested in the effort.         Dee Sammak, the accounts payable manager who has worked for the society since 1954, said she has stayed all these years because of the inspiration of Ms. Lawry. ''Don't forget,'' Ms. Sammak said, ''when she started the society, women were not doing these things -- to start a society in a man's world.''         On March 11, 1946, Ms. Lawry assembled 20 prominent research scientists to found the Association for Advancement of Research in Multiple Sclerosis, which was renamed the National Multiple Sclerosis Society in 1947. Its first research grant went toward studying the relationship between the body's immune system and the effects of multiple sclerosis on the central nervous system.         Though her brother's health progressively weakened until his death in 1973, the organization Ms. Lawry founded gathered momentum. In 1950, she teamed up with Senator Charles Tobey of New Hampshire, whose daughter had multiple sclerosis, to lobby Congress for what is now the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.         The law creating the institute passed on Aug. 15, 1950. At that time, total federal appropriations for research on multiple sclerosis were $14,000. They now total $100 million a year, the society said.         Ms. Lawry's political skills were evident throughout her career. A frequent tactic, she told CNN in 1995, was to lobby people who had relatives or acquaintances with the disease. She mentioned winning support from President John F. Kennedy, who had a cousin with the disease, and Grace Kelly, whose first fiancé had it.         The international organization was born after the national society realized it was giving almost one-third of its research grants to foreigners. There are now 38 societies around the world.         Ms. Lawry, who worked 12-hour days, said she would never retire until multiple sclerosis retired. The disease still affects 1 in 1,000 people in the United States.         ''There was a continuing pain in her heart, because what she really wanted to see was M.S. go the way of polio,'' said Arney Rosenblat, a society spokeswoman.       
         Marjorie Hunter, a reporter for The New York Times who covered the White House and Congress at a time when most other women in Washington journalism were assigned to the activities of the first lady, died here today. She was 78.         The cause was acute leukemia.         Journalism was almost completely a male bastion here until Eleanor Roosevelt started holding press conferences every other Tuesday in the 1930's and decreed that only women could attend.         The Times at first resisted assigning a woman to its Washington bureau and instead sent a reporter from New York to the White House each time that Mrs. Roosevelt held a press conference.         In time, that reporter left the paper and Ms. Hunter -- Maggie to everyone from copy boys to presidents -- was hired in 1961 as her replacement.         But Ms. Hunter, who had covered the Legislature in North Carolina and had an affinity for politicians, soon tired of news of the first lady and persuaded her boss, James Reston, to assign her to cover Congress and other government news.         In ''The Girls in the Balcony,'' (Random House, 1992) Nan Robertson, a former reporter for The Times, wrote of the obstacles that women in Washington journalism faced in the 1960's. The balcony in the title referred to the perch above the auditorium of the National Press Club, which did not allow women on the floor and barred them from membership.         ''Maggie Hunter recalled the day she started a little mutiny at The New York Times bureau because of the balcony,'' Ms. Robertson wrote. ''Scotty Reston, then the bureau chief, had sent her off to the club to cover a speech by Madame Nhu, the beautiful and sinister female leader of South Vietnam, the wife of Ngo Dinh Nhu.         ''Now, Maggie, a Southern lady and a thorough professional, was no feminist firebrand. That day, however, 'I stood on a rolled-up carpet in the back of the balcony and I couldn't hear a goddamned word going on down there -- I couldn't hear a word.'         ''Afterwards, she marched, fuming into Reston's office. She blurted out, 'Scotty, don't you ever send me to that damned National Press Club ever again.'         ''Reston turned to Wallace Carroll, the bureau's news editor, who had befriended Maggie at The Winston-Salem Journal in North Carolina and had brought her to The Times. 'Wally,' said Reston slowly, with an air of innocent wonderment, 'what's wrong with Maggie?'         '''I don't think,' she said years later, 'that Scotty ever understood why I was so mad.' ''         Ms. Hunter was born June 2, 1922, in Bethany, W.Va., and grew up on the campus of Elon College in North Carolina, where her father, Joshua A. Hunter, was a professor and her mother, Minna, taught in the local school system.         She was managing editor of the Elon College newspaper while a student and was also a correspondent for the local paper, The Burlington Times-News. She graduated from Elon in 1942 and then worked as a reporter for The Raleigh News and Observer, The Houston Press and The Winston-Salem Journal.         She retired from the Times in 1986.         Ms. Hunter is survived by a niece, Susie Frye of Hickory, N.C., and a nephew, Thomas Walker of Richmond, Va.         In 1969, Ms. Hunter was elected president of the Women's National Press Club. Its name was changed to the Washington Press Club when it started admitting men. The National Press Club finally admitted women in 1971 and the two clubs were merged in 1985.         Ms. Hunter was inducted into the North Carolina Journalism, Advertising and Public Relations Hall of Fame in 1992. Her citation said:         ''A firm believer in the watchdog function of the press, Hunter gained notoriety for a 1955 incident in which she challenged the Appropriations Committee's right to convene in closed session and had to be carried from the room while still sitting in her chair.''       
         Helen Oakley Dance, a journalist and historian of jazz and blues, as well as a record producer, music publisher and personal assistant to musicians like Duke Ellington, Red Norvo, Chick Webb, Johnny Hodges, Bob Crosby and Earl Hines, died on Sunday in Escondido, Calif. She was 88.         Ms. Dance -- who often worked  with her husband, the jazz historian and record producer Stanley Dance -- began as a pioneering female jazz critic in the 1930's but soon began to play a role in exposing a wider American audience to jazz. She insisted on taking the music seriously, and from the start, as a habitué of the swing ballrooms, she distinguished herself from the jitterbuggers by watching from the sidelines.         During that decade, she wrote jazz reviews for Downbeat and other publications, worked for the management organizations of Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong and promoted and booked Chick Webb's touring band. She also produced records for the Okeh label and organized the well-promoted swing-band battles at the Savoy Ballroom in New York, which became legendary events.         In 1935, as head of the Chicago Rhythm Club, a fan organization that  booked concerts, she persuaded Benny Goodman to hire the pianist Teddy Wilson, and to bring Goodman's group to play in April 1936 at the  Congress Hotel in Chicago. The event broke ground because it featured an interracial band and because it was one of the earliest American presentations of jazz in a sit-down performance hall. And while working for Irving Mills, Ellington's manager, she sold him on the idea of forming small bands within Ellington's larger orchestra. She soon become the head of artists and repertory for Variety records, which issued a series of recordings by these small bands.         Born in Toronto to a well-to-do family, Ms. Dance attended Ovenden and Trinity Colleges in Toronto and a finishing school in Lausanne, Switzerland. In the early 1930's she traveled to London, where she first saw  Ellington perform. Soon after, she rebelled against her family by moving to Detroit, where she intended to work as a jazz singer and later met  Ellington by forging an introductory note to him from a jazz critic. But by 1934 she moved to Chicago and found work writing about and helping to produce jazz concerts. She became a regular contributor to the new Downbeat magazine and was one of the organizers of the famous 1937 Goodman concert at Carnegie Hall.         In 1942 she volunteered for the Women's Army Corps and was assigned to Algiers, where she sent undercover operatives and radio technicians to occupied zones. Later in the war she trained renegade German soldiers as American spies.         Soon after the war she married Mr. Dance, whom she originally met while working for Mills, and they began their 50-year collaboration on  articles, histories and record productions. The family moved to Rowayton, Conn., and from 1964 to 1982, while her husband managed Hines, Ms. Dance ran Hicue, the music publishing company for Hines and Hodges. She also conducted interviews with jazz musicians for the Smithsonian Institution and Rutgers University. In 1971 she wrote ''Stormy Monday'' (Lightning Press), a biography of the blues musician Aaron (T-Bone) Walker.         Ms. Dance also worked in the civil rights movement, founding the Catholic Interracial Council within the Roman Catholic diocese of Bridgeport, Conn., and the Human Relations Commission in Norwalk, Conn.         In 1988 the Helen Oakley Dance and Stanley Dance Archive was established at Yale University, encompassing correspondence, writings, interviews, records, photographs and films; it will become available to researchers later this year. An oral history interview with Ms. Dance, conducted by Patricia Willard, a jazz historian, is part of the Ellington Collection at the National Museum of American History in Washington.         Mr. Dance died in February 1999.         Ms. Dance is survived by sons  Francis, of Woodbury, Conn., and Rupert, of Hopkinton, N.H.; daughters Theresa Bennink-Dance of Peterborough, Ontario, and Maria Lindley of Carlsbad, Calif.; sisters Jacqueline Hickson of New Smyrna Beach, Fla., and Doris Barry of Wilton, Conn.;  brother John Gillespie of Toronto; and three grandchildren.         ''The affinity with jazz which has determined my life was not inherited,'' she told the writer Sally Placksin in the book ''Jazzwomen.'' ''It was a gift. For the record, I was never really career-minded. My priorities were reversed, because I wasn't that hungry for gold. All my feel was for the music and the people who played things you wanted to hear.''       
         Gale Cincotta, a plainspoken mother of six who became a neighborhood activist and went on to help ignite the national debate over bank lending policies that discriminated against minority home buyers, died Wednesday at a hospital in Maywood, Ill. She was 72.         The cause was gall bladder cancer, said Tracy Van Slyke, spokeswoman for the National Training and Information Center, of which Ms. Cincotta was executive director.         Ms. Cincotta, who lived in Oak Park, a Chicago suburb, achieved fame for her spirited fights for residents of the neighborhood of Austin, on Chicago's West Side, where she lived most of her life. In a 1996 article in Illinois Issues, she told of nailing a rat to the door of the alderman for  Austin in 1970 after he refused to attack rodents. The next day, the city's rat patrol was on the job.         She moved on to national issues, especially her challenge to the banking industry and the federal bureaucracy over the practice called redlining, refusing to lend to residents of minority neighborhoods. As part of this fight, she once threatened to nail a ''Loan Shark'' sign over the door of the Federal Reserve in Washington.         After redlining was outlawed in the 1970's, she kept fighting to make sure the law was enforced.         Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago said she ''was instrumental in helping the city formulate its campaign against predatory lending.''         Last year, she successfully lobbied for a Chicago ordinance to ban such lending practices, like offering very high mortgage rates and other confiscatory financial terms to minority members and the poor, often resulting in the loss of homes through foreclosures. In April, the Illinois Legislature followed suit.         Gail Angeles was born on Dec. 28, 1929, in Chicago. Her father ran a Greek restaurant. She married a gas station owner and they had six sons. She became politically active in the 1960's because of school crowding.         In the late 1960's, Ms. Cincotta became president of the Organization for a Better Austin. The school battle expanded into other concerns, as Ms. Cincotta fought real estate agents' encouragement of panic selling by white homeowners as minorities began looking for homes.         People in other cities began turning to Ms. Cincotta and her colleagues for advice, and she became head of National People's Action, a network of 30 groups from 110 cities. The umbrella group held a housing conference in Chicago in 1972 and a protest in Baltimore the next year.         The strategy was extended to other issues, including consumer protection. ''Coalitions are forming all over the place,'' Ms. Cincotta said in an interview with The New York Times in 1982.         Her group was one of those that successfully pressed Congress to pass the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, which requires lending institutions to disclose where they make home loans. It also was an advocate in the winning fight to persuade Congress to pass the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which required banks to invest in neighborhoods where they did business.         National People's Action combined with other neighborhood groups to persuade three large Chicago banks to commit themselves to making $173 million in low-interest loans for housing and industrial development in poor neighborhoods. In return, the groups agreed not to challenge the banks' merger plans.         Colleagues remembered her war cry: ''We want it. They've got it. Let's go get it.''         Ms. Cincotta is survived by five sons, George and Charles of Delray Beach, Fla.; James of Ottawa, Canada; Theodore of Phoenix and Richard of Oak Park, Ill., eight grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.  No information was available on the sixth son.
