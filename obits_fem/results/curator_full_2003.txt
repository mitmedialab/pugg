         Dorothy Miller, one of the first curators hired by the Museum of Modern Art, in 1934, and the woman responsible for pioneering exhibitions of new American artists that helped propel generations of painters like Pollock, Rothko, Frank Stella and Jasper Johns onto the international scene, died yesterday at her apartment in Greenwich Village. She was 99.         Ms. Miller was a clairvoyant curator with unusually wide-ranging tastes. Her career began when American modernists like Stuart Davis were still young and lasted into the early heyday of Mr. Stella, Ellsworth Kelly, James Rosenquist and Claes Oldenburg. She included Mr. Oldenburg and Mr. Rosenquist in the last of her ''Americans'' exhibitions, in 1963.         The ''Americans'' shows began in 1942 with a selection of what were then mostly unknown artists of eclectic styles from across the country. The format was to have a select group of artists, abstract and figurative, each presented in some depth. The slender catalogs had statements by the artists. Typically, Ms. Miller wanted them to speak for themselves rather than presuming to speak for them.         She was invariably a step ahead of public taste. The 1942 show was panned. The museum's trustees were appalled. Some threatened to quit. Even Alfred H. Barr Jr., the Modern's visionary director, who otherwise supported Ms. Miller, quietly tried to distance himself from it.         Ms. Miller would organize her ''Americans'' shows at the last minute, to remain perfectly up to date and to keep secret the names of the artists until just before the opening. ''Congratulations, Dorothy,'' Barr told her after one opening. ''You've done it again. They all hate it.''         But over time, many of the artists she discovered came to be admired. ''I was fortunate to have two brilliant guides,'' she said, modestly, ''Alfred H. Barr Jr. and my husband, Holger Cahill.''         Dorothy Canning Miller was born on Feb. 6, 1904, in Hopedale, Mass., and was reared in Montclair, N.J. After graduating from Smith College in 1925, she enrolled in the Newark Museum apprentice program and was hired at the museum in 1926. There she met Mr. Cahill, a curator, with whom she worked on exhibitions of progressive American art that caught Mr. Barr's attention. He hired her. When Mr. Cahill was appointed director of the W.P.A. Federal Art Project in Washington in 1935, he asked Ms. Miller to join him. She declined, saying she had landed the ''best job in the museum world'' at the Modern.         Her first show there was about W.P.A. art. After she organized ''Americans 1942,'' she put together ''American Realists and Magic Realists'' in 1943, ''Fourteen Americans'' in 1946, ''Fifteen Americans'' in 1952, ''Twelve Americans'' in 1956, ''Sixteen Americans'' in 1959 and her last ''Americans'' show in 1963. The 1946 show included Gorky, Isamu Noguchi and Robert Motherwell; the 1952 show had Pollock, Rothko and Clyfford Still; the 1956 show introduced Larry Rivers and Grace Hartigan to a wide public; the 1959 show had Mr. Stella, Louise Nevelson, Jay de Feo, Robert Rauschenberg and Mr. Johns. The 1963 show, besides Mr. Oldenburg and Mr. Kelly, featured Cryssa, Lee Bontecou, Richard Lindner and Robert Indiana. Reviewing it in The New York Times, John Canaday said it answered ''the 30-year-old question of what ever happened to vaudeville. It moved to the Museum of Modern Art.''         The most influential exhibition that Ms. Miller organized was surely ''The New American Painting,'' which toured Europe in 1958 and 1959.         It significantly changed European perceptions of American art, putting Abstract Expressionism on the map there once and for all.         In 1969 Ms. Miller retired from the Modern and became an adviser to various corporate collections and, with Eleanor Price Mather, was co-author of ''Edward Hicks: His Peaceable Kingdom and Other Paintings,'' about the early 19th-century American folk artist. She is survived by a stepdaughter, Jane Cahill Blumenfeld of Albuquerque, N.M.; a niece, Edith White Danton of Osterville, Mass.; and a nephew, Reid White of Lenox, Mass.         Russell Lynes, in his history of the Modern, said Ms. Miller was ''looked upon by artists either as a benign goddess or as a disdainful one, depending on whether or not she smiled on their work.''         Mr. Stella said yesterday: ''She was a straight shooter, very respectful of the art and the artists and the museum, something you don't get that much of anymore. The 'Americans' shows set the tone for my time. You were either in or you were not. They were exhibitions of what was going on, pointing to the future, and they were definitive. Or if they weren't definitive, they were certainly exciting.''       
         Judith Arango Henderson, a design expert, curator and columnist whose Miami retail store, Arango Inc., was one of the first to specialize in midcentury modern design, died on July 12 in Piedmont, Calif. She was 75 and lived there and in Miami.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, her family said.         The store, opened in 1959 and still in operation, brought an appreciation for simple, functional design to a city famous for fanciful ornamentation. It sells flatware, glassware, furniture and other household items, many by modernists like Alvar Aalto and Arne Jacobsen, all designed for aesthetic appeal as well as utility. The store also presented exhibitions devoted to designers, materials, manufacturers and design trends.         Ms. Arango was acknowledged to have influenced generations of designers and architects in Miami. In 1981, she expanded her exhibition program by establishing the Arango Design Foundation.         Its shows, which traveled to other cities, included ''Out of the Ordinary,'' a look at well-designed and commonly available objects like paintbrushes, padlocks and a scissors to remove the tops of soft-boiled eggs, and ''Re(f)use,'' devoted to products made from recycled materials.         Ms. Arango was also a contributor to design publications like Abitare and Domus, and she wrote a ''Design of the Month'' column for The San Francisco Chronicle. The column, which reviewed everyday items like mops and coffee makers, appeared through this summer.         Ms. Arango, whose maiden name was Wolpert, was born on July 1, 1928, in Miami, where her father owned a conventional furniture store. After graduating from Wellesley with a degree in philosophy, she worked for the United States Information Service in Bogotá, Colombia.         Ms. Arango's first marriage ended in divorce. She is survived by her husband, John B. Henderson of Piedmont and Miami; her children from her first marriage, Richard Arango of Miami and Virginia Arango of Raleigh, N.C.; a sister, Carol Jane Gottfried of Miami; a brother, Jordan Dancer of Scottsdale, Ariz.; and two grandchildren.       
         Clare Le Corbeiller, a longtime curator of the decorative arts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 71.         She had battled cancer for five years, said her husband, Jean Le Corbeiller.         Mrs. Corbeiller was widely knowledgeable in the decorative arts, specializing in Continental porcelain, metalwork and jewelry (with emphasis on 18th-century French) and Chinese export porcelain. She was also what might be called an old-school curator in that she was trained primarily through direct contact with objects, although she attended lectures in art history by Seymour Slive and Wolfgang Stechow during two years spent studying piano at Oberlin College.         Mrs. Le Corbeiller was born of American parents in 1931 in Cambridge, England, where her father was studying history. She grew up in Cleveland and in New York, where her mother worked at the Museum of Modern Art and as an editor at Lincoln Kirstein's magazine Dance Index.         Mrs. Le Corbeiller came to the Met as a summer volunteer in 1952 while studying advertising design at the Rhode Island School of Design. Except for a six-year absence in the early 1960's, when her two daughters were in the sandbox stage, she never left. She joined the museum's central cataloging department in 1953 and when that department was dissolved in 1959 -- an event that she saw as unfortunate -- she moved to the decorative arts department, known today as European Sculpture and Decorative Arts.         Mrs. Le Corbeiller's career both paralleled and contributed to the rise in prominence of the Met's European decorative arts holdings during the last 35 years. She was involved at all levels, micro to macro.         She systematized both the department's storage and its files, oversaw the installation of permanent galleries and period rooms, contributed to major exhibitions like ''The Arts Under Napoleon'' (1978) and guided acquisitions. With James Parker, she wrote the guide to the museum's Wrightsman Galleries (1979), the complex of spaces that display Jane Wrightsman's immense gift of French decorative arts; she also wrote the catalog for the gold boxes included in the gift (1977). She selected the porcelains for the museum's Jack and Belle Linsky Collection and also wrote its catalog (1984). With Alice Cooney Frelinghuysen she organized ''Chinese Export Porcelain'' at the Met in 2003 and wrote its catalog, published as the Winter 2003 issue of the museum's bulletin.         In addition, Mrs. Le Corbeiller published regularly in magazines like Apollo and taught in the Parsons/Cooper-Hewitt master's program and the Bard Graduate Center.         After her child-rearing hiatus, during which she wrote a book on American and European snuffboxes, Mrs. Le Corbeiller returned to the Met as an assistant curator in 1967, rising to full curator in 1991. She was named curator emerita upon her retirement in 2000. In her honor, the Met turned an issue of its annual Journal into a 319-page Festschrift; it contained essays by 28 colleagues from the museum and elsewhere, an in-house record in terms of contributors.         In addition to her husband, a teacher of mathematics and the history of science whom she married in 1958, Mrs. Le Corbeiller is survived two daughters, Suzanne Le Corbeiller of Pocatello, Idaho, and Geneviéve White of Pelham, N.Y., and four grandchildren.         Correction:  December 1, 2003, Monday  An obituary last Monday about Clare Le Corbeiller, a longtime curator of decorative arts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, misspelled the given name of a donor of French decorative works. She is Jayne Wrightsman, not Jane.
