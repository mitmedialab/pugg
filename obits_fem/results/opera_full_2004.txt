         Vestal Goodman, a matriarch of gospel music whose influence ranged far beyond its traditional audience, died on Saturday in Celebration, Fla. She was 74.         The Associated Press reported her death based on information from funeral home officials and her own Web site. The cause was not given.         Mrs. Goodman and her husband, Howard Goodman, known as Happy, who died last year at 81, were cofounders of the Happy Goodman Family act. Friends said Mrs. Goodman never really recovered from her husband's death.         The Happy Goodman Family, whose enthusiastic and inspirational live performances recalled early camp-meeting evangelism, formed in 1949 and was on the road constantly for 50 years. They often appeared as part of Billy Graham Crusades.         The Happy Goodman Family recorded 15 No. 1 gospel hits and played more than 3,500 concerts. The family was inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 1998.         Mrs. Goodman, who dreamed of being an opera star as a girl, brought operatic flourishes to gospel. She never forsook her signature beehive hairstyle, her floor-length beaded gowns or the white handkerchief she carried in her right hand. Fans often waved their own handkerchiefs back.         The family's music revived in popularity in the 1990's, taking its place beside the younger contemporary Christian musicians and groups.         In the 1980's, the Goodmans were featured on the ''PTL Club'' television show of Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker. They left the program in 1988, and were not linked to scandals involving the Bakkers.         The Happy Goodman Family also often featured Happy's brothers Rusty and Sam.         They were an inspiration to the current gospel great Bill Gaither, who included the Goodmans in more than 60 of his Gaither Homecoming videos, a popular series that was a precursor of music videos. Mrs. Goodman was featured on the current Gaither Homecoming tour and had been booked to continue with the tour into 2004. Her autobiography, ''Vestal!,'' was published in 1998.         The troubled country star George Jones told The Tennessean newspaper in 2002 that after he was nearly killed a few years ago in a drunk-driving accident north of Nashville, he sent for Mrs. Goodman, who came to pray with him in the hospital and became a spiritual mentor.         Mrs. Goodman is survived by a son, Rick; a daughter, Vicki; four grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.       
         Elma Lewis, a nationally recognized arts educator who was among the first people to be awarded a MacArthur Fellowship, died on Jan. 1 at her home in Roxbury, the Boston neighborhood. She was 82.         The cause was complications of diabetes, said Sarah-Ann Shaw, a former student.         Ms. Lewis, considered a doyenne of black culture in Boston, was a no-nonsense mentor to generations of young dance, opera and theater students at the Elma Lewis School of Fine Arts, which she founded in 1950 in a Roxbury apartment before moving it permanently to a former synagogue and school in the same area. In 1968 she founded the National Center of Afro-American Artists, which still exists although the school closed in 1986. In addition to becoming a MacArthur Fellow, she received a national medal for the arts in 1983.         She operated the Elma Lewis Playhouse in the Park, a summer theater where musicians played to capacity audiences in Franklin Park in Roxbury, after she had overseen an effort to rid the area of drug dealers and garbage. Duke Ellington and the Boston Pops Orchestra, under Arthur Fiedler, were among the performers there.         Born in Roxbury, Ms. Lewis worked her way through Emerson College by acting. She received a master's degree in education from Boston University, and staged operas and taught speech therapy, dance and drama in Boston and Cambridge, Mass.         She had no immediate survivors.         Asked in an 1981 interview in The Times if she felt like a token as one of three women among 21 MacArthur fellows, Ms. Lewis said that she had felt exclusion more because of her race than because of her sex. ''As a matter of fact,'' she said, ''women's problems belong to white women, because it is in that white dominant group that men are keeping women from utmost dominance. The black man is oppressed, and I can't imagine a man brave enough to oppress me.''       
         Fraydele Oysher, a star of the Yiddish theater and a member of a musical dynasty, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan, said her daughter, the singer and comedian Marilyn Michaels. She was 90.         The daughter of a cantor, Ms. Oysher began her career as a child actress in the Yiddish theaters that once dotted Second Avenue on the Lower East Side. She starred in musicals written for her, including ''The Little Queen,'' ''The Golden Girl'' and ''Fraydele's Wedding.''         She also specialized in one of the Yiddish theater's staple roles: the Yeshiva boy who -- it is revealed in the final, showstopping number -- is really a girl.         ''I was cute, I was flat and I was a terrific piece of work,'' she explained in a 1996 interview with The Daily News.         As an adult, she became one of the first women to sing cantorial music onstage, long before women were allowed to assume that role in Reform and Conservative synagogues. She also toured the United States, South America and Cuba, performing folk songs, theater songs and liturgical chants with her husband, Harold Sternberg.         Mr. Sternberg, who appeared on Broadway in a number of George Gershwin's shows, was also a basso profundo in the Metropolitan Opera chorus for 40 years.         Ms. Oysher's brother, Moishe, was a major star in Yiddish theater and films and a cantor known as ''the master singer of his people.''         Fraydele Oysher was born on Oct. 3, 1913, in Lipkon, Bessarabia, which was then a Russian province. (It is now part of Moldova.)         In addition to Ms. Michaels, who lives in Manhattan, Ms. Oysher is survived by her son, Michael Sternberg, also of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.       
         Uta Hagen, the formidable and wide-ranging stage actress who electrified audiences with her Tony Award-winning performance as the ferocious, tart-tongued Martha in the original Broadway production of Edward Albee's ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' in 1962, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan, her daughter, Leticia Ferrer, said. She was 84.         Over seven decades, Ms. Hagen acted in Shakespeare, Chekhov and Shaw, as well as in plays by Mr. Albee and Tennessee Williams. With her husband Herbert Berghof (who died in 1990), she ran the HB Studios in Manhattan and was celebrated not only as an actress but also as a teacher of acting and author of books on the subject. She continued to teach after a stroke and until several months before her death. Occasionally she appeared in films and on television, but principally her life was onstage, and it was there that she was able to incarnate the widest diversity of characters.         Ms. Hagen made her professional debut in 1937 playing Ophelia to Eva Le Gallienne's Hamlet, and was acclaimed for her Nina (in ''The Seagull''), Desdemona (opposite Paul Robeson's Othello), Shaw's St. Joan, Blanche DuBois in ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' and as the title character in ''The Country Girl'' by Clifford Odets. Mr. Albee's Martha became her signature role.         It was a long journey from Ophelia to Martha, but one that she traveled with an unmatchable authority and an intuitive sense of character. Whether she was playing a saint or a termagant, she anchored each role with a firm base in reality. Despite her onstage strength, she said she always considered herself ''a vulnerable actress.'' Once asked what qualities an actress needed to play Martha, Ms. Hagen said, ''Intelligence, voluptuousness and hypersensitivity,'' and then added, ''wit'' -- all of which she had in abundance.         In a recent interview, Mr. Albee recalled her ''extraordinary performances as Desdemona in 'Othello' and Martha in 'Virginia Woolf,' '' and praised Ms. Hagen first as ''a profoundly truthful actress'' and then as ''a dedicated and demanding teacher.''         ''I should add,'' he said, ''she was a great anti-hypocrite, and a superb cook -- not a bad friend to have.''         In 1999, she called her whole goal as an actress ''the spontaneity that comes without planning.'' Whenever possible, she uncovered the drama behind the comedy -- or the comedy behind the drama. As she said, ''Somebody with wit and a sense of humor sees the most tragic event without the sentimentality, sees in any life experience something ludicrous -- which is probably why Chekhov is my favorite.''         She believed a performance should change in the course of the run, depending on the identity of the other actors, the audience response and the actress's mood and temperament. She played Blanche opposite Marlon Brando, Anthony Quinn (her favorite), Ralph Meeker, Richard Kiley and Jack Palance. ''If you go on with another actor and your performance doesn't change, you're a bad actor.''         In contrast to many other actors, she loved long runs: ''After a couple of months,'' she said, ''it really starts to get in my bones.'' On keeping a part alive, she called Laurette Taylor her guide. She saw her play Amanda in ''The Glass Menagerie'' 10 times, saying, ''Ten different exciting performances -- to me, that is the magic of the theater.''         Uta Hagen was born in Göttingen, Germany, on June 12, 1919. Her father named her after a 13th-century statue he saw in a Nuremburg cathedral. When Uta was 7, the family moved to Madison, Wis., where her father was head of the department of art history at the University of Wisconsin (her mother was an opera singer). From the age of 6, when she saw Elisabeth Bergner play Shaw's ''St. Joan'' in Berlin, she wanted to be an actress. She studied briefly at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, and at the University of Wisconsin, and left college -- and left home -- to pursue an acting career.         In 1937, Le Gallienne was preparing to play Hamlet in a production in Dennis, Mass., and was having difficulty finding an Ophelia. Ms. Hagen sent a letter requesting an audition. As Le Gallienne recalled in her autobiography, her impulse was to refuse, but something in the letter encouraged her to invite the young actress to audition.         ''She was very young -- only just 17 -- a tall, rather gawky creature, by no means pretty, but with a face that one remembered,'' Le Gallienne wrote, adding she had ''the shy ungainly grace of a young colt.'' For her audition, Ms. Hagen acted the end of the trial scene from ''St. Joan,'' ''quite badly,'' Le Gallienne said, ''and yet I sensed in her an inner truth that very occasionally filtered through in a word or a look.'' She told her to go and think about the role and return in an hour.         ''The improvement was startling,'' Le Gallienne said, ''The truth that had glimmered so faintly in the first reading now blazed up strongly, and the overall effect was strangely moving.'' She cast her.         In the dress rehearsal, she said, ''the sacred fire struck, and the child Uta was transported to a region which I well knew she would not set foot in again for many years to come.'' And so, just 18, Ms. Hagen made her professional debut as Ophelia, an Ophelia that was several inches taller than Hamlet.         She then joined Le Gallienne's theater company, which was preparing a production of ''The Seagull.'' The director was playing the role of Nina, with Ms. Hagen as her understudy. That production never came to fruition, but soon Ms. Hagen heard that Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne were about to do it on Broadway.         At the audition, Lunt told her to do something simple, not classical and nothing from ''The Seagull.'' She had planned to do the last scene from ''A Doll's House,'' but at the last minute decided to do Nina anyway. ''I played the whole last scene as Nina alone, without a Konstantin present,'' she recalled, ''and I came offstage in a daze.'' As she headed out the stage door, she was called back, and Lunt (who was playing Trigorin) rehearsed with her long into the night, and then told her she had the part. Ms. Hagen's Broadway debut came the next year as Nina in Lunt and Fontanne's ''Seagull.'' In his review in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson singled her out for praise as ''grace and aspiration incarnate.''         That summer, working in Ridgefield, Conn., she acted in ''The Latitude of Love,'' opposite José Ferrer. In the course of the play, she was required to knock him down. Several months later they were married. During their 10-year marriage, they appeared together in several plays, including ''Angel Street.''         Ms. Hagen is survived by their daughter, Leticia, known as Lettie, of New York City; a granddaughter; and a great-granddaughter.         Ms. Hagen said she considered the period between 1938 and 1947 as ''the transitional years of my career, during which I lost my way and a love of acting until I finally regained it to begin a true life in the theater.'' During that time, she acted in seven Broadway plays, including ''Key Largo'' (with Paul Muni) and ''Othello'' (with Robeson as Othello and Ferrer as Iago). The turning point, she said, was in 1947 when Harold Clurman directed her in ''The Whole World Over.'' The play was forgettable, but she greatly admired Clurman as a director and teacher, and it was in that play that she met Berghof, who replaced another actor in the company.         Having divorced Ferrer, she married Berghof and the two dedicated themselves to teaching actors in their HB Studio, on Bank Street in Greenwich Village. In subsequent years, teaching young actors became as important to her as her own acting. In one of her books, ''A Challenge for the Actor,'' she disagreed with Shaw's pronouncement ''He who can does. He who cannot teaches.'' For her, ''Only he who can should teach.''         In 1948, she led the national company of ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' and then followed Jessica Tandy in the role on Broadway. In 1950 she played the title role in ''The Country Girl.'' For that performance, she won her first Tony.         The next year, she finally played St. Joan, in Margaret Webster's production. Always outspoken about politics and human rights, Ms. Hagen was blacklisted in the 1950's, and, she said, ''that fact kept me pure.'' Unable to work in the movies or on television or to tour plays through the United States, she continued to focus her attentions on New York theater. She was a member of the Phoenix Theater, but her acting became more sporadic.         Then, in 1962, the call came to return to the stage. The producer Richard Barr and his partners were bringing a new play by a new playwright to Broadway, ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' by Edward Albee, and they were searching for an actress to play the central role. Ms. Hagen read the play between classes and it so gripped her that she taught her final class, she said, ''in a daze.'' Immediately she agreed to do it, and when she met the playwright she told him the play was ''like a great modern Bosch canvas.''         In the play a faculty couple, George and Martha (Arthur Hill and Ms. Hagen) engage in a long night of mutual abuse -- and revelation. Ms. Hagen's performance galvanized the play. ''Virginia Woolf'' was a turning point for the actress and for Mr. Albee. The play received five Tonys, including awards for both Ms. Hagen and Mr. Hill. In 1964, they both did the play in London.         In the years that followed, Ms. Hagen occasionally ventured back into theater. In 1968, she played Mme. Ranevskaya in Le Gallienne's A.P.A. ''Cherry Orchard.'' Later she did Peter Hacks's ''Charlotte'' (in which she played Goethe's mistress), Shaw's ''You Never Can Tell'' and ''Mrs. Warren's Profession,'' Nicholas Wright's ''Mrs. Klein'' and, in 1998, Donald Margulies's ''Collected Stories.''         After playing Martha on Broadway and London and making a recording with the original cast, she did not return to the role -- until 1999.         In a single performance for the benefit of the HB Playwrights Foundation, she played Martha once more in a staged reading on Broadway. Jonathan Pryce played George and Matthew Broderick and Mia Farrow were the couple's two guests.         At 80, she was aware of the pitfalls. ''It's a terrible risk for me,'' she said. ''I'm 28 years too old for the part. I was 42 when I played it. Martha's supposed to be 52. People have such incredible memories of my performance. I don't see how anybody could possibly live up to it, certainly not me, almost 40 years later.''         But once she came onstage, and said Martha's first line: ''Jesus H. Christ,'' followed by her imitation of Bette Davis saying ''What a dump,'' and as she pitched into verbal battle with her husband, the intervening years passed in a cloud.         Correction:  January 29, 2004, Thursday  An obituary of the Broadway actress and drama teacher Uta Hagen on Jan. 15 misidentified the German city where the cathedral is the site of a statue for which she was named. It is Naumburg, not Nuremberg.       
         Irma Fleck, a physician's wife who looked at the vacant lots and abandoned buildings of her South Bronx neighborhood and retaliated by starting organizations to celebrate art and turn rubble piles into emerald oases, died on Feb. 11 in Naples, Fla.         She was 84 and lived in Naples.         The cause was complications after a broken hip, said her daughter, Bonnie Oppenberg.         Among many other initiatives, Mrs. Fleck helped develop the Claremont Neighborhood Center in the South Bronx, the Bronx Council on the Arts and the Bronx Museum. She also hatched a plan to turn compost from the Hunts Point Market into compost for developing lots that had been ravaged by arson.         ''When I work at something, it's like my child,'' she said in an interview with Newsday in 1994. ''I work intensively, and whatever the project, it becomes very important to me.''         Herman Badillo, a former Bronx borough president, said in an interview yesterday that he remembered Mrs. Fleck as being very aggressive in pursuing project after project.         ''She was one of the most active volunteers in the Bronx,'' he said.         Fernando Ferrer, another former Bronx borough president, said in an interview with The Riverdale Press last week that Mrs. Fleck ''put her own stamp on the Bronx in a very important way.''         Irma Lowenthal was born on Oct. 28, 1919, in Poland, the second of three children. Her father, a doctor, ran his practice out of the family's home near Crotona Park, in the heart of the South Bronx. In the three-story house, the family often put up Jewish refugees who like themselves had fled Hitler.         Miss Lowenthal graduated from Walton High School, earned degrees from Queens College and New York University and worked for her father as an X-ray technician. In 1940, she married Henry Fleck, a physician who had fled Europe in 1932. The newlyweds moved in with relatives on Washington Avenue in the Bronx.         The couple continued living in the Washington Avenue house, where Mrs. Fleck had two children, who survive her, Mrs. Oppenberg, of Marco Island, Fla., and Gary Fleck of Safat, Israel. She is also survived by two brothers, both of whom live in New Jersey, and two grandsons. Dr. Fleck died in 1990.         She believed a physician's wife should be active in the community in which he worked and in 1956 was a founder of the Claremont Neighborhood Center on East 169th Street. She was its president for 11 years, successfully pushing initiatives for affordable housing.         The Flecks moved to a penthouse on the Grand Concourse in the 1960's, and in the 1970's Mrs. Fleck held meetings there to try to reverse the decline of the South Bronx. Eventually, these meetings and contacts would lead to the Bronx Museum, which Mrs. Fleck helped found, forming a group in 1986 called the Committee to Make the Concourse Grand Again.         In 1967, Mrs. Fleck formed the Bronx Committee on the Arts. It soon merged with the Bronx Council on the Arts, formed by Gerald Klot in 1961. Mr. Klot's long involvement in the arts in the Bronx included organizing the Bronx Symphony Orchestra in 1945.         The new organization took the name of Mr. Klot's organization and found a home at the Bronx Community College, part of the City University of New York.         At first, ''We had a couple of drawers in a file there,'' Mrs. Fleck said in an interview with The New York Times in 1971.         The council soon found itself coordinating a host of cultural groups, including the Bronx Opera Company, the Bronx Experimental Theater, the Festival of Poetry and the Bronx Showcase of the Visual Arts.         Mrs. Fleck, as executive director of the council, was proudest of her role in creating the museum. It was housed until 1982 in the rotunda of the Bronx County Courthouse, and from the beginning its exhibitions focused on contemporary artists, minority artists and artists from the Bronx.         In 1982, the museum took over the former Young Israel of the Concourse Synagogue, on the corner of 165th Street and the Grand Concourse, which had been sold to the city by its dwindling congregation. Mrs. Fleck raised public and private money to build an exhibition gallery, classrooms and offices, as well as a new glass-walled lobby.         Perhaps her best known accomplishment was collecting spoiling produce from the huge wholesale center at Hunts Point and selling it for compost. With Jack Flanagan, a former police officer, she formed the Bronx Frontier Development Corporation, which collected as much as 40 tons of compost daily.         The compost was used to fertilize new gardens on vacant lots. ''We're in the recycling business,'' Mrs. Fleck said. ''We're recycling land.''         When the vegetable market began to bag its waste in plastic, Mrs. Fleck persuaded the Bronx Zoo to give her the droppings of elephants and other herbivores to use for fertilizer. She called it ZooDoo, and sold some of it in two-pound bags for $2.50 in smart Manhattan stores.       
         Sylvia Froos, who as a child star in the 1920's sang on early radio broadcasts, starred on the vaudeville stage and appeared in a movie with Shirley Temple, died on Sunday at the Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 89.         The cause was a stroke, said Ilyse Veron, her great-niece.         Miss Froos had a knack for showing up just as a new entertainment medium arose. As Baby Sylvia Froos she made her first radio appearance in 1925, five years after the first commercial radio broadcast in the United States.         In April 1927 she appeared in a movie with sound six months before ''The Jazz Singer,'' starring Al Jolson, was released. She was one of several top vaudevillians who made short talkies intended to accompany feature movies and, ultimately, to replace live vaudevillians in the movie palaces.         In England in the mid-1930's she appeared on television, years before it was available in the United States. In the 1940's she appeared in about a half-dozen film soundies, forerunners of music videos that could be played for a dime on jukeboxlike machines. In recent years some of her shorts have been shown on the Turner Classic Movies cable network, helping to rekindle her fame.         When Baby Sylvia metamorphosed into the Little Princess of Song, Miss Froos became a vaudeville headliner at the Palace Theater in New York, appearing with acts like the Marx Brothers and Bill Bojangles Robinson. She had her own radio show on NBC's New York City affiliate and was a vocalist with big bands. But she never reached the status of Jolson, Paul Whiteman or other big stars with whom she performed, and she largely slipped from recognition in the 1950's and 60's.         ''She was for sure a name act, but not like a superstar caliber,'' said Alan Cooperman, a participant in the Vitaphone Project, which preserves very old sound movies like those in which Miss Froos appeared.         Sylvia Froos was born in Manhattan on April 19, 1914, and grew up in the Bronx. When she was 7, her mother signed her up in a juvenile vaudeville troupe called Kid's Cabaret. The group's first date was in Baltimore, but she was not allowed to appear there because she was too young, she said in ''The Vaudevillians'' by Bill Smith (Macmillan, 1976).         She began to appear on her own as a singing act in vaudeville shows at the Palace and elsewhere. Soon she was appearing in vaudeville theaters around the country. She received some education at the Manhattan Professional Children's School.         In 1927 she appeared in two one-reel Vitaphone shorts filmed in the New York Opera House and released by Warner Brothers. One was ''The Little Princess of Song.''         The only feature film in which she appeared was ''Stand Up and Cheer,'' released in 1934. She dressed in cowgirl garb and sang ''Broadway's Gone Hill Billy.'' Her mother and Miss Temple's went together to get working papers for their daughters.         She performed in vaudeville in London and Dublin in the 1930's as its popularity ebbed in the United States. Until about 1950 she made records, including one with the musician and humorist Allan Sherman, released before he gained national prominence.         Miss Froos is survived by her sister Betty Froos of Manhattan and Florida. Her other sister, Mildred Froos, died in 2000.         In her youthful travels Miss Froos was once arrested for moving onstage. A local law allowed child performers to stand and sing, period. The judge asked her to hop on a table and do a number from the show. She chose a touching song about a mother.         ''I see nothing wrong in this little lady's song,'' the judge said, according to Miss Froos in ''The Vaudevillians.'' ''I only ask if she ever finds a daddy song that she please sing it for me. Case dismissed.''       
         Irene Manning, a lyric soprano and actress who charmed audiences with her performances in 1940's musical films like ''Yankee Doodle Dandy,'' ''Shine On, Harvest Moon'' and ''The Desert Song,'' died on May 28 at her home in San Carlos, Calif. She was 91.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said her stepdaughter Peggy H. Schafer of Pleasanton, Calif.         Trained as a classical singer, Ms. Manning had a fleeting but stellar career as a leading lady. She appeared glamorously in westerns, on Broadway and the London stage and entertained wounded soldiers in World War II.         Still billed as Hope Manning, she made her Broadway debut in 1939 in ''Susanna, Don't You Cry,'' a bouquet of Stephen Foster songs arranged into a musical for the American Lyric Theater at the Martin Beck. The show soon closed, but she received good reviews, and Warner Brothers signed her for ''Yankee Doodle Dandy,'' a blockbuster musical of 1942 with James Cagney as the producer and songwriter George M. Cohan. Ms. Manning portrayed the diva Fay Templeton and sang ''Mary Is a Grand Old Name'' and ''So Long, Mary.'' Because the movie is a perennial on television, it is probably her most famous film role.         She played opposite Humphrey Bogart in ''The Big Shot,'' a hard-boiled gangster movie of 1943, and in a version of ''The Desert Song'' also in 1943, with Dennis Morgan. She appeared the next year in ''Shine On, Harvest Moon'' and ''Make Your Own Bed'' and made two forgettable war pictures before returning to Broadway in 1945 for ''The Day Before Spring,'' an original Lerner-Loewe caper about a class reunion, with ballets by Antony Tudor.         During the war, she had led a four-women U.S.O. troupe touring for the Air Force and performing at hospitals throughout Britain. She also recorded four songs, in German, with Glenn Miller's orchestra just before he died in a plane crash in 1944, including ''Begin the Beguine'' and ''All the Things You Are.''         Ms. Manning was born Inez Harvout into a musical family in Cincinnati; both her parents were singers. She trained at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester and seemed headed for the opera stage.         Her first movie was ''The Old Corral'' (1936), starring Gene Autry, and she was in at least two more westerns before her Broadway debut.         After the war she returned to England for a time to work onstage and had a BBC television show, ''An American in England.'' In the 1950's she toured in America and appeared in regional theaters and on television, notably with Cyril Ritchard in ''The King and Mrs. Candle'' (1955). She had the lead in ''The Tattoed Princess,'' a 1961 musical at the Barbizon Plaza Theater in Manhattan in 1961.         She taught voice and acting into the mid-1990's but performed only occasionally.         In 1964 Ms. Manning married Maxwell White Hunter II, a rocket engineer and space-flight manager, with whom she lived in San Carlos until his death, in 2001.         In addition to Ms. Schafer, Ms. Manning is survived by another stepdaughter, Sally H. Wiley of Evanston, Ill.; three stepsons, Matthew S. Hunter of Los Angeles; Maxwell Hunter III and David M. Hunter, both of Holidaysburg, Pa.; and five grandchildren.         Correction:  June 12, 2004, Saturday  An obituary on Thursday about Irene Manning, a singing film actress of the 1940's, misstated the name of an Off Broadway musical in which she appeared in 1961. It was ''The Tattooed Countess,'' not ''The Tattooed Princess.''       
         Sonya Haddad, who did opera translations for the Metropolitan's seat-back subtitling system, died on June 15 in the Bronx. She was 67 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was complications of cancer, said her sister, Barbara Haddad Ryan.         Fluent in German, Italian and French, Ms. Haddad was one of the country's leading practitioners of her art, translating and simplifying librettos, with the words then displayed for audience members who chose to use the system -- an innovation at the Met in 1995. In addition to working for the Met, which she did through the 2003-04 season, she wrote surtitles or subtitles for the Washington National Opera, La Scala and the Public Broadcasting series ''Great Performances.'' During her long career in classical music she also served as an assistant to Rudolf Serkin, Alexander Schneider and Ravi Shankar.         After graduating from the Eastman School of Music at the University of Rochester in 1958, Ms. Haddad, who was born in Canton, Ohio, started working as an administrator at Columbia Records, in the classical music division run by Goddard Lieberson. A year later, she left to work in programming at WQXR, the radio station of The New York Times.         In 1960 she moved to Spoleto, Italy, to work at the Festival of Two Worlds, the annual cultural showcase that celebrates the collaboration of Europe and America. She returned to the United States in the mid-1970's and started working for the Met in 1994. At the end of her career she was on the staff of Opera News, the magazine of the Metropolitan Opera Guild.         Mrs. Ryan, of Alexandria, Va., is her only survivor.       
         Yoko Watanabe, a Japanese soprano who was renowned for the gracefulness and intensity of her portrayal of Cio-Cio-San, the tragic title character of Puccini's ''Madama Butterfly,'' died on July 15 at her home in Milan. She was 51.         A Japan Opera Foundation official announced her death to The Associated Press but did not give a cause. Miss Watanabe learned she had cancer in 2000.         Miss Watanabe was born in Fukuoka, Japan, in 1953 and early on, hoped to make a career as a dancer. She began studying Japanese dance when she was 3 and ballet when she was 6, but gave up dancing when her teachers said she was too tall and broad-shouldered for a professional career. She then took up the piano and became an accomplished player.         Miss Watanabe gave recitals until she was 18, but she was already thinking about the opera stage. When she was 16, she attended a performance of ''Madama Butterfly'' that, she said later, changed her life.         ''I knew immediately that I wanted to sing opera,'' she told The New York Times in 1988. ''When the performance was over, I went to the stage door and asked the soprano who sang Cio-Cio-San -- Kuniko Kozono -- to please teach me. And she did.''         From there, Miss Watanabe continued her studies at the University of Japan in Tokyo. A competition victory in 1976 took her to La Scala in Milan, where she continued her studies. Miss Watanabe had won second prize in that Tokyo competition. The first-prize winner was Renato Grimaldi, an Italian tenor whom she married and who survives her.         Another competition victory led to Miss Watanabe's professional debut, as Nedda in Leoncavallo's ''Pagliacci,'' in Treviso, Italy, in 1978. She made her La Scala debut in 1985 as Liù in Puccini's ''Turandot,'' and in her 20-year career she sang other major Puccini heroines as well as roles in works of Mozart, Verdi, Gounod and Bizet.         But the portrayal for which she was best known was Cio-Cio-San, the geisha who marries an American naval officer and is abandoned by him. It was as Cio-Cio-San that she made her debuts with the Royal Opera in 1983, the Lyric Opera of Chicago in 1986, and the Metropolitan Opera in 1987.         Reviewing her Met debut for The New York Times, Will Crutchfield described Miss Watanabe's tone as having ''more metal than cream in it'' but praised her ''heartfelt portrayal'' and the subtleties of her characterization. Part of her success, too, came from the way she balanced Western and Japanese acting styles.         ''I am Japanese, and my figure is Japanese,'' she said, ''but the music is Italian, so I try not to do too much of what we would think of as Japanese theatrical movement. In Japanese theater, our movements are very small. We walk in small steps, we make small gestures. I don't believe those would really convey the character of Butterfly fully to the public. After all, this is a very dramatic opera.''         Miss Watanabe collapsed during a performance in December 1999 and retired a month later when her doctors diagnosed her cancer.       
         Semiha Berksoy, the first lady of Turkish opera as well as one of the most colorful figures in contemporary Turkish art, died Aug. 15 in Istanbul. She was 94.         The cause was a pulmonary embolism, her daughter, Zeliha, said.         In addition to her career as a soprano, in which her heavy makeup made her a symbolic image in Turkish culture, she was known internationally for her paintings, which often depicted a little girl, a personification of herself         She was born in 1910 in Istanbul, where her father was an accountant who wrote poetry and her mother was a painter. Her talents were discovered when she was very young, and her parents sent her to the Istanbul conservatory to study music and visual arts. She had her first professional stage experience at 19, and she was 21 when she was given the leading role in the first Turkish sound movie, ''Istanbul Sokaklari'' (''The Streets of Istanbul'').         She was asked to sing in the first Turkish opera, ''Ozsoy,'' in the presence of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey, who said he was stunned by her voice.         Soon after, Miss Berksoy qualified for a scholarship to the Berlin Music Academy and left for Germany. She sang the leading role in "Ariadne Auf Naxos" in 1939, the first Turkish opera star to take the stage in Europe.         Despite her success in Germany, she chose to return to Turkey that year and assist in establishing the first opera house in Ankara.         ''She was determined to raise Turkish opera among the leading opera houses in the world,'' Zeliha Berksoy said in a telephone interview.         Miss Berksoy's personal life reflected her revolutionary character, as she never hesitated to visit her lover, the celebrated left-wing Turkish poet Nazim Hikmet, in prison, despite the risk of being labeled a Communist.         She also appeared onstage in daring costumes, challenging traditional concepts of stage propriety and classical art.         In a stage performance at the Babylon club in Istanbul in November 2000, she joined a percussion group and performed in a wide spectrum of the arts -- from poetry to singing to drawing to drama -- in a transparent self-painted costume.         She also sang in "The Days Before" at Lincoln Center in New York in 1999, a year before her formal farewell to the stage.         But she never fully retired. In 2003, she participated in the Vienna Biennial with her stage interpretation of ''Salome,'' and she was preparing another project, ''Beethoven Night,'' with Robert Wilson, a friend, for 2005.         A foundation named after her, started by her artist friends, is planning a memorial event for next year to commemorate the 75th anniversary of her career at the State Opera.       
         Dame Alicia Markova, one of the greatest British ballerinas of the 20th century, co-founder of the company now known as the English National Ballet and a former director of the Metropolitan Opera Ballet, died yesterday in Bath, England, the English National Ballet announced. She was 94.         Famous for her delicacy, Dame Alicia was indelibly associated with ''Giselle,'' the supreme example of 19th-century balletic Romanticism. It was as Giselle that she made her American debut with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1938, giving a performance that was thought to set a standard for any other dancer attempting the part. She later performed Giselle as a star of Ballet Theater (as American Ballet Theater was originally called) and as a guest artist with companies around the world. She was so closely identified with the ballet that in 1960 she titled her autobiography ''Giselle and I.''         Audiences never tired of watching Dame Alicia in ''Giselle''; she, in turn, never seemed to tire of dancing it. Reviewing a 1958 performance by Ballet Theater in which Miss Markova appeared as guest artist, John Martin, then the dance critic of The New York Times, remarked: ''Markova has danced the role so many times that she could undoubtedly do it in her sleep; what is so notable is that she never does. She is as fresh, as sensitive, as creatively alert as if she had never done it before; but what a wealth of background she has accumulated for it!''         Lillian Alicia Marks was born in London on Dec. 1, 1910. A knock-kneed child, she was sent by her doctor to a London school called Miss Thorne's Dancing Academy. She astounded her teacher with her ability to do anything asked of her, and she was soon cast in dancing roles in Christmas pantomimes.         Mrs. Marks took her daughter to a London school run by the ballerina Serafina Astafieva. She presented Astafieva with a card bearing the child's name as she had been billed in the pantomimes: ''Little Alicia: The Miniature Pavlova.'' Aghast at this presumption, Astafieva slammed the door in their faces. Later, however, she saw Alicia dance and accepted her as a pupil.         In 1924 the teenage Alicia became the youngest member of Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, the greatest ballet company of its day. She danced her first leading role in 1926, when she portrayed the nightingale in ''Le Rossignol,'' choreographed by George Balanchine to music by Stravinsky. Non-Russian dancers in the Ballets Russes were expected to change their names, and it was Diaghilev who gave the British dancer her professional name. He also gave Miss Markova a governess, who made sure that her charge went to bed early when she was not performing and saw to it that she did not overindulge in chocolates and that she attended no social occasions but chaperoned teas.         After Diaghilev died in 1929, Miss Markova returned to London and became active with both of the pioneering British ballet groups of the day, the Ballet Rambert and the Vic-Wells Ballet, the last of which developed into the Royal Ballet. Because she was already an esteemed dancer, her presence lent prestige to these troupes and, because she was British, she proved that ballet was not something in which only Russians could excel.         In 1934 she formed the Markova-Dolin Ballet with another British dancer, Anton Dolin, the partner with whom she was associated for much of her career. She joined the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1938, remaining with it until 1941, when she joined Ballet Theater, where Mr. Dolin was again her partner. In 1945 they formed a Markova-Dolin Ballet in America.         Returning to Britain after the war, they made their troupe the basis of the London Festival Ballet (today's English National Ballet). Mr. Dolin was its first director; Miss Markova was its ballerina until 1952, after which she devoted herself to guest performances. She retired as a dancer in 1963, the year Queen Elizabeth II named her Dame of the British Empire.         Known for her beautiful purity of line and her classic simplicity of movement, Dame Alicia was admired in ''Swan Lake'' and ''Les Sylphides'' as well as in ''Giselle.'' Yet this ethereal ballerina could surprise audiences with her range. She certainly did so with Ballet Theater in 1942 when she danced two contrasting roles. One was Juliet in Antony Tudor's ''Romeo and Juliet.'' In 1946 the dance historian Grace Robert praised that interpretation in ''The Borzoi Book of Ballets,'' writing that ''Markova's deerlike shyness in the first scene, her tragic, controlled despair, the exquisite movement of her hand as she wakes up in the tomb scene, all are unforgettable in their subtlety.''         But this poignant Juliet was tempestuous as the gypsy Zemphira in Léonide Massine's ''Aleko.'' ''The great surprise of 'Aleko' was the superb Zemphira of Alicia Markova,'' Robert wrote. ''Her exquisite 'Swan Lake' and matchless 'Giselle' contained no hint of the fire and quite different sort of dramatic intensity of her gypsy. With sunburnt makeup, wild hair and a vivid red costume, her very appearance was a shock, though a delightful one.''         Dame Alicia, who had occasionally made guest appearances in the ballet sequences of works in the repertory of the Metropolitan Opera, astonished the dance world in 1963 when she accepted an invitation to direct the Metropolitan Opera Ballet. The Met's dance troupe had never been considered important and the opera management had seldom shown much interest in ballet. Nevertheless, in her six years as director, Dame Alicia raised the dancers' technical level and made it possible for the ballet company to present programs of its own.         In 1970 Dame Alicia became a distinguished lecturer on ballet at the University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music, the home school of the Cincinnati Ballet. She remained there until 1974, after which she gave occasional master classes for many organizations, including the Royal Ballet School. She also staged revivals of ballets in which she had starred, and presided over dance festivals and conferences.         A gala was held in honor of Dame Alicia's 80th birthday on Dec. 2, 1990, at the Sadler's Wells Theater in London. On that occasion, Dame Ninette de Valois, founder of the Royal Ballet, spoke in tribute to her.         A tiny black-haired woman, Dame Alicia was just over 5 feet 2 inches tall, and during her dancing years she rarely weighed more than 98 pounds, even though she usually devoured a thick steak after performances.         Her life was as carefully organized as her dancing. She moved through each day with quiet determination and her life was almost entirely devoted to ballet. She never married. Among her few diversions were expensive clothes, classical music and gin rummy, at which she usually won.       
         The soprano Renata Tebaldi, one of the most beloved opera singers of all time -- Arturo Toscanini, hard to please, said she had ''the voice of an angel'' -- died yesterday in the Republic of San Marino, where she had a home, her doctor told The Associated Press. Miss Tebaldi, who had been in failing health for several months, was 82.         At her best, in roles like Puccini's Mimi and Tosca and Verdi's Desdemona and Alice Ford, Miss Tebaldi was a singer of overwhelming expressivity and matchless vocal allure; arguably, hers was the most sumptuously beautiful lirico-spinto soprano voice (one combining lighter lyrical and weightier dramatic qualities) to emerge from Italy in the 20th century.         Cooler heads could fault her for what often seemed incomplete technique, some strident full-voiced top notes when the vocal line took her above high B-flat, and occasional lapses in pitch. But most opera buffs and critics found it impossible to have a cool head when listening to Renata Tebaldi. She beguiled listeners with the sheer plummy richness of her voice, the melting legato phrases, the deeply expressive yet never maudlin emotional quality of her singing, the unearthly beauty of her floated pianissimo high notes and the temperament she could summon in moments of dramatic intensity.         Though a dedicated artist, she was reluctant to challenge herself. She avoided singing in any language other than Italian, deeming French too nasal and German too guttural, always afraid to compromise the beauty of her sound in her native tongue. But what she considered cautiousness, some critics thought complacency. A vocal crisis in 1963, compounded by exhaustion, compelled her to take a year off, during which she recuperated and reworked her technique. When she returned to the stage in 1964, even some of her most ardent fans conceded that her voice had lost some of its luster.         Still, during what she called her ''second career,'' Miss Tebaldi did some exquisite singing and continued to win understandable devotion from the public. After a deeply affecting and vocally exquisite performance as Desdemona in Verdi's ''Otello'' one night at the Metropolitan Opera, the audience kept her coming back for so many curtain calls that she finally appeared wearing her coat around her costume, to signal that she needed to go home.         Tall and stately, she was a lovely woman with creamy white skin, big blue eyes, and trademark dimples when she smiled. Rudolf Bing, the crusty general manager of the Met during Miss Tebaldi's prime years, knew her demanding side. ''Miss Renata Tebaldi was always sweet and very firm,'' he once said. ''She had dimples of iron.''         During the 1950's, she endured a public rivalry with the soprano Maria Callas. Biographies of the two divas present contrary accounts of who started it and how. The dispute was fueled by publicists and an eager press. But artistically, the idea that they were opposites -- Callas the galvanizing dramatic artist and Tebaldi the supreme vocalist who valued beauty of sound above all else -- was wrongheaded. In roles like Violetta from the Verdi opera ''La Traviata,'' Callas could sing with vocal elegance and vulnerability; in roles like Verdi's Aida, Miss Tebaldi could be fiery and impetuous.         For all Miss Tebaldi's accomplishments, her career faltered in the late 1960's. When she retired in 1976, she was only 54. Still, she began early and had as active and successful a first 15 years as any singer of the 20th century.         Renata Ersilia Clotilde Tebaldi was born on Feb. 1, 1922, in Pesaro, Italy. Her father, Teobaldo Tebaldi, was a wounded soldier from the First World War when he met and married Giuseppina Barbieri, a gifted singer who had wanted a musical career but became a nurse. Six years younger than his wife, Teobaldo was restless and unfaithful. The marriage fell apart when Renata, their only child, was 3. Giuseppina took the little girl back to her hometown, Langhirano, outside Parma.         Not long afterward the child woke one morning and could hardly stand. The diagnosis was polio. She began treatments -- injections, massages, thermal compresses, physical therapy -- that lasted five years but proved successful. During this time she and her mother bonded tightly. When Miss Tebaldi's career began, her mother traveled with her constantly, essentially continuing until, at 68, she died in New York in 1957, a loss that devastated Miss Tebaldi. (Despite periodic meetings over the years with her father, they never fully reconciled.)         At first as a child, Miss Tebaldi was drawn to the piano, and she enrolled in studies at the conservatory in Parma, which necessitated a difficult commute. When she was 17, her piano teacher persuaded her to study voice at the conservatory with Ettore Campogalliani, who would later recall her as a scrupulous, perceptive student with a passion for music who kept a certain distance between herself and others. Later the renowned vocal pedagogue Carmen Melis became her most important teacher.         Her opera debut was in 1944, in the smaller role of Elena in Boito's ''Mefistofele'' at the regional theater in Rovigo, Italy. Instant success propelled her into appearances in Parma as Puccini's Mimi in ''La Bohème,'' her first Desdemona and other roles. In 1946, she auditioned with Toscanini at La Scala in Milan, and Miss Tebaldi later said that she remembered every detail of it: her queasiness as she waited backstage, the fearsome presence of the gruff maestro, and finally Toscanini's shouts of ''Brava, brava!'' This led to a career-making appearance in a concert to reopen the La Scala opera house, heavily damaged during the Second World War.         By the time of her much-anticipated Met debut in January 1955, as Desdemona, Miss Tebaldi was already a celebrated singer. Today's opera buffs can only swoon looking at the cast list that night, with Mario Del Monaco as Otello, Leonard Warren as Iago and Fritz Stiedry conducting. The critic Olin Downes hedged in his initial assessment for The New York Times. But by the time of her first Met Mimi, in February, Downes was duly impressed. ''It is a voice of range and colors of all sorts, and one that throbs with feeling,'' he wrote.         Singing always came first for Miss Tebaldi. She never married and had no children. Yet for a 1995 biography, she openly discussed several romances: a youthful attachment with a handsome medical student to whom she was briefly engaged; a lighthearted relationship with Nicola Rossi-Lemeni, the renowned bass of Italian and Russian heritage; and, most significantly, an intense romance with the conductor Arturo Basile, a hardy and generous man who was in the last phase of a deteriorating marriage when he and Miss Tebaldi began their four-year relationship in 1958.         In a 1995 interview with The Times, Miss Tebaldi said she had no regrets about her single life. ''I was in love many times,'' she said, flashing her dimpled smile. ''This is very good for a woman.'' But she added, ''How could I have been a wife, a mother and a singer? Who takes care of the piccolini when you go around the world? Your children would not call you Mama, but Renata.''         In 1973, Miss Tebaldi sang her final performance at the Met, again as Desdemona, with James McCracken in the title role, Sherrill Milnes as Iago and a young James Levine conducting. She had sung some 270 performances with the Met, a house where she considered herself ''la regina'' -- the queen.         From then on she sang only in recitals. In January 1976, she made it partway through a recital at Carnegie Hall, which she assumed would be her farewell to New York. She had to stop because she was ''too emotional,'' as Rudolf Bing told the audience on her behalf. A month later she tried again and sang the program, complete with six encores, to tumultuous ovations, though her singing was shaky.         Almost 20 years later, she returned again to New York to sign copies of an authorized biography by Carlamaria Casanova, ''Tebaldi: The Voice of an Angel'' (Baskerville Publishers). A line of autograph-seekers stretched from the Met's gift shop across Lincoln Center Plaza and up Broadway.         Miss Tebaldi had a long and productive relationship with the Decca recording company (also called London Records) and left classic accounts of major roles in complete recordings of ''Otello,'' ''La Forza del Destino,'' ''Andrea Chenier,'' ''La Bohème,'' ''Tosca,'' ''Madama Butterfly'' and ''Il Trovatore,'' among many other works. Asked during that 1995 interview how she felt about her discography, she said, ''I cry when I hear the records.'' She added: ''Now I understand what happened during my performances. I feel the same thing. Not because I know I am Renata Tebaldi, but because I can be objective.''       
         Frances Chaney, a radio star whose budding film career was stifled after she and her husband, Ring Lardner Jr., were placed on a Hollywood blacklist, died on Nov. 23 at her home in Manhattan. She was 89.         Ms. Chaney, who had Alzheimer's disease, died in her sleep, said her son James.         Mr. Lardner was one of the Hollywood 10, jailed in 1950 for contempt of Congress for refusing to answer whether they were Communists. Ms. Chaney was blacklisted because she was correctly assumed to be, as Mr. Lardner's wife, a Communist.         Ms. Chaney found herself unemployed after years appearing on popular radio series like ''Topper,'' ''Gangbusters'' and ''Mr. District Attorney.'' At one point, she spent her mornings playing an ingénue in ''House in the Country'' and her afternoons playing the worldly Burma in ''Terry and the Pirates.''         She had parlayed her radio work into a few screen parts before the blacklist started costing her jobs, but she was able to win parts in Off Broadway and Broadway plays, including understudying for Maureen Stapleton, Kim Stanley and Claudette Colbert.         By the time the blacklist's power faded, Ms. Chaney was entrenched as a stage actress. She worried that she was being typecast as a Jewish mother, a part she played in ''Golda'' on Broadway with Anne Bancroft, in James Lapine's Off Broadway ''Table Settings,'' and in three separate productions of Clifford Odets's ''Awake and Sing.''         Born Fanya Lipetz on July 23, 1915, in Odessa, Ukraine, Ms. Chaney immigrated with her parents to the Bronx when she was a child. After briefly attending Hunter College, she studied on a scholarship at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre.         In the 1960's, she had a recurring role on the soap opera ''The Edge of Night.''         Ms. Chaney's first husband, David Lardner, was a younger brother of Ring Lardner Jr.'s. David Lardner died in 1944. Ring Lardner Jr. died in 2000.         In addition to her son James, of Manhattan, Ms. Chaney is survived by a daughter, Katharine, of Manhattan; another son, Joseph, of Los Angeles; two stepchildren, Peter, of St. Augustine, Fla., and Ann Waswo, of Oxford, England; seven grandchildren; and eight great-granddaughters.
