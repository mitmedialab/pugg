         Irene Diamond, who after a successful career scouting scripts and talent in Hollywood became a major benefactor of the arts and medical research in New York City, died Tuesday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 92.         At her death, she was president of the Irene Diamond Fund, which she established in 1994 to support, in particular, the performing arts and the fight against AIDS. The fund succeeded the Aaron Diamond Foundation, which she and her husband, a New York real estate developer, set up in the 1950's.         In the 1980's, the couple took an innovative step, deciding to pay out that foundation's considerable wealth over 10 years. They made the decision just before Aaron Diamond, developer of Roosevelt Island, died in 1984. (She liked to say that at the time they married, however, she made more money than her husband.)         Mrs. Diamond remained in control of the foundation after his death. Over the next decade, as planned, she oversaw the distribution of $220 million in about 700 donations, with more than $50 million earmarked for the fight against AIDS.         Among the foundation's top priorities was the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center for the City of New York, affiliated with Rockefeller University. There, in a laboratory building facing Bellevue Hospital Center, its director, Dr. David D. Ho, made crucial discoveries about the immune system's struggle with the AIDS virus.         Through her own fund, Mrs. Diamond invested heavily in New York institutions like Lincoln Center. Recent gifts include $1.2 million for Jazz at Lincoln Center's new home, now being built at the former Coliseum site, and large grants for the Dance Theater of Harlem, New York City Ballet and the New York Public Library.         She aided causes like gun control and AIDS programs in the public schools and gave $10 million to the Juilliard School for a program to attract gifted minority students and teachers.         President Bill Clinton recognized her philanthropy in 1999 with the National Medal of Arts, and in 2001 she received the Andrew Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy. She also sat on the boards of Young Concert Artists, the Film Society of Lincoln Center and Human Rights Watch.         Irene Levine was born to immigrant parents in Pittsburgh, where she attended public schools. Hoping to be an actor, she took the name Irene Lee and studied repertory theater in Manhattan.         She did some modeling and freelance reading for Warner Brothers in New York before getting a job in Hollywood as an assistant editor in the studio's story division. At a meeting with the producer Hal B. Wallis, she began a 25-year collaboration in which she made recommendations on the work of as many as 32 writers. Some of the scripts that crossed her desk became classics, like ''The Maltese Falcon'' and ''Dark Victory.''         In 1941, back in New York, she read an unproduced play, ''Everybody Comes to Rick's,'' by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison. It came with several rejection slips, but its theme of the tough but idealistic American and his bar in Morocco seemed to her a perfect fit for the world news of the day.         She persuaded Mr. Wallis to let her buy the play for $20,000 -- he gave it the name ''Casablanca'' -- and the movie, starring Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, came out in 1943. It was just in time for the Allied invasion of North Africa and the Casablanca Conference of Roosevelt and Churchill.         After her marriage to Mr. Diamond in 1942, she continued to work in show business, back in New York. After a brief stint working for the producer Sam Goldwyn, she again worked with Mr. Wallis at Paramount Pictures as a story editor and was head of the talent division until 1970.         She was involved with films like ''Sorry, Wrong Number,'' with Barbara Stanwyck, and ''Come Back, Little Sheba,'' with Shirley Booth. She met and furthered the careers of actors like Burt Lancaster, Kirk Douglas and Robert Redford.         Mrs. Diamond is survived by a daughter, Jean, and two grandsons.         Speaking about ''Casablanca'' and her charitable priorities, she liked to say that ''philanthropy is a lot like Hollywood: you find a good script; you support it.''         Her own Irene Diamond Fund will continue her work, said Jane Silver, its executive director.         Correction:  February 15, 2003, Saturday  An obituary on Jan. 23 about Irene Diamond, a philanthropist who had an earlier career scouting Hollywood film scripts, including one that became the classic ''Casablanca,'' misstated the year of that film's release. It was 1942, not 1943.       
         Mary Brian, a film star and memorable ingénue who bridged the silent and early sound eras, died on Monday in Del Mar, Calif. She was 96 and lived in Los Angeles.         Between ''Peter Pan'' in 1924 and ''Dragnet'' in 1947 Ms. Brian appeared in 82 films. Petite, with blue-gray eyes and dark-brown curls, she was one of Hollywood's romantic leading ladies from the mid-1920's through the late 30's.         While she did not rank with superstars like Clara Bow or Mary Pickford, she was a bankable contract player and a gratifying attraction at the box office. Her leading men were the likes of Gary Cooper, Lew Ayres, James Cagney, Cary Grant, William Haines, Warner Oland and Dick Powell.         Among her films still shown at film festivals and on television are ''Peter Pan'' and one of the earliest western talkies, ''The Virginian,'' from 1929, with Cooper as the title character and Walter Huston as the villain.         In that film Ms. Brian portrayed Molly Wood, a schoolteacher who is the Virginian's romantic interest. In his review in The New York Times, Mordaunt Hall wrote that there was good humor in Medicine Bow when ''the lass from the East clashes with the lads from the West,'' adding that Ms. Brian helped the picture along, although ''she might have been more persuasive with less rouge on her lips.''         The review also said that ''the sounds, whether footfalls, horses' hoofs, rumbling wheels or voices, are really remarkably recorded and reproduced,'' and noted that movie depictions of life in the Wild West were ''aided immeasurably by the audibility of the screen.''         Ms. Brian was born Louise Byrdie Dantzler in Corsicana, Tex. After the family's move to Long Beach, Calif., she entered a beauty contest -- and though she did not win a prize, Paramount invited her to audition for a child's part in its film version of ''Peter Pan.''         The director, Herbert Brenon, cast the young Louise as Wendy. The studio gave her a new name, Mary Brian, and pared her age to 16, deeming 18 too grown up for the part. (After that, Ms. Brian kept her real age to herself, calling it ''negotiable.'')         She remained under contract to Paramount until 1932, appearing in more than 40 of its productions. She showed her mettle as juvenile lead or co-star in ''Beau Geste'' (1926), another Brenon film, and in ''Behind the Front'' (1926), ''Harold Teen'' (1926) and ''River of Romance'' (1929).         Easily navigating the changeover to sound, she appeared in two 1931 evergreens, George Cukor's ''Royal Family of Broadway'' and Lewis Milestone's ''Front Page.''         She played W. C. Fields's daughter in several films, including ''The Man on the Flying Trapeze'' (1935). Working with him she developed a knack for playing the straight woman in comedy, which came in handy later in her career.         Among her other movies of the 1930's were ''Shadows of Sing Sing,'' ''College Rhythm,'' ''Charlie Chan in Paris'' and ''Navy Blues.'' She appeared as herself in ''Hollywood on Parade No. 9'' (1933) and ''Star Night at the Cocoanut Grove'' (1934).         She took to the stage in vaudeville productions at the Palace Theater in New York in 1932 and toured in the 1940's with Edmund Lowe in a farce, ''Mary Had a Little . . .''         Ms. Brian said she gained a new perspective on life during World War II when she entertained troops, venturing closer to the front lines in Europe than most headliners. She spent Christmas 1944 with the soldiers fighting the Battle of the Bulge.         She ended her movie career after the war with ''Dragnet,'' but continued to make occasional television appearances.         In 1947 Ms. Brian married George Tomasini, a Hollywood film editor; he died in 1964.         She is survived by her godson, Stuart Erwin Jr., of Rancho Santa Fe, Calif.       
         Natalya Dudinskaya, who wielded major influence over the Kirov Ballet in Leningrad as its leading ballerina in the 1940's and 50's and as a revered teacher and the wife of its onetime artistic director, Konstantin Sergeyev, died on Wednesday in St. Petersburg. She was 90.         With her exceptionally brilliant classical technique, Ms. Dudinskaya was one of the most virtuosic dancers in the first generation of Soviet ballerinas after the Russian Revolution.         Although she starred in the 19th-century classics, from the time she joined the Kirov in 1931, she also created roles in many modern landmark Soviet ballets. In 1939, Vakhtang Chabukiani choreographed ''Laurencia'' and cast her opposite himself as his fiery Spanish heroine. The ballet became her signature piece and in 1958, as the Kirov's prima ballerina, she chose the unknown Rudolf Nureyev to partner her in ''Laurencia.''         He was 20 and she was 46, and he always expressed gratitude to Ms. Dudinskaya for this performance, the springboard for his international career. When the Kirov was scheduled to make its debut in Paris, London and New York in 1961, the producers insisted that Sergeyev (who died in 1992) and Ms. Dudinskaya not dance and yield to younger dancers. Nureyev, cast in leading roles, became a sensation in Paris.         After his defection there, Sergeyev and Ms. Dudinskaya were implicitly held responsible by Soviet authorities. In 1962 the government newspaper Izvestia printed a letter from Irina Kolpakova, Alla Shelest and other Kirov ballerinas, accusing the couple of hindering the careers of younger dancers.         The pair weathered the storm. Sergeyev was removed as artistic director of the Kirov in 1970 but three years later became director of its school, the Vaganova Academy. Ms. Dudinskaya, a favorite pupil of the celebrated teacher Agrippina Vaganova, retired from dancing in 1962 and became internationally known as a teacher and authority on the 19th-century classics. She coached several such productions at the Boston Ballet, beginning with the acclaimed ''Swan Lake'' that she and Sergeyev staged in 1990.         From 1951 to 1970 she taught the most advanced class at the Kirov and was a coach there from 1963 to 1978. From 1964 on, she taught at the Vaganova Academy.         Born in Kharkov, Ukraine, on Aug. 21, 1912, she was quickly noticed in Leningrad for what the Soviet critic Yuri Slonimsky called ''her chiseled, dazzling technique.''         Unlike her contemporary Galina Ulanova, she was not a lyrical ballerina but a pure classical dancer who was compelling in her outbursts of speed and temperament. Slonimsky called her ''a representative of the new style of Soviet ballet,'' for which she created roles in new works.         Some were choreographed by Sergeyev, who became her husband and her dancing partner after she appeared in his ''Cinderella'' (1946), set to Prokofiev's commissioned score. She also performed in Sergeyev's ''Path of Thunder'' (1957), about an interracial romance during the apartheid era in South Africa.         Nonetheless, she was at her best in classics like ''Swan Lake,'' ''Sleeping Beauty,'' ''Don Quixote,'' ''La Bayadère'' and, especially, ''Raymonda.''       
         Felice Marks Lippert, in whose kitchen Weight Watchers was hatched 40 years ago, died on Saturday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y.         The cause was lung cancer, her family said. Mrs. Lippert was 73 and lived on the East Side of Manhattan and in West Palm Beach, Fla.         Mrs. Lippert played a role in turning a budding business into an international phenomenon with millions of subscribers to its weight-control regimen. She helped develop the company's programs and was a director and vice president of Weight Watchers International until the H. J. Heinz Company acquired it in 1978. Heinz sold the business to a European investment company in 1999.         At the time of her death, Mrs. Lippert was chairwoman of the Weight Watchers Foundation, which promotes nutritional education. She also held the South African Weight Watchers franchise, which the Lipperts acquired in the mid-1990's.         The idea that eventually became Weight Watchers began in 1963, when Mrs. Lippert was living in Baldwin Harbor, N.Y., with her husband, Albert, and their two sons.         The couple had married a decade earlier and had settled into a routine that included weekly gatherings with friends for various activities; for example, they would hire an instructor to learn a new dance. By then the Lipperts had also realized they had a problem; they had put on weight.         Mrs. Lippert had heard about a woman in Queens, Jean Nidetch, who was teaching a diet program, and she asked Mrs. Nidetch to one of the weekly gatherings. A week later, following the nutritional regimen left by Mrs. Nidetch, Mrs. Lippert had lost four pounds and Mr. Lippert had lost seven. Eventually, they lost 100 points between them.         Realizing the potential, the Lipperts and Jean and Marty Nidetch huddled around the Lipperts' kitchen table for weeks to develop a strategy. They came up with the name and the concept of having people come to hear Jean Nidetch rather than her visiting their homes.         The two couples rented a space in Little Neck. Twenty-two people showed up at the first meeting, paying $2 each. Sixty-six showed up in a second space a week later in Baldwin. Within a year, Mr. Lippert began to sell franchises.         Jean Nidetch wrote ''Weight Watchers Program Cookbook,'' which sold millions of copies. Weight Watchers took off comparably.         Felice Lippert was born in the Bronx and graduated from Hunter College. She taught second grade in the New York public schools. She was on the boards of North Shore Hospital, the American Ireland Fund and the Cancer Research and Treatment Fund. She also supported the UJA-Federation of New York; St. Francis Hospital in Port Washington, N.Y.; and Hunter College.         Albert Lippert died in 1998. Mrs. Lippert is survived by two sons, Keith L., of Manhattan and Randy S., of Hellerup, Denmark; two sisters; two brothers; and four grandchildren.       
         Lillian Nadel Gerard, who was active in exhibiting and marketing foreign films in the United States for three decades, died last Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 88.         The cause was complications of cancer, her husband, Philip R. Gerard, said.         After she was hired in 1936 by an American importer of foreign films, she did publicity and advertising for ''The Eternal Mask,'' a film produced in Switzerland.         As she recalled in 1985, ''That picture launched my debut in foreign films, and through my hands passed films of every origin in every genre, films that are now classics: 'Grand Illusion,' 'Pépé le Moko,' 'Children of Paradise,' 'The Seventh Seal' and many others, including a revival of Chaplin's 'City Lights.' ''         Over the years, she was an executive of the Paris Theater in Manhattan and a consultant to the Rugoff Theaters, the Little Carnegie and the Fifth Avenue Cinema. She also worked with independent film importers.         In 1950, as the Paris Theater's managing director, she protested the banning by New York City's Department of Licenses of the film ''The Miracle'' as ''blasphemous'' while it was being shown at the Paris.         She also worked on special projects at the Museum of Modern Art.         A Bronx native, she grew up in Manhattan and graduated from Bernard Baruch College.         Besides her husband, she is survived by a son, Richard; a daughter, Jennifer Gerard Maric; three grandchildren; and a brother, Irwin.       
         Sandy Carlson Tarlow, an advertising executive who was responsible for defining the public face of Polo Ralph Lauren for almost a quarter century, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 59.         The cause was lung cancer, said her husband, Richard Tarlow. Mrs. Tarlow had been ill for four months. Until the onset of her illness, she remained at the helm of Carlson & Partners, the agency that she and her husband founded in 1987.         For 23 years, Mrs. Tarlow handled the account of Ralph Lauren, one of the most visible and successful American clothing companies during that period. Mr. Lauren's clothes initially defined the look of upper-class young men, with the casual but rarefied aura of the brand abetted by the images conjured up by Mrs. Tarlow and her colleagues. Mrs. Tarlow worked with Mr. Lauren on shaping the marketing and image of his company, often meeting with him two or three times a week to review the direction of the campaigns.         As Mr. Tarlow put it, ''Ralph Lauren was the other man in her life.''         Mrs. Tarlow's oversight of advertising for Mr. Lauren made her one of the most prominent women in advertising.         Sandy Carlson Tarlow was born in Shrewsbury, Mass. She earned a bachelor's degree at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.         After graduation, Sandy Carlson moved to New York City to break into advertising. She found work at an agency called Martin Landey, Arlow. But she soon moved to Hawaii for six months.         Before leaving on her trip, Ms. Carlson met Mr. Tarlow, who was working as an advertising salesman at the agency. He had just returned from living in Spain, and she was working at the time as an assistant art director.         The two were married 25 years ago, at a home that they shared in Sag Harbor, N.Y.         Mr. Tarlow struck out on his own and founded Kurtz & Tarlow, where Mrs. Tarlow worked as a partner and creative director. It was there that she acquired the Ralph Lauren account. She nurtured the account for a decade and eventually came to handle the print and broadcast advertising for the company's clothing, home furniture and fragrance divisions. By the late 1980's, the value of the account was estimated at $10 million.         Mrs. Tarlow continued to handle the account even after the agency was bought by another advertising company. But she and her husband eventually decided to start their own agency, with Ralph Lauren as the main client.         In working on advertising for Ralph Lauren, Mrs. Tarlow often collaborated with Bruce Weber, the prominent photographer who shot many of the images used in Mr. Lauren's ads. Her agency also did advertising for the Neutrogena line of skin care products made by Johnson & Johnson.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Tarlow is survived by her son, Cody, a student at the University of California at Santa Cruz; her younger sister, Jamie Anderson, of Westwood, Mass.; two younger brothers, Storm and Bob Carlson, both in Costa Rica; and her mother, Veronica Carlson, of Shrewsbury.       
         Anne Logan Davis Wichern, a lung specialist at Bellevue Hospital Center and professor emeritus at New York University who established one of the country's first emphysema clinics, died March 9. She was 78 and lived on the Upper East Side.         The cause was cancer, her family said, and she died at the Columbia-Presbyterian Center of New York-Presbyterian Hospital.         Dr. Davis, as she was known professionally, was a pioneer in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. She founded the emphysema unit at Bellevue in 1956 and remained its director until two years ago, when it was merged into the hospital's chest and asthma units.         She was associated with Bellevue since she started her internship there in 1949. An authority in pulmonary critical care, she formally retired in December as an attending physician at the hospital.         She directed the Bellevue chest clinic from 1987 to 1992, overseeing some 6,000 patient visits every year. Through the 1970's and 1980's, she also was a physician and consultant at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Manhattan.         She started her academic career as an instructor at the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1957, rising to assistant professor of medicine in 1968. That year, she accepted an associate professorship with permanent tenure at the New York University School of Medicine, from which she retired in December.         Anne Logan Davis was born in Rahway, N.J., and graduated from Wellesley College in 1945 and received her medical degree at Columbia in 1949. She decided to specialize in chest and pediatric pulmonary medicine while a resident at Bellevue in the 1950's, after recovering from tuberculosis contracted during her internship.         From experience, she found that in a busy municipal hospital the special needs of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary illnesses tended to receive short shrift. She was given the opportunity to organize the emphysema clinic to deal comprehensively with the patients' medical, social and economic conditions, and to undertake a systematic study and record of their progress.         Dr. Davis is survived by her husband of 47 years, Dr. Walter Adam Wichern Jr., chairman emeritus of surgery at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center; a son, Walter A. III, and a daughter, A. Logan Wichern, both of Manhattan; and a sister, Carol Goodman of Morristown, N.J.       
         Frankie Hewitt, who spearheaded the revival of Ford's Theater here and turned it into a showplace for plays and musicals, died Friday at her home in Kensington, Md. She was 71.         The cause was cancer, Ford's Theater announced.         Just one day earlier, President Bush had awarded her the National Humanities Medal, one of numerous honors she had won for turning a historical landmark into an important place to learn and enjoy American history and culture.         Mrs. Hewitt got involved with Ford's Theater in the 1960's when plans were being drawn up to renovate it. It had been used mostly as a government warehouse for a century after Abraham Lincoln's assassination in April 1865.         A friend, Stewart L. Udall, then the secretary of the interior, described a plan to turn the building on 10th Street NW into a museum with a light and sound show. Mrs. Hewitt, who was then married to Don Hewitt, producer of ''60 Minutes'' on CBS, argued that it should be more than a testament to the awful historical episode and should make an active contribution to cultural life.         She went to work, negotiating an agreement for the theater to operate as a national historic site and museum. It reopened on Feb. 12, 1968, with a production of Stephen Vincent Benét's ''John Brown's Body.''         When initial shows at Ford's did not draw big audiences, Mrs. Hewitt began to book shows herself. Although she had no theater background, she founded the nonprofit Ford's Theater Society and later produced more than 150 stage shows.         She also was executive producer of more than 15 network television specials broadcast from Ford's Theater. Through a series of televised galas Mrs. Hewitt drew national attention to Ford's and raised money.         Mrs. Hewitt was born Frankie Teague in Oklahoma's Dust Bowl and migrated at the age of 8 with her impoverished family to California. After stints in journalism and public relations, she moved to Washington in 1956. She then served as the staff director of a Senate subcommittee, followed by a job as public affairs adviser to Adlai Stevenson, then ambassador to the United Nations.         She is survived by her daughters, Jilian Childers Hewitt, from her first marriage, to Bob Childers, and Lisa Hewitt Cassara, from her marriage to Mr. Hewitt, which ended in divorce in 1974. She also is survived by two grandsons, two stepsons, three grandchildren and a sister.       
         Fedora Barbieri, a dramatic mezzo-soprano celebrated for Verdi interpretations that were extensively preserved on records and film, died on Tuesday in Florence, Italy. She was 82.         Gifted with a large, opulent voice, Miss Barbieri was of the same generation of opera stars as Cesare Siepi, Giuseppe di Stefano, Boris Christoff and Jussi Bjorling. A favorite with European audiences from the 1940's on, she later won acclaim in New York, particularly for her appearances as Azucena in ''Il Trovatore,'' Amneris in ''Aida,'' Adalgisa in Bellini's ''Norma,'' and in the Verdi Requiem.         Her 1950 New York debut itself entered opera history, coming on the night Rudolf Bing first faced his audience as the general manager of the Metropolitan Opera. He opened an era with a boldly ambitious revival of ''Don Carlo,'' in which Miss Barbieri sang the role of Princess Eboli.         The Immigration and Naturalization Service had turned Bing's entire inaugural season into a cliffhanger days before the curtain rose on it. Acting under the 1950 Internal Security Act, it confined shiploads of arriving aliens on Ellis Island on the grounds that they could be threats to the United States; Miss Barbieri, Christoff and Zinka Milanov were among them.         Miss Barbieri's offense was attending school in Fascist wartime Italy, a circumstance that she stated in her visa application. She and the other soloists were freed just in time for the show to go on.         Miss Barbieri, Mr. Bjorling (in the title role) and Mr. Siepi, making his debut as Philip II, appeared in what Olin Downes of The New York Times described as an occasion that revealed afresh ''the melodic opulence and dramatic power of Verdi's genius.'' Miss Barbieri, he said, was a ''superb mezzo from Italy, with a kindling dramatic temperament.''         Fedora Barbieri was born in Trieste, Italy, and as a girl she helped out in her parents' shop. Intrigued by her casual singing, a customer suggested that she study voice formally.         She made her professional debut in 1940 as Fidalma in Cimarosa's ''Matrimonio Segreto.'' She sang her first Azucena the next night and repeated Fidalma the night after that, a feat that quickly established her reputation in Europe as a masterly interpreter of the Italian repertory at its most demanding.         She sang in Rome, made her debut at La Scala in 1943, sang in South America and went to London with La Scala in 1950. She made an immediate impression at Covent Garden, singing Mistress Quickly in ''Falstaff,'' and giving one of her stirring performances in the Requiem.         She remained a regular at La Scala and sang at the Metropolitan primarily in the 1950's and 60's. Of her many Verdi roles, she favored Eboli in her earlier years, but later leaned toward the lower registers of Azucena and Amneris. She finally found Mistress Quickly best attuned to her voice. Her repertory included 109 roles.         Miss Barbieri married Luigi Barlozzetti, a music director, who managed her career. He died about a decade ago. She is survived by sons Ugo and Franco, both of Florence.         Miss Barbieri paid a final visit to New York in the fall. On Nov. 2 she sang a brief a cappella solo at the Licia Albanese-Puccini Foundation gala at Alice Tully Hall. She also conducted master classes at the Juilliard School and the Manhattan School of Music, and sat for an interview at the Mayflower Hotel with Stefan Zucker, the director of the Bel Canto Society, a nonprofit marketer of vintage opera videos.       
         Barbara Doyle Duncan, who collected, exhibited and wrote about modern Latin American art when the field was still little known to much of the United States art world, died on March 28 at her home in New York. She was 82.         Ms. Duncan's interest in Latin American art began when she and her husband, John C. Duncan, a businessman, lived in Lima, Peru, from 1947 to 1955. There, and on quick trips elsewhere, she met artists and bought their work.         In New York in the 1960's, she earned a master's degree at the Institute of Fine Arts, for which she wrote two theses, one on colonial Peruvian religious art, the other on the painter Joaquín Torres-García (1874-1949).         In 1977 she organized the influential exhibition ''Recent Latin American Drawings (1969-1976): Lines of Vision,'' which included 100 artists, and in 1985 she organized another important show, ''Gloria in Excelsis: The Virgin and Angels in Viceregal Painting of Peru and Bolivia.'' Each exhibition appeared at the Americas Society in Manhattan.         In 1979 she helped plan the first auction of Latin American art at Sotheby's in New York. It was an unexpected success and did much to give that art a wider public and institutional presence.         She and her husband donated their collection, considered one of the best ensembles of post-1960's Latin American work in the United States, to the Archer M. Huntington Art Gallery (now the Jack S. Blanton Museum of Art) at the University of Texas, Austin, to which Ms. Duncan also gave a substantial collection of archival material.         In addition to being on the board of directors of the Americas Society, she was a life trustee of the International House, New York; and a director of the International Council of the Museum of Modern Art.         In an interview in the catalog for the 1997 exhibition ''Realigning Vision: Alternative Currents in South American Drawing,'' organized by the University of Texas on the model of one of her earlier shows, she said that what she found distinctive about the art to which she had devoted her attention was its ''reluctance to give up the subject of the human condition.''         Ms. Duncan is survived by her husband of 62 years, who lives in New York; a son, Craig Duncan, of Greenwich, Conn; two daughters, Lynn Tarbox of Tampa, Fla., and Gail Simmons of New York; five grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.       
         Vera Zorina, a dancer and actress who starred in ballets, films and stage musicals choreographed by her first husband, George Balanchine, and whose mix of glamour and culture made her prominent in a variety of theatrical and musical fields, died on Wednesday at her home in Santa Fe, N.M. She was 86.         Ms. Zorina and the harpsichordist Paul Wolfe, whom she married after the death her second husband, Goddard Lieberson, the president of CBS Records, moved in 1990 to Santa Fe, where she continued a career as an opera director for several troupes, including the Santa Fe Opera.         Newer audiences saw her as a performer-narrator in dramatic oratorios. Public television captured her as the narrator in ''Persephone'' in the New York City Ballet's 1982 Stravinsky Festival, organized by Balanchine the year before he died.         Movie audiences, however, cherished other images of her. In the 1938 film ''The Goldwyn Follies,'' Balanchine made use of Ms. Zorina's outright sex appeal as well as her arabesques when he cast her as a nymph in a wet, clinging tunic, rising out of a pool. Other audience favorites include her role as a dancer opposite Bob Hope in ''Louisiana Purchase'' in 1941, adapted from a Broadway show choreographed by Balanchine.         Although Balanchine was considered the genius behind much of Ms. Zorina's success onstage and screen in the 1930's and 1940's (they were divorced in 1946), she was better known to the general public than he was in 1938, when they went to Hollywood to work for Sam Goldwyn.         Goldwyn was smitten with Ms. Zorina, who had been Léonide Massine's protégée in the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo. She had also starred in the 1937 London production of the musical ''On Your Toes.''         Whether Ms. Zorina insisted that Goldwyn hire Balanchine for ''The Goldwyn Follies,'' or whether Goldwyn brought them together, the collaboration ended in Ms. Zorina's marriage to Balanchine in December 1938. By all accounts, it was an unhappy union. Mostly, it embodied an experiment that integrated high art into popular culture. Ms. Zorina's films, in which she often played a dancer, did much to introduce audiences to ballet as an art form, one that was witty and contemporary.         Ms. Zorina was herself a product of an artistic milieu. She was born Eva Brigitta Hartwig on Jan. 2, 1917, in Berlin. Her mother, a Norwegian, and her father, a German, were both professional singers. Her parents separated when she was 6, at the time she began studying ballet with Evgenia Eduardova and Victor Gsovsky. At 14, she played a fairy in Max Reinhardt's celebrated production of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' and she performed in Reinhardt's 1931 ''Tales of Hoffman.''         After moving to London to study ballet, she had her first success in the West End in 1933: Anton Dolin, the British ballet star, cast her opposite himself in ''Ballerina,'' a play with ballet interludes.         Although friends called her Brigitta throughout her life, her professional name was changed to Vera Zorina by Colonel de Basil, as the director of the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo was known. He invited her to join the company in 1934.         As she wrote in her 1986 autobiography, ''Zorina,'' she became involved at 18 in an open ménage à trois that included Massine, then the world's best-known choreographer, and his wife, Eugenia Delarova.         Massine cast her in his ballets: she was the Street Dancer in ''Le Beau Danube'' and Action in ''Les Présages.'' But Ms. Zorina also cherished her performances in Bronislava Nijinska's experimental masterpiece to Stravinsky, ''Les Noces.''         After leaving the ballet company in 1936 and succeeding in the London production of ''On Your Toes,'' she divided her time between Broadway and Hollywood. While she was under contract to M.G.M. from 1938 to 1944, her films included a version of ''On Your Toes, as well as ''I Was an Adventuress'' and ''Star-Spangled Rhythm.'' Some, like ''Follow the Boys,'' did not involve Balanchine, but she collaborated with him in Broadway musicals, including ''I Married an Angel'' and ''Dream With Music,'' and for her role as Ariel in Shakespeare's ''Tempest.'' In 1943, she tried to return to a serious ballet career and was a guest artist with Ballet Theater, where Balanchine cast her as Terpsichore, the leading muse in his ''Apollo.''         In 1946, Ms. Zorina married Mr. Lieberson, who died in 1977. They had two sons, Jonathan, a philosophy teacher, who died in 1989, and the composer Peter Liberson, also of Santa Fe. In addition to Peter Liberson and Mr. Wolfe, whom she married 12 years ago, she is survived by three granddaughters.         Correction:  April 14, 2003, Monday  An obituary on Saturday about the dancer and actress Vera Zorina misspelled the surname of one of her sons. He is Peter Lieberson, not Liberson.       
         Muriel Topaz, the former director of the Dance Notation Bureau and the dance division of the Juilliard School, and an authority on the choreography of Antony Tudor, died on Monday at the Connecticut Hospice in Branford. She was 70 and lived in Milford, Conn.         The cause was liver disease, said her son, Daniel Druckman.         Though trained as a performer and choreographer, a passion for preserving dances through notation dominated much of Ms. Topaz's career.         In a polemical statement to the 1982 conference of the Dance Critics Association in New York, she asked, ''Is choreography an evanescent form existing only in the bodies and personalities of the initial performers, or does it, like all other performing art forms, have a substance, a compositional integrity that transcends the initial performance?''         ''For surely, if it does,'' she continued, ''there can be no question of our obligation to document and pass on that art form to future generations.''         She championed the notation system known as Labanotation (invented by Rudolf von Laban in the 1920's), yet she urged choreographers to record dances in any way that might be comprehensible to others. In an interview with The New York Times in 1985, she said, ''Most of the revivals we see are possible only because someone at some time wrote something down.''         Ms. Topaz's convictions led her to notate works by more than 25 choreographers, including such diverse figures as George Balanchine, Gower Champion, Isadora Duncan, Martha Graham, Doris Humphrey, José Limón, Jerome Robbins, Paul Taylor and Tudor.         She felt a special affinity for Tudor, the British-born choreographer who created major productions for American Ballet Theater. Last year, she published a study of his achievements, ''Undimmed Luster: The Life of Antony Tudor'' (Scarecrow Press), and at the time of her death she was reconstructing as much as possible of ''The Planets,'' a legendary Tudor ballet that has not been performed since the 1940's.         Ms. Topaz was born in Philadelphia. She studied ballet and modern dance there and at New York University and Juilliard. She retained close ties to Juilliard, serving as the rehearsal director of the Juilliard Dance Ensemble from 1966 to 1970 and directing its dance divison from 1985 to 1992, succeeding Martha Hill, the department's founder.         Long associated with the Dance Notation Bureau in New York, Ms. Topaz was director of its Labanotation studies from 1970 to 1978 and its excutive director from 1978 to 1985. She also organized international notation conferences in Tel Aviv (1984) and Hong Kong (1990).         Ms. Topaz received a John Simon Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship in 1998, served as a panelist for many cultural organizations, including the Massachusetts Cultural Council and the New York State State Council on the Arts, and was an auditor for the National Endowment for the Arts. She adjudicated dance festivals across America and frequently wrote for dance publications.         Ms. Topaz's husband, the composer Jacob Druckman, died in 1996. In addition to her son, of Orangeburg, N.Y., she is survived by a daughter, Karen S. Jeanneret-Druckman, of Rolle, Switzerland, and three grand-daughters.       
         Celine G. Marcus, former executive director of the Lenox Hill Neighborhood Association, an East Side social services organization, died on Thursday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 93.         She retired in 1982 after 12 years as the association's executive director and 11 years as assistant to the director.         She spent those 23 years helping to create a network of social services in the association's neighborhood, from 59th to 96th Streets and Fifth Avenue to the East River.         She became the head of a staff of 255, 180 of them volunteers, and addressed problems including crime, truancy, loneliness and aging. The organization is now called the Lenox Hill Neighborhood House.         In 1980, she was a founder of the Neighborhood Coalition for Shelter, which works to provide shelter and other help for Manhattan's homeless.         She was on the boards of the Yorkville Civic Center and several other groups.         In 1983 she was one of the first five winners of the Family of New York Awards, fostered by former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.         She and her co-winners were honored for helping to establish a community shelter for homeless women. They also led efforts to aid homeless men at a city-run shelter in the Seventh Regiment Armory, at Park Avenue and 66th Street.         Born in Brooklyn, Celine Greenebaum graduated from Barnard. Her social-services career began on the Lower East Side in the Depression and lasted more than 50 years.         Her husband, Joshua Marcus, died in 1988. She is survived by two daughters, Ann Marcus of Manhattan and Dorothy Marcus of the Bronx; a son, Daniel, of Washington; five grandchildren; six great-grandchildren; and two sisters, Marion Epstein of Princeton, N.J., and Helen Joffe of Rochester.       
         Franchellie Margaret Cadwell, one of the first women to own a national advertising agency and a strong advocate of change in the image of women in advertisements, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 70.         The cause was brain cancer, said her friend and financial adviser Richard L. Koenigsberg.         Known in the advertising world as Frankie, Ms. Cadwell used her prominent position to press for changes in how women and older people appeared in advertising.         ''Advertising makes women look as if they have the mentality of a 6-year-old, or else they're suffering from brain damage,'' Ms. Cadwell said at a luncheon in 1970.         That year Ms. Cadwell polled more than 600 women visiting Disneyland on their most-hated commercials, producing a list of spots for products like Scope mouthwash and Bold detergent that the women found insulting. She argued that women could better be persuaded to buy products by presenting interesting facts about the products, and she urged women to avoid buying products with poor or degrading advertising.         She also represented clients in the fashion and cosmetics businesses, saying that women liked to feel beautiful. One of the most familiar lines from campaigns for her clients defended the synthetic nature of Dynel, an imitation fur, by saying: ''It's not fake anything, it's real Dynel.''         Ms. Cadwell also helped develop advertising for the introduction of the Reach toothbrush from Johnson & Johnson, a forerunner of today's heavily advertised toothbrush brands. The Reach campaigns for many years included a character with a comically oversized mouth.         Franchellie Margaret Cadwell was born on April 23, 1933, in Hamilton, Bermuda. She earned a bachelor's degree at Cornell University, where she later helped found the President's Council of Cornell Women, and an M.B.A. in marketing at the New York University Graduate School of Business.         She left her first advertising agency, Trahey/Cadwell, in the early 1960's to form Cadwell Davis, a boutique subsidiary of Compton Advertising, with Ms. Cadwell as president and Hal Davis as creative director.         For more than 20 years, the agency worked on various accounts for Johnson & Johnson, including O.B. Tampons and Act mouth rinse.         Saatchi & Saatchi acquired Compton in 1982; Ms. Cadwell and a later partner, Herman Davis, bought back the agency, by then known as Cadwell Davis Partners, in 1994. It closed last fall after Ms. Cadwell had been sick for more than a year.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Martha Scott, who created the role of the sweet, ethereal Emily in the original Broadway production of Thornton Wilder's ''Our Town'' and was nominated for an Oscar for repeating it in the film version, died on Wednesday in Los Angeles. She was 88.         Miss Scott's trademark was warm sincerity in an era when glamour-girl artificiality reigned. She appeared in more than 20 movies, at least that many Broadway productions and a variety of television shows. She also produced plays and movies.         She loved to point out that she had played Charlton Heston's mother twice in films, in ''The Ten Commandments'' (1957) and ''Ben-Hur'' (1959) and his wife twice onstage: in ''Design for a Stained Glass Window'' (1950) and ''The Tumbler'' (1960).         But her most sparkling accomplishment was when, as a 23-year-old novice, she was chosen at the last minute for the part of Emily Webb in ''Our Town,'' Wilder's classic about the cycles of birth, love and death in Grovers Corners, a small New England town.         A previous actress had been fired for not capturing the character in the final act, when Emily appears after death.         In an interview with The New York Times in 1969, Miss Scott recalled her brief audition with Jed Harris, the original producer and director of ''Our Town.'' He was desperate because the play was about to open in Princeton, N.J.; she had been recommended for the part by several of his colleagues.         ''He just pushed back my hair, looked at me and said, 'You've got the job,' '' she said. ''Then he said, 'How many years' experience have you had?' I told him five years. He said, 'You're gonna get a chance to prove it.' ''         She did. In his review in The Times in February 1938, Brooks Atkinson praised her interaction with John Craven, who played her husband, saying, ''Some of their scenes are lovely past all enduring.''         She was also praised for her performance as Emily in the film version, but lost the Academy Award to Ginger Rogers, who won for ''Kitty Foyle.''         In 1940, Miss Scott also appeared in ''The Howards of Virginia,'' which many critics consider Cary Grant's worst movie. Her other films included ''In Old Oklahoma'' (1943) with John Wayne and ''The Desperate Hours'' (1955) with Humphrey Bogart.         Martha Ellen Scott was born on Sept. 22, 1914, in Jamesport, Mo. Her father later opened a garage in Gallatin, Mo., and went on to become an engineer for a paint firm in Kansas City. Her parents disapproved of acting, but a sympathetic aunt reportedly lent her $2,500 so she could study acting at the University of Michigan. She repaid the loan.         She then appeared in Shakespearean parts at the 1933-34 Chicago World's Fair. By the winter of 1937-38, she was making the rounds in Manhattan and was asked to audition for the role of Emily.         Miss Scott's long career kept veering back to the stage, which she loved best. In 1991, she played the doomed Rebecca Nurse in ''The Crucible,'' the first production of Tony Randall's National Actors Theater in New York.         Among her many television roles were Sue Ellen Ewing's mother on ''Dallas'' and a mysterious grandmother on ''General Hospital.''         She also produced plays. In 1968, she joined Henry Fonda and Robert Ryan in forming the Plumstead Playhouse, which produced classical revivals with all-star casts in New York. It later became the Plumstead Theater company in Los Angeles.         Her first marriage, to Carlton Alsop, a radio and film producer, ended in divorce in 1946. She later married the composer Mel Powell, who died in 1998.         She is survived by her son, Scott Alsop; her daughters Mary Powell Harpel and Kathleen Powell; and her brother, Charles Scott.         Miss Scott asked to be buried in the cemetery in Jamesport, where she rehearsed Emily's graveyard scene.       
         Dr. Judianne Densen-Gerber, a lawyer and psychiatrist who founded the drug treatment program Odyssey House and went on to give widely quoted but sometimes disputed testimony on subjects like child abuse and pornography, died on Sunday in Manhattan. She was 68.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter Dr. Sarah Baden, who added that her mother lived in Westport, Conn., and had come to New York for Mother's Day.         In 1966, Dr. Densen-Gerber founded Odyssey House, one of the earlier drug-free therapeutic communities that helped addicts recover. She was a leading advocate of such programs, which involved group residence and group therapy, as opposed to methadone-maintenance programs.         She got to know Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller when she picketed in front of his house to demand funds for her program, and they became friends. In the 1970's she became a conspicuous figure at public hearings, society balls and ghetto demonstrations with her bouffant hairdo, rhinestone-studded glasses and cigars.         A 1979 profile in New York magazine quoted Mayor Edward I. Koch as saying that she was ''one of those seminal forces, original, a go-getter.'' He said there were ''few people who can claim as many accomplishments.''         Dr. Densen-Gerber's success at getting government help became her downfall when the state investigated her use of public funds in the early 1980's and found irregularities. She resigned as executive director of Odyssey House in 1983, but remained active in affiliated programs.         Her influence extended to areas like child pornography. In 1977, her testimony that there were 264 monthly publications devoted to the subject helped persuade the House of Representatives to unanimously pass a bill to regulate it.         IPT, the publication of the Institute for Psychological Therapy, reported in 1992 that later government investigations proved her estimates to be exaggerated by ''several orders of magnitude.''         Dr. Densen-Gerber also commented on many other hot issues from a psychiatric point of view.         In 1991, she went to Omaha to testify in court that her interview with a man convinced her he had witnessed four satanic ritual killings. She characterized herself as an expert at deprogramming survivors of satanic cults.         In 1997, she appeared on Geraldo Rivera's television program to analyze a videotape of JonBenet Ramsey in a children's beauty contest.         Her unorthodox approach extended to her psychiatric practice. In 1999, she agreed to pay $200,000 to settle a civil lawsuit over her inability to account for 1,270 vials of medicinal cocaine. She denied any violation of the law.         She was born in Manhattan on Nov. 13, 1934. Her mother, Beatrice Densen, who had kept her own name, was an heiress of the Densen paper-box fortune. Her father, Gustave Gerber, a chemical engineer, became a lawyer in his 40's and was considering studying medicine in his 60's.         Dr. Densen-Gerber's parents persuaded her to study law before supporting her through medical school. She graduated from Columbia Law School and New York University Medical School. She did her residency at Metropolitan Hospital, where during one of her pregnancies, the director suggested she spend an hour or two a day working with addicts. That led to her assembling, in 1966, a group of addicts who wanted to cure themselves without using drugs. Before she found a home for them, they slept in 11 temporary shelters, giving rise to the name Odyssey.         Her original capital was $3.82, and dinner was often rice and spaghetti. Her first permanent building, on East 109th Street, was rented for $17 a month. There were 17 residents.         Within four years, other Odyssey Houses had started to spring up in other cities. In New York, Dr. Densen-Gerber reached out to new populations like prostitutes and addicted mothers.         Her own celebrity grew, and in 1981 The New York Times noted her costume at the April in Paris Ball at the Waldorf-Astoria. She wore a leather lionlike mask and a lionlike coiffure.         By the next year, Dr. Densen-Gerber faced stiff challenges. She agreed to pay back $20,000 in excessive personal expenses to close a state investigation. News reports suggested she had become intoxicated with her own power.         ''I remember her grandly lying back and being grande dame to all the peons who were lying around,'' Nancy Hoving, a former member of Odyssey's advisory council, said in a New York magazine interview.         In 1997, her marriage to Michael Baden, who had been the city's medical examiner and a top forensic official for the state police, burned out in a flurry of lawsuits and spectacular accusations.         The marriage's beginning had also been unusual. Mr. Baden said in an interview with The Daily News in 1989 that he took her to an autopsy on their first date and proposed by phone while assisting in the post-mortem on the bullet-riddled body of the mobster Albert Anastasia.         In addition to her daughter Sarah, Dr. Densen-Gerber is survived by another daughter, Trissa Baden of Hopewell, N.J.; a son, Lindsey, of Brookline, Mass.; and two grandchildren.       
         June Carter Cash, a singer, songwriter and actress and the wife and collaborator of Johnny Cash, died yesterday in Nashville. She was 73.         She had been critically ill since having surgery at Baptist Hospital on May 7 to replace a heart valve.         Of all her accomplishments, the best known is probably the hit song ''Ring of Fire,'' which is about falling in love with Johnny Cash, and which he performed. Ms. Cash wrote the song with Merle Kilgore in 1963, long before her marriage to Mr. Cash in 1968 but after she had become close to him, working with him on cross-country tours. Instead of the usual seraphic love language of teen-angels, it used images of suffering and hellfire and is probably the most complicated popular love song in country music.         Valerie June Carter Cash was born into the Carter Family, the most important of the early country music groups, and one that helped changed it from a string-based music to a vocal music. Her mother was Mother Maybelle Carter, who sang and played guitar on songs like ''Single Girl, Married Girl'' and ''I'm Thinking Tonight of My Blue Eyes,'' some of the most important recordings of early commercial country music in the late 1920's.         She first lived in Maces Spring, Va., the hometown of her father, Ezra Carter, a farmer. But when she was 10 the family moved to Texas to be near the high-watt radio station XERA in Del Rio, Tex., where they performed on regular radio shows.         By the late 1930's she was performing with the group on records, radio shows and stages. At its largest, the group included Ms. Cash, her sisters Helen and Anita, her cousin Janette, her mother, and her mother's cousins Sara and A. P. Carter. June Carter had her own feature numbers, like ''Engine 143,'' which she sang in a wobbly but vigorously open-throated girl's voice, accompanying herself on autoharp.         The original Carter Family group dissolved in 1943. Ms. Cash, her sisters and her mother began touring and recording as Mother Maybelle and the Carter Sisters. June was the most outgoing of the group, a comedian as well as singer, and the shows mixed traditional songs of the Carter Family (like ''Will the Circle Be Unbroken'') with pop, gospel and vaudeville comedy. June created a routine involving a deep-country character named Aunt Polly.         By 1946 the group had developed a substantial audience through regular appearances on the ''Old Dominion Barn Dance'' program broadcast over WNOX in Knoxville. She crossed over to the pop charts with a hit song, ''Baby It's Cold Outside,'' recorded in 1949 with the comedy duo Homer and Jethro.         By 1950 Mother Maybelle and the Carter Sisters were regulars at Nashville's Grand Ole Opry. It was there that Ms. Cash met Elvis Presley, as well as two of her future husbands, the singer Carl Smith, and then Mr. Cash.         In her brief union with Mr. Smith she had two daughters, Carlene and Rozanna. She is also survived by her son with Johnny Cash, John Carter Cash; her stepchildren Rosanne, Tara, Kathy and Cindy; and several grandchildren.         In 1955 and 1956, the director Elia Kazan saw her perform and encouraged her to try stage acting. Newly separated, Ms. Cash took the advice, studying with Lee Strasberg and with Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York and staying with the Kazan family; on weekends she flew home to Nashville with her young daughters to perform at the Opry.         In the mid-50's she was managed by Colonel Tom Parker and toured with Elvis Presley. It was Presley who first told her about Johnny Cash, intriguing her with his description of how he managed to command an audience onstage while staying perfectly still. She and Mr. Cash finally met in 1956 backstage at the Grand Ole Opry, and she has written of an instant mutual fascination.         In liner notes for Mr. Cash's ''Love, God, Murder,'' she described his eyes. ''Those black eyes that shone like agates,'' she wrote. ''I only glanced into them because I believed that I would be drawn into his soul and I would never have been able to walk away.'' In ''I Still Miss Someone,'' from 1958, he sang, ''I never got over those blue eyes/I see them everywhere.''         By 1961, June Carter was married to her second husband, Rip Nix, and Maybelle and the Carter Sisters (renamed the Carter Family after the death of the original family's patriarch, A. P. Carter, in 1960) became part of Johnny Cash's touring show. She stuck to an old-fashioned, wholesome image, while Mr. Cash was becoming famous for drug taking, onstage swearing and explosions of temper. It was the worst period of Mr. Cash's addiction to barbiturates and amphetamines.         Ms. Cash was one of his closest confidantes, and she began hiding and throwing away his pills. She finally helped him to find counseling, and Mr. Cash often credited her thereafter with saving his life.         In 1967 they made an album together, ''Carryin' On,'' including the duet ''Jackson,'' which was a No. 1 pop hit and won a Grammy. (They won another Grammy for their duet ''If I Were a Carpenter'' in 1970.) Soon after, they became engaged.         Once married to Mr. Cash, she became a fixture in his show, telling jokes and singing, often appearing in antique lace dresses amid the silk and sequins and tasseled suits that were the standard outfits for country stars well into the 1970's. In the 1970's she also acted, and took roles on ''Gunsmoke'' and ''Little House on the Prairie,'' among other programs. She wrote a memoir, ''Among My Klediments,'' in 1979, and a book of autobiographical vignettes, ''From the Heart,'' in 1987.         She acted little after her marriage to Mr. Cash, but appeared in Robert Duvall's film ''The Apostle'' in 1997, playing the mother of Mr. Duvall's character. In 1999 she released her second solo album, ''Press On,'' a rough, unostentatious, charming record, which won a Grammy. It included songs from the Carter Family repertory as well as a new arrangement of ''Ring of Fire'' and several of her own songs, like ''Tiffany Anastasia Lowe,'' a song admonishing her granddaughter of the dangers of Hollywood life.         She and Mr. Cash divided their time between a house at the base of the Clinch Mountains in Virginia and estates in Nashville and Jamaica. Mr. Cash was seriously ill recently with diabetes and pneumonia.         Correction:  May 17, 2003, Saturday  An obituary of the country music singer and songwriter June Carter Cash yesterday misidentified the father of one of her children, Rozanna Cash. He was Rip Nix, her second husband, not Carl Smith, her first. The obituary also referred incorrectly to the recording of the song ''Jackson'' in 1967 by Ms. Cash and her third husband, Johnny Cash. While it did win a Grammy, it was not a No. 1 hit; the version of the song that became a hit on the Billboard top 40 chart was recorded by Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazlewood, also in 1967.       
         The Rev. Shirley Bulah Stamps, whose parents' fight for her to ride a school bus became part of the 1954 Supreme Court case that ended school segregation, died on Wednesday in Wilmington, Del. She was 59.         The cause was a heart attack, The Associated Press reported.         Shirley Bulah was 8 when her parents, Fred and Sarah, grew tired of driving her two miles to a black school in Hockessin, Del., a suburb of Wilmington. Each day, a bus went right by their home on its way to a far better white school.         In 1951, with the help of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Bulahs sued not just for a bus ride; they also asked a state court for admission to the white school.         They won, and for the first time, a segregated white public school was ordered by an American court to admit black children. Thurgood Marshall, then director of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, called it ''the first real victory in our campaign to destroy segregation.''         After the decision was upheld by the Delaware Supreme Court, an appeal by the state board of education reached the United States Supreme Court, as part of a bundle of cases from Kansas, South Carolina, Virginia, the District of Columbia and Delaware. Together the cases became known as Oliver L. Brown, et al., v. the Board of Education of Topeka. The Delaware case was unique in that all the other state courts had upheld segregation.         The decision of the court was unanimous in ending school segregation in the United States. The opinion, written by Chief Justice Earl Warren, repeatedly cited the reasoning and language of Collins Jacques Seitz, the Delaware judge who presided over the Bulahs' case.         Shirley was adopted by the Bulahs after Sarah Bulah read in the Wilmington newspapers in 1945 about an abandoned 10-month-old baby, according to Richard Kluger in his book, ''Simple Justice: The History of Brown v. Board of Education and Black America's Struggle for Equality'' (Knopf, 1976). Her husband, who worked as a foreman in a paper mill, had eight children, four of whom survived into adulthood, from his first marriage, but Mrs. Bulah was in her 50's and childless.         When Mrs. Bulah wrote to state education authorities to complain about the lack of a bus for her child, she was eventually told that the state constitution required racially segregated educational facilities and that buses fell under that definition.         Mrs. Bulah went to Louis L. Redding, a lawyer for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the first black admitted to the Delaware bar.         ''He said he wouldn't help me get a Jim Crow bus to take my girl to any Jim Crow school,'' Mrs. Bulah told Mr. Kluger, ''but if I was interested in sendin' her to an integrated school, why, then maybe he'd help. Well, I thanked God right then and there.''         Mr. Kluger wrote that many blacks in the area were upset with the legal action because they had no desire to associate with white people. But Shirley was welcomed by her new white classmates.         ''They came to my birthday parties at my house, and I went to theirs,'' she said in an interview with The News Journal of Wilmington in April. ''I didn't have to worry about being punched or worry about getting gum in my hair.''         After graduating from high school, the News Journal reported, she was a nurse in the military, where she met Phillip E. Stamps. They married, and when he retired they moved to Maryland. He died in 1996 and she moved back to Delaware.         She was ordained as a minister in 1984 and was pastor of four churches, the last the St. James African Union Methodist Church in Wilmington.         She is survived by her son, Phillip Jr., of Baltimore, and three grandchildren.       
         Katharine Hepburn, the actress whose independent life and strong-willed movie characters made her a role model for generations of women and a beloved heroine to filmgoers for more than 60 years, died yesterday at her home in the Fenwick section of Old Saybrook, Conn. She was 96 and also had a home in Manhattan.         Her physical presence was distinctive, her often-imitated voice filled with the vowels of a well-bred New Englander, and her sharp-planed face defined by remarkably high cheekbones. In her youth she did not have classical leading-lady looks, but a handsome beauty. In old age she was a familiar figure with her hair, gradually changing from auburn to gray, always in a topknot and her boyish figure always in the trousers that she helped to make fashionable.         She played sharp-witted, sophisticated women with an ease that suggested that there was a thin line between the movie role and the off-screen personality. The romantic comedy ''The Philadelphia Story'' and the screwball classic ''Bringing Up Baby'' were among her best, most typical roles. But through 43 films and dozens of stage and television appearances, she played comic and dramatic parts as varied as Jo in ''Little Women,'' the reborn spinster Rosie in ''The African Queen'' and Eleanor of Aquitaine in ''The Lion in Winter.''         Her life and career were dominated by her love affair with Spencer Tracy, which created one of the great romantic legends and brilliant movie pairings of their day. Tracy was unhappily married and the father of two when they met, and he remained married until the end of his life. He and Miss Hepburn lived together for 27 years, until his death in 1967, and made nine films together.         ''Woman of the Year,'' ''Adam's Rib'' and ''Pat and Mike'' are typically bright and biting Tracy-Hepburn collaborations. She is wickedly smart, slightly aloof and emotionally vulnerable. He is commonsensical, down-to-earth and deeply decent. He manages to bring her down a peg; she never minds.         Hepburn and Tracy, Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times, ''so beautifully complemented each other'' that their relationship ''never seemed to be a matter of capitulation.'' Rather, he added, it was ''a matter of understanding and acknowledging each other's boundaries.''         The frisson of their off-screen romance, always hinted at but never acknowledged during his lifetime, followed them on screen and became especially poignant when they played a married couple in their last movie together, ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.'' Tracy died just 17 days after they had finished filming it.         Through most of her career, Miss Hepburn had a reputation for being private and elusive with the press. In fact, she frequently granted interviews, although she was reticent about her personal life. But after the death of Tracy's wife, Louise, in 1983, Miss Hepburn felt free to discuss the love affair.         In later years she spoke openly about her life and career, especially in her 1991 autobiography, ''Me: Stories of My Life'' (Alfred A. Knopf). Although admittedly sketchy rather than a comprehensive memoir, the book captured the qualities that endeared Miss Hepburn to audiences: a conversational tone, a no-nonsense attitude and disarming candor. The autobiography became a best seller, a tribute to her enduring appeal across generational lines.         In 1993 she appeared in an autobiographical television documentary, ''Katharine Hepburn: All About Me,'' made for the TNT cable network. She began: ''So this is about Katharine Hepburn, public, private. Can you tell which is which?'' She added, laughing, ''Sometimes I wonder myself.''         Longing to Be a Boy         Katharine Houghton Hepburn was born into a close family whose comfortable social status and unconventional opinions fostered self-confidence and independence. Her father, Dr. Thomas Norval Hepburn, was a Hartford surgeon and a pioneer in fighting venereal disease. Her mother, Katharine Houghton, was a suffragist and a strong advocate of birth control.         In ''Me,'' Miss Hepburn finally revealed her age. ''I was born May 12, 1907,'' she wrote, ''despite everything I may have said to the contrary.'' For years she had said she was two years younger and had given her birthday as Nov. 8. That was the birthday of her older brother, Tom, who died at 16. Miss Hepburn, then 14, found his body hanging from the rafters of a house the family was visiting in New York City. The Hepburns said they never knew whether he had committed suicide and left open the possibility that he had been practicing a magic trick.         Although the family always called her Kathy or Kath, one summer Miss Hepburn so hated being a little girl that she cut her hair and called herself Jimmy. ''I thought being a girl was really the bunk,'' she said in an interview. ''But there's no bunk about Jimmy.''         After graduating from Bryn Mawr College in 1928, she had small parts in stock theater companies. She was dismissed from more than one play when she was starting out, but she retained supreme self-confidence. Late in life, she laughingly said of her younger self, ''I am terribly afraid I just assumed I'd be famous.''         She was first noticed professionally in her role as Antiope in the play ''The Warrior's Husband,'' a Greek fable in which she entered by descending a narrow staircase, carrying a stag over her shoulder.         That role led to a Hollywood screen test and her first film role, as John Barrymore's daughter in ''A Bill of Divorcement'' (1932). It was directed by George Cukor, who become one of her dearest friends (she and Tracy lived for years in the guest house on Cukor's Hollywood estate) and the director of many of her films, including ''Little Women.'' He once recalled of her screen test: ''She was unlike anybody I'd ever seen or heard. I was rather moved by the test, although the performance wasn't that good. But I thought, 'That girl is rather interesting.' ''         Fast Rise to Stardom         Miss Hepburn became a movie star quickly. She won an Academy Award for her role as Eva Lovelace, the naïve aspiring actress who learns a tough lesson about survival, in the 1933 film ''Morning Glory,'' only her third movie. Over the years she was nominated for a dozen Oscars, a record unbeaten until Meryl Streep received her 13th nomination this year. Miss Hepburn won three more, for ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,'' ''The Lion in Winter'' and ''On Golden Pond,'' but never showed up to collect any of them.         When she was 84, she looked back at those early days and, with her trademark tough-mindedness, said: ''In the beginning I had money; I wasn't a poor little thing. I don't know what I would have done if I'd had to come to New York and get a job as a waiter or something like that. I think I'm a success, but I had every advantage; I should have been.''         She also credited her husband with helping her get started in her career. For most of her life, the public thought she had never married. In fact, in 1928 she married Ludlow Ogden Smith, a member of a wealthy Pennsylvania family. She immediately made him change his name to S. Ogden Ludlow, partly because she didn't want to be known as Kate Smith.         They led separate lives long before their divorce in 1934, but they remained friendly. The town house they bought together in the Turtle Bay section of Manhattan was Miss Hepburn's home until the end of her life (along with the family home on the Connecticut River, to which she returned often).         In later years she expressed regret at the way she had treated her husband. In an interview that echoed what she wrote in ''Me,'' she assumed a self-chastising, no-nonsense tone and said she had been ''an absolute pig with Luddy, absolute pig.'' She continued: ''He was an angel. I thought of myself first, and that's a pig, isn't it?''         ''I would have been terrified alone in New York City,'' she said. ''We bought this house in '31, and then the minute I won the Academy Award, I got rid of Luddy.'' Many years later, not long before he died, ''I tried to make up to him for the horror I had caused him,'' she added. ''He was so generous-spirited that I don't think he considered it horror. He just considered it a kid who was wildly ambitious or something.''         Miss Hepburn is survived by a brother, Dr. Robert H. Hepburn, and a sister, Margaret H. Perry, both of Canton, Conn.; four nieces; and nine nephews.         Trousers as a Trademark         Despite her early success, reviewers in those days sometimes found her strident and mannered. In 1933 she returned to Broadway in a spectacular failure, ''The Lake,'' which inspired Dorothy Parker to write her famous aphorism, ''She ran the gamut of emotion from A to B.''         Of those early years, she said: ''I strike people as peculiar in some way, although I don't quite understand why. Of course, I have an angular face, an angular body and, I suppose, an angular personality, which jabs into people.''         Over time her screen presence softened and became more likable; meanwhile, society was catching up to her willful, independent style. She had been wearing pants, then considered quite unladylike, since the 1930's.         In her 1993 television autobiography, she recalled: ''I realized long ago that skirts are hopeless. Anytime I hear a man say he prefers a woman in a skirt, I say: 'Try one. Try a skirt.' '' Although her choice was based on comfort, her trademark trousered look became so influential that the Council of Fashion Designers of America gave her a lifetime achievement award in 1986.         Many of her early films are now regarded as classics. Playing a tough, determined actress in ''Stage Door'' (1937), she read a line from a play -- ''The calla lilies are in bloom again'' -- that became the all-time favorite of Hepburn impersonators. Life magazine said that ''Stage Door'' proved that she was ''potentially, the screen's greatest actress.''         She played a free-spirited heiress in ''Bringing Up Baby'' (1938), opposite Cary Grant and a leopard. But the film, now treasured, was a box-office flop, and by then her career was in decline. In 1938 she appeared on a list of actors labeled ''box-office poison'' in a poll of movie exhibitors.         Rather than appear in a film called ''Mother Carey's Chickens,'' she bought out her contract with R.K.O. She made ''Holiday,'' another classic romantic comedy with Grant, in which she was another high-spirited socialite.         Then Miss Hepburn took charge of her career in a way few women dared in those days of the studio system. Philip Barry wrote the play ''The Philadelphia Story'' for her, modeling his heroine, Tracy Lord, on Miss Hepburn. Tracy Lord is a beautiful, high-spirited rich woman, about to marry her second husband, when her first husband and a reporter who is covering the wedding arrive to create an unexpected romantic tangle.         The play was a hit, and Miss Hepburn owned the rights to it because Howard Hughes, a sometime beau, had bought them for her. She went to Louis B. Mayer, the head of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio, and sold him the property on the condition that she play the lead. She chose her friend George Cukor to direct. And she asked for Spencer Tracy and Clark Gable as her co-stars. She got Cary Grant as her former husband, James Stewart as the reporter, and a hit movie. She never lost control of her career again.         Soon she went back to Mayer with another script, ''Woman of the Year,'' the story of the unlikely romance between a hotshot political columnist and a sportswriter. She asked for Tracy, whom she had never met, to play the sportswriter. This time she got him.         A Loving Partnership         The success of ''Woman of the Year'' (1942) and the stars' off-screen relationship led to other Tracy and Hepburn films that followed a similar pattern. In ''Adam's Rib'' (1949), they are married, opposing lawyers, both nicknamed Pinky. In ''Pat and Mike'' (1952), she is a champion athlete, and he is her rough-hewn manager, with whom she falls in love.         The film was devised to show off Miss Hepburn's well-cultivated athletic ability. Almost to the end of her life she played tennis and swam, and in earlier years she golfed.         It was in ''Pat and Mike'' that Tracy spoke the often-quoted line about Miss Hepburn's figure, ''Not much meat on her, but what's there is 'cherce.' ''         Miss Hepburn often said Tracy was the best actor she had ever known and compared him in complimentary terms to a baked potato: solid, substantial stuff. ''He's meat and potatoes, meat and potatoes,'' she would say. ''I'm more like a fancy French dessert, I'm a little bit fancy, aren't I? But I wish I were meat and potatoes.'' Her other films with Tracy included the political dramas ''Keeper of the Flame'' (1942) and ''State of the Union'' (1948).         One of her most enduring films without Tracy was ''The African Queen'' (1952), in which she played the straitlaced Rosie opposite Humphrey Bogart for the director John Huston.         She wrote about it in her first book, published in 1987, whose title captures the direct, colloquial style of her writing: ''The Making of the African Queen: Or, How I Went to Africa With Bogart, Bacall and Huston and Almost Lost My Mind'' (Knopf).         Later she achieved one of her great artistic triumphs in an unlikely role, as the 12th-century Eleanor of Aquitaine in ''The Lion in Winter'' (1968). There was still something of the typical Hepburn persona in the steely manipulation and breaking heart of the aging, dismissed queen, but none of the actress's contemporary mannerisms.         Her versatility lasted well into her career. She played the distraught, drug-addicted Mary Tyrone in the 1962 film of Eugene O'Neill's ''Long Day's Journey Into Night.'' She was a fair match in toughness for John Wayne in the western ''Rooster Cogburn'' (1975). And in ''On Golden Pond'' (1981) she starred opposite Henry Fonda as a feisty older woman coping with her husband's failing memory and insisting that they should go on and live life to the fullest. In that role, the on-screen and off-screen Hepburn seemed to meld as easily as they had in her youth.         Her final screen appearance, in 1994, was a minor but tremendously emotional role in ''Love Affair.'' Playing Warren Beatty's wise old aunt, she gave advice to the woman he loved, played by Annette Bening. Miss Hepburn's age gave the role the trappings of a farewell to movies, but if she moved more slowly than before, in demeanor she was as game and modern as she had ever been, even venturing an unprintable line about ducks.         Throughout her career, she returned to the stage periodically. She appeared in ''The Millionairess,'' by George Bernard Shaw, on Broadway in 1952. In the late 1950's she also appeared in several Shakespeare plays in Stratford, Conn.         And in 1969, when she was 62, she made her singing debut on Broadway in the Alan Jay Lerner musical ''Coco,'' based on the life of the fashion designer Coco Chanel. She also appeared on Broadway in 1976 in ''A Matter of Gravity,'' by Enid Bagnold, and in 1981 in ''The West Side Waltz,'' by Ernest Thompson, who had written ''On Golden Pond.''         Her performances in all three of these plays were received with dazzling praise; the works themselves were treated more harshly. Walter Kerr of The New York Times wrote about her performance in ''The West Side Waltz'' in terms that reflected the general critical opinion: ''One mysterious thing she has learned to do is breathe unchallengeable life into lifeless lines.''         A Beloved Aunt on TV         In the 1970's she acted in television movies, including the Edwardian romantic drama ''Love Among the Ruins'' (1975), with Laurence Olivier, and ''The Corn Is Green'' (1979), both directed by Cukor. And in later years she kept busy with minor television movies.         She played a fictional version of the typically feisty Kate Hepburn character in ''Mrs. Delafield Wants to Marry'' (1986), ''Laura Lansing Slept Here'' (1988) and ''The Man Upstairs'' (1992).         In 1994 she appeared in a few scenes in the television movie ''One Christmas,'' as yet another wise old aunt. Her tailor-made Hepburn lines included these: ''I've always lived my life exactly as I wanted. I wouldn't change a single thing. No regrets.''         As she aged, she had some physical problems from which she recovered well. She had hip-replacement surgery and operations on both her shoulders, but she remained spry. Although her head shook visibly in television interviews from the 1980's on, she vehemently denied the rumor that she had Parkinson's disease, saying she had inherited her shaking head from her grandfather Hepburn.         Her most striking television appearance was not in a dramatic role, but in a 1986 tribute to Spencer Tracy. Speaking openly about their relationship at last, she read a letter she had written to him, which she later included in her autobiography. She recalled their last years together, when he was ill and had trouble sleeping, and she would sit on the floor by his side and talk. She wondered why he drank.         ''What was it, Spense?'' she asked. It was an eloquent and sentimental performance that distilled the way her public and private lives blended.         At the conclusion of ''All About Me,'' her own television biography, she said: ''In some ways I've lived my life as a man, made my own decisions. I've been as terrified as the next person, but you've got to keep a-going; you've got to dream.'' In typical Katharine Hepburn style, she faced the camera and, at the age of 85, tacitly acknowledged how close she had to be to the end.         ''I have no fear of death,'' she said. ''Must be wonderful, like a long sleep. But let's face it: it's how you live that really counts.''         With her angular beauty and unmistakable voice, Katharine Hepburn was a distinctive presence in films and on stage, whether sparring with a modern-day suitor or trading quips in Shakespearean dress. Here are some of the plays and films in which she appeared.         Plays         The Warrior's Husband -- 1932  The Lake -- 1933  Jane Eyre -- 1937  The Philadelphia Story -- 1939  Without Love -- 1942  As You Like It -- 1950  The Millionairess -- 1952  The Merchant of Venice -- 1957  Much Ado About Nothing -- 1957  Twelfth Night -- 1960  Antony and Cleopatra -- 1960  Coco -- 1969  A Matter of Gravity -- 1976  The West Side Waltz -- 1981         Films         A Bill of Divorcement -- 1932  Christopher Strong -- 1933  Morning Glory -- 1933  Little Women -- 1933  The Little Minister -- 1934  Alice Adams -- 1935  Sylvia Scarlett -- 1936  Quality Street -- 1937  Stage Door -- 1937  Bringing Up Baby -- 1938  Holiday -- 1938  The Philadelphia Story -- 1940  Woman of the Year -- 1942  Dragon Seed -- 1944  The Sea of Grass -- 1947  State of the Union -- 1948  Adam's Rib -- 1949  The African Queen -- 1951  Pat and Mike -- 1952  Summertime -- 1955  The Rainmaker -- 1956  Desk Set -- 1957  Long Day's Journey Into Night -- 1962  Guess Who's Coming to Dinner -- 1967  The Lion in Winter -- 1968  Rooster Cogburn -- 1975  Love Among the Ruins (television) -- 1975  The Corn Is Green (television) -- 1979  On Golden Pond -- 1981  Love Affair -- 1994       
         Gladys Heldman, an instrumental figure in the formation of women's professional tennis, died Sunday at her home in Sante Fe, N.M. She was 81.         The Sante Fe Police Department reported that Ms. Heldman died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The police report said she had been experiencing health difficulties.         Ms. Heldman, the founder, publisher and editor of World Tennis magazine, began playing tennis at age 25. As an amateur, she was ranked No. 1 in Texas. She competed in the United States National Championships four times and at Wimbledon in 1954.         Off the court, Ms. Heldman was an indomitable force. She started World Tennis magazine in 1953 as a forum for the sport's views and problems. During its early years, the magazine was a one-woman operation, with Ms. Heldman as editor in chief, layout editor, art director and advertising director. She sold the magazine to CBS Publications in 1972.         The magazine helped transform Ms. Heldman into an advocate for women's tennis and one of the most influential people in the game.         In 1970, she used her status to help nine of the top women's players, led by Billie Jean King and Rosie Casals, form their own pro tour.         She arranged for the Houston Racquet Club to sponsor a tournament and had nearly all the players in the group sign $1 contracts with World Tennis to play in the tournament. Heldman persuaded her friend Joseph Cullman, chairman of Philip Morris, to donate prize money and sponsor five tournaments.         Despite suspensions and economic sanctions, the women's pro tour evolved into the Virginia Slims tour.         ''Without Gladys, there wouldn't be women's professional tennis,'' King said in a statement Monday. ''When I accepted that $1 contract from Gladys more than 30 years ago, I knew we were all part of something special and that women's tennis had been changed forever because of her vision.''         Gladys Medalie Heldman was born May 13, 1922, in New York City. Her father, George Z. Medalie, was a New York lawyer and judge. A Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Stanford University, she married Julius Heldman, a former United States junior tennis champion, in 1942.         The Heldmans' daughters, Carrie and Julie, were accomplished players; Julie was ranked as high as No. 5 in the world in 1969 and 1974.         Ms. Heldman was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1979. She is survived by her husband, her daughters and three grandchildren.       
         Diane Geppi-Aikens, who coached the Loyola of Maryland women's lacrosse team to a No. 1 ranking and the semifinals of the N.C.A.A. Division I tournament this season while in a motorized wheelchair with brain cancer, died Sunday at her home in Baltimore. She was 40.         For the past eight years, Geppi-Aikens had been battling a brain tumor. But she continued with her coaching duties, keeping Loyola College among the elite in women's lacrosse.         This year, she coached all except one of Loyola's games, even though her left side was partially paralyzed, and she had been in a wheelchair since February. Her squad won its first 14 games and finished 17-2, reaching the semifinals for the seventh time in her 15 years as head coach and the third time in the past four seasons. Opposing players honored her by wearing green shoelaces or headbands, for Loyola's colors of green and gray.         In January, Geppi-Aikens was among three recipients of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's annual Inspiration Award. The Intercollegiate Women's Lacrosse Coaches Association renamed its lifetime achievement award in her honor. Today, College Sports Television will present the premiere of ''Season of Hope: The Diane Geppi-Aikens Story,'' a chronicle of her final year as coach.         ''I still am lucky every day,'' Geppi-Aikens told NBC News in May. ''I don't know how many people can say that.         ''I'm not going to say it hasn't been difficult. I feel like I could have been out of here quite a while ago, based on the prognosis, but I chose to fight it.''         A native of Baltimore, Geppi-Aikens was an all-American lacrosse goalie and also played volleyball at Loyola, graduating in 1984. She was the national women's lacrosse coach of the year in 1996, 1997 and this season, had a career record of 197-71 and led Loyola to the N.C.A.A. tournament 10 times. She also served as Loyola's volleyball coach from 1984 to 1990 and as an assistant athletic director from 1993 to 1998.         She had surgery to remove a brain tumor, first found to be benign, six games into the 1995 season. In 1997 and 1998, her symptoms recurred, resulting in surgery again. In 2001, she had surgery for the third time.         Last December, she called her players together and told them she now had brain cancer and that her tumor was inoperable.         ''We were all sobbing,'' Jen Albright, a senior midfielder, recalled in an interview with The Philadelphia Inquirer in May. ''She comes right back and tells us a funny story to pick our spirits up.''         Geppi-Aikens persevered in the hopes of seeing her son, Michael, graduate from high school and having her team make it to the N.C.A.A. semifinals again. On May 31, two weeks after her team went to the tournament semifinals, she attended Michael's graduation in Towson, Md.         In addition to Michael, 18, she is survived by three daughters, Jessica, 16, Melissa, 12, and Shannon, 9; her sisters, Patricia Gorsuch, of Baltimore, and Carolyn Geppi, of Greenland, N.H.; her parents, John and Katherine Geppi, and her grandmother Marie Meyers, all of Baltimore. Her marriage to Robert Aikens ended in divorce.         Geppi-Aikens's 2003 squad lost to Princeton, the eventual national champions, 5-3, in the N.C.A.A. tournament semifinals.         ''Having Diane in our lives, she taught us that winning and losing a lacrosse game isn't anything,'' Suzanne Eyler, a senior and the team's top scorer, told The Baltimore Sun afterward. ''Being with the people that you love and enjoying life, that's really how you win at life.''       
         Celia Cruz, the Cuban singer who became the queen of Latin music, died yesterday at her home in Fort Lee, N.J. She was 77.         The cause was complications after surgery for a brain tumor, said a spokeswoman, Blanca Lasalle.         Onstage, Ms. Cruz was a petite woman who wore tight, glittering dresses and towering wigs, dancing in high heels and belting songs that she punctuated with shouts of ''Azucar!'' (''Sugar!''). She was a vocal powerhouse, with a tough, raspy voice that could ride the percussive attack of a rumba or bring hard-won emotion to a lovelorn Cuban son.         ''When people hear me sing,'' she said in an interview with The New York Times, ''I want them to be happy, happy, happy. I don't want them thinking about when there's not any money, or when there's fighting at home. My message is always felicidad -- happiness.''         In a career that began in the 1940's, Ms. Cruz sang with every major Latin bandleader and recorded more than 70 albums. She sang a full spectrum of Afro-Cuban music, from the religious chants of santería to mambos and cha-chas to modern salsa. Yet unlike many of the Latin musicians in her wake, she didn't court a crossover audience. She recorded in Spanish, modestly saying that her English was not good enough.         Ms. Cruz was born in Havana to a poor family, and she regularly sang her brothers and sisters to sleep. She won a radio talent contest after a cousin took her to the radio station García Serra; first prize was a cake. She went on to study at the Havana Conservatory and to sing on radio programs. In 1950, she joined La Sonora Matancera, Cuba's most popular band. ''I wanted to be a mother, a teacher and a housewife,'' she told The New York Times. ''But when I began to sing with La Sonora Matancera, I thought, 'This is my chance, and I'm going to do it.' ''         She toured with the group constantly, sometimes singing five sets a day; they were also headliners at Havana's most celebrated nightclub, the Tropicana, and performed on radio and television. But in 1960, a year after Fidel Castro took power in Cuba, she was touring Mexico with La Sonora Matancera and decided not to return to Cuba. Years later, Cuba refused permission for her to attend her father's funeral.         Ms. Cruz moved to New York in 1961, and later to Fort Lee. In 1962, she married Pedro Knight, a trumpeter from La Sonora Matancera who became her musical director and manager. He survives her, along with two sisters, Gladys Becquer and Dolores Cruz.         In New York, she held on to her Cuban roots while adding some of the city's Puerto Rican and later Dominican elements to her music. She sang with Tito Puente's orchestra in the 1960's, a collaboration she periodically renewed through the next decades, and in the 1970's she also sang with bandleaders like Johnny Pacheco, Willie Colón and Ray Barretto. She performed with the Fania All-Stars at Yankee Stadium in 1975.         ''Women are afraid to sing salsa,'' she once said. ''I don't know why. Maybe they think it's for men.'' She added, ''But I think everybody can sing everything.''         She continued to modernize her music, working with Miami-based producers like Willy Chirino and Emilio Estefan and with Sergio George in New York, who produced her most recent albums. She also collaborated with many of the musicians who admired her, among them Luciano Pavarotti, Gloria Estefan, David Byrne of Talking Heads and the Brazilian songwriter Caetano Veloso.         In 1989, Ms. Cruz won a Grammy award for best tropical Latin performance for an album in collaboration with Mr. Barretto, ''Ritmo en el Corazón.'' In 1989, Yale University awarded Ms. Cruz an honorary doctorate (alongside Stephen Hawking), and in 1990 the main street of Little Havana in Miami, Calle Ocho, added the name Celia Cruz Way. In 1994, President Clinton gave her the National Medal of Arts. She won the first Latin Grammy Award for best tropical album in 2000. Until last year, Ms. Cruz continued to perform and record constantly on an international circuit that included jazz festivals and arena concerts along with Latin clubs.         She had surgery for a brain tumor in December 2002, but in February she returned to the studio to record an album, ''Regalo de Alma,'' that is due for release Aug. 5 on Sony Discos. That same month, her 2002 album, ''La Negra Tiene Tumbao,'' won the Grammy Award for best salsa album. In March, the Telemundo network broadcast a live concert tribute to Ms. Cruz, in which she performed alongside other Latin stars, including Marc Anthony, to raise money for the Celia Cruz Foundation for Hispanic students to study music. It will give its first five grants on her birthday this year, Oct. 21.       
         Barbara B. Lazarus, an educational anthropologist who studied barriers to women entering science and engineering and created programs to overcome them, died last Tuesday in Pittsburgh. She was 57.         The cause was cancer, her husband, Marvin Sirbu, said.         Dr. Lazarus, who was associate provost for academic affairs at Carnegie Mellon University, was recognized for her creative methods of increasing the number of women in science and engineering at Carnegie Mellon and elsewhere. Her programs became models for other colleges, which often sought her help.         She also helped women's colleges in Asia find ways to help their graduates enter the work force. She combined her professional knowledge of the workplace with her personal experience with cancer -- she was first diagnosed in her early 30's -- to write about the problems cancer survivors face in their careers.         Dr. Lazarus started her work in Providence, R.I., in the early 1970's, developing materials to help telephone counselors advise women who wanted to enter or re-enter the work force. Later, as director of the Center for Women's Careers at Wellesley College, she adopted similar techniques to offer phone counseling to alumni who wanted help with their careers.         She also dreamed up a program now known as ''Explanatoids'' -- signs and videos at playgrounds, amusement parks and other sites to explain the science of everything from roller coasters to the curve balls being thrown at PNC Park, where the Pirates play.         The program will be extended to the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum in Washington this fall.         Dr. Lazarus is survived by her husband; two children, Margaret Ann Lazarus Sirbu and Benjamin James Lazarus Sirbu; her parents, David and Betty Lazarus of Urbana, Ill., and Chilmark, Mass.; two brothers, William of Washington and Richard of Cabin John, Md.; and a sister, Mary Ann Lazarus of St. Louis.       
         Carol Matthau, whose outspoken memoir of her life and three marriages to two famous men brought her notoriety far beyond her own wide circle of Hollywood and literary celebrities, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 78.         The cause was a brain aneurysm, said her son Charles Matthau, a film director.         Mrs. Matthau was the widow of the actor Walter Matthau, to whom she was married from 1959 until his death three years ago at 79. She was previously wed twice to the author and playwright William Saroyan.         With the publication of ''Among the Porcupines: A Memoir'' (Random/Turtle Bay) in 1992, the mercurial wit that was both loved and feared by friends like Maureen Stapleton, Oona O'Neill, Gloria Vanderbilt and Truman Capote became public property.         For example, when a Swedish starlet flirted with Mr. Matthau and he asked her age, Mrs. Matthau said she interjected, ''For God's sake, Walter, why don't you chop off her legs and read the rings?''         In an interview with The New York Times shortly after the book's publication, she said: ''I married Saroyan the second time because I couldn't believe how terrible it was the first time. I married Walter because I love to sleep with him.''         She was a friend of Capote for decades and laid claim in her memoir to having been his muse for Holly Golightly, the blithe spirit of his ''Breakfast at Tiffany's.'' She also figured in the ''Côte Basque'' section of his ''Answered Prayers'' and defended Capote long after other unwitting celebrity subjects turned against him.         Rejecting the Holly Golightly part later in life, however, she said there were only two roles she coveted: Mary Tyrone in Eugene O'Neill's ''Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' and Amanda Wingfield, or, as she put it: ''The lady who sells magazine subscriptions on the telephone. You know, 'The Glass Menagerie.' ''         Ms. Matthau had begun an acting career before her marriages and also published a novella about her own childhood under the pen name Carol Grace, ''The Secret in the Daisy,'' in 1955.         Carol Grace Marcus Matthau was born in Manhattan and never knew her father; she grew up in foster homes until she was 8, when her mother married Charles Marcus, an executive with the Bendix Aircraft Corporation, who adopted her.         Moving to Fifth Avenue, she went to the Dalton School, became friends with Oona O'Neill, the daughter of the Eugene O'Neill who later married Charlie Chaplin, and started meeting other people in the theater.         As told in ''Among the Porcupines,'' Saroyan, the Pulitzer Prize laureate, dated her when she was still in her teens, and they were married in 1943.         They had a son, Aram, and a daughter, Lucy, who died earlier this year. The union with Saroyan, who was well known for his difficulty, was far from happy. After the second divorce, they parted company for good. By then she had met Walter Matthau and studied Method acting with Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse.         She understudied Jayne Mansfield in ''Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?'' and married Matthau in August 1959. After that, she listed herself as a homemaker and freelance writer.         Mrs. Matthau is survived by her two sons, Charles, known professionally also as Charlie Matthau, of Manhattan, and Aram Saroyan of Los Angeles; a sister, Elinor Pruder of Brooklyn; and three grandchildren.         Correction:  July 26, 2003, Saturday  An obituary on Thursday about Carol Matthau, who wrote of her life among Hollywood and literary celebrities, misstated the residence of her surviving sister, Elinor Dee Pruder. It is Southampton, N.Y., not Brooklyn.       
         Dorothy Miller, one of the first curators hired by the Museum of Modern Art, in 1934, and the woman responsible for pioneering exhibitions of new American artists that helped propel generations of painters like Pollock, Rothko, Frank Stella and Jasper Johns onto the international scene, died yesterday at her apartment in Greenwich Village. She was 99.         Ms. Miller was a clairvoyant curator with unusually wide-ranging tastes. Her career began when American modernists like Stuart Davis were still young and lasted into the early heyday of Mr. Stella, Ellsworth Kelly, James Rosenquist and Claes Oldenburg. She included Mr. Oldenburg and Mr. Rosenquist in the last of her ''Americans'' exhibitions, in 1963.         The ''Americans'' shows began in 1942 with a selection of what were then mostly unknown artists of eclectic styles from across the country. The format was to have a select group of artists, abstract and figurative, each presented in some depth. The slender catalogs had statements by the artists. Typically, Ms. Miller wanted them to speak for themselves rather than presuming to speak for them.         She was invariably a step ahead of public taste. The 1942 show was panned. The museum's trustees were appalled. Some threatened to quit. Even Alfred H. Barr Jr., the Modern's visionary director, who otherwise supported Ms. Miller, quietly tried to distance himself from it.         Ms. Miller would organize her ''Americans'' shows at the last minute, to remain perfectly up to date and to keep secret the names of the artists until just before the opening. ''Congratulations, Dorothy,'' Barr told her after one opening. ''You've done it again. They all hate it.''         But over time, many of the artists she discovered came to be admired. ''I was fortunate to have two brilliant guides,'' she said, modestly, ''Alfred H. Barr Jr. and my husband, Holger Cahill.''         Dorothy Canning Miller was born on Feb. 6, 1904, in Hopedale, Mass., and was reared in Montclair, N.J. After graduating from Smith College in 1925, she enrolled in the Newark Museum apprentice program and was hired at the museum in 1926. There she met Mr. Cahill, a curator, with whom she worked on exhibitions of progressive American art that caught Mr. Barr's attention. He hired her. When Mr. Cahill was appointed director of the W.P.A. Federal Art Project in Washington in 1935, he asked Ms. Miller to join him. She declined, saying she had landed the ''best job in the museum world'' at the Modern.         Her first show there was about W.P.A. art. After she organized ''Americans 1942,'' she put together ''American Realists and Magic Realists'' in 1943, ''Fourteen Americans'' in 1946, ''Fifteen Americans'' in 1952, ''Twelve Americans'' in 1956, ''Sixteen Americans'' in 1959 and her last ''Americans'' show in 1963. The 1946 show included Gorky, Isamu Noguchi and Robert Motherwell; the 1952 show had Pollock, Rothko and Clyfford Still; the 1956 show introduced Larry Rivers and Grace Hartigan to a wide public; the 1959 show had Mr. Stella, Louise Nevelson, Jay de Feo, Robert Rauschenberg and Mr. Johns. The 1963 show, besides Mr. Oldenburg and Mr. Kelly, featured Cryssa, Lee Bontecou, Richard Lindner and Robert Indiana. Reviewing it in The New York Times, John Canaday said it answered ''the 30-year-old question of what ever happened to vaudeville. It moved to the Museum of Modern Art.''         The most influential exhibition that Ms. Miller organized was surely ''The New American Painting,'' which toured Europe in 1958 and 1959.         It significantly changed European perceptions of American art, putting Abstract Expressionism on the map there once and for all.         In 1969 Ms. Miller retired from the Modern and became an adviser to various corporate collections and, with Eleanor Price Mather, was co-author of ''Edward Hicks: His Peaceable Kingdom and Other Paintings,'' about the early 19th-century American folk artist. She is survived by a stepdaughter, Jane Cahill Blumenfeld of Albuquerque, N.M.; a niece, Edith White Danton of Osterville, Mass.; and a nephew, Reid White of Lenox, Mass.         Russell Lynes, in his history of the Modern, said Ms. Miller was ''looked upon by artists either as a benign goddess or as a disdainful one, depending on whether or not she smiled on their work.''         Mr. Stella said yesterday: ''She was a straight shooter, very respectful of the art and the artists and the museum, something you don't get that much of anymore. The 'Americans' shows set the tone for my time. You were either in or you were not. They were exhibitions of what was going on, pointing to the future, and they were definitive. Or if they weren't definitive, they were certainly exciting.''       
         Dr. Josefina B. Magno, an oncologist who established some of the first hospice programs in the United States and helped bring the hospice concept into the medical mainstream, died on July 27 in Manila. She was 83.         Born in the Philippines, Dr. Magno moved to the Washington area in 1969 to join the staff of the Georgetown University Hospital. Three years later, breast cancer was detected, and she underwent a radical mastectomy and intensive chemotherapy.         The experience made her more aware of the physical and emotional pain suffered by the terminal patients around her. It also made her realize that the medical profession, which focused on curing illness and prolonging life, had relatively little to offer the dying.         After recovering, Dr. Magno went to England, where the world's first research and teaching hospice was established in 1967. She studied the hospice approach there, which combined pain management with psychological and spiritual counseling.         In 1976, she created a pilot hospice program at Georgetown, persuading Blue Cross-Blue Shield to cover expenses for its subscribers by pointing out that fees would be half what hospitals charged. The next year, she established the Hospice of Northern Virginia.         Dr. Magno became the first executive director of the National Hospice Organization in 1980. In three years in office, she persuaded Congress to pass legislation to include hospice care under Medicare.         In 1984, she established the International Hospice Institute to train doctors in the United States and developing countries. Moving to Michigan, she founded the first hospice there and created the hospice service at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit. In 1998, she returned to the Philippines, where she helped establish programs for the poor.         Josefina Bautista Magno was born on Dec. 28, 1919, in San Fernando, Pampanga, on Luzon. She received a medical degree from the University of Santo Tomas.         She is survived by six children: Jose, Manny and Cesar, of Detroit; Vincent, of Richmond; and Nanette Magno-Velayo and Carlo, of Manila; three sisters; a brother; 15 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Her husband, Dr. Cesar P. Magno, died in 1955.       
         Laura Rapaport Borsten, who was in the first group of 40 recruits accepted to be a Wave, a member of the women's Navy corps, died on Aug. 11 at a hospital in Los Angeles. She was 91.         Her husband, Orin, said Mrs. Borsten, who lived in Los Angeles, kept up with other veterans and believed she was the last surviving member of the first group, made up of officer trainees.         Lt. Billy Ray Davis, a Navy spokesman, confirmed that Mrs. Borsten, then Laura Rapaport, joined as one of the first 40 Waves on Aug. 28, 1942. She rose to the rank of lieutenant commander.         President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the law creating the Women's Reserve of the Navy on July 30, 1942. The corps was soon christened Waves, for Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service. Capt. Mildred McAfee, first director of the corps, suggested that it really meant ''Women Are Very Essential Sometimes.''         Organized to allow more men to be available for combat, women soon filled jobs like repairing aircraft, breaking enemy codes and serving as gunnery instructors. Many did clerical work.         Before the Waves, neither the women who served in World War I nor Navy nurses were permitted to become officers. Mrs. Borsten and her fellow officer trainees were greeted by newsreel cameras and autograph hunters when they reported for training at Smith College in Northampton, Mass.         By the end of the war, there were 8,000 Wave officers and 76,000 enlisted Waves. Though the name Wave was dropped in 1972, Navy women have gone on to command battleships and fighter squadrons, and rise to the rank of three-star admiral.         But they presented challenges to military tradition. For example, Miss McAfee decreed that Waves would be allowed to wear enough makeup ''to look human.''         Laura Golde Rapaport was born on a farm in McIntosh County, N.D., on Feb. 29, 1912.         She graduated from the University of Minnesota with honors in library science. Just as she was starting a job in adult education, Leo W. Schwarz, an author and lecturer on Jewish concerns, met her in Minneapolis. He asked her if she wanted a job in New York City.         She became director of international relations and social relations for the National Council of Jewish Women, and, among other things, helped bring Jews out of Hitler's Germany. In 1938, she testified a Senate committee against the equal-rights amendment, saying that it might jeopardize the gains women had made in areas like widows' pensions.         In 1942, she received a call from Elizabeth Reynard, a Barnard professor who was to become assistant director of the Waves. Professor Reynard said that Miss McAfee, who was to become Waves director, wondered if she was interested in joining.         Like most of the original 40 officer candidates, all of whom had distinguished themselves professionally, Miss Rapaport had no idea why she was asked.         After training at Smith, Miss Rapaport was selected to teach the 750 women arriving for officers' training. She was then assigned to teach officers and enlisted Waves at U.S.S. Hunter, the name the Navy had given Hunter College in the Bronx. She succeeded in her quiet campaign to recruit black officers, and helped forestall a proposal for segregated platoons.         Her last assignment was in Hawaii, the first posting of Waves outside the continental United States. As a transportation officer there, she learned to drive.         After her discharge, she visited her sister in Los Angeles. On a street corner, she saw Mr. Borsten, whom she had dated before the war. They were married a few months later.         In addition to him, Mrs. Borsten is survived by a son, Joseph Borsten of Los Angeles; a daughter, Joan Borsten Vidov of Los Angeles; a sister, Lillian Minkowski of Santa Cruz; and a grandson.       
         Nadia Younes, an Egyptian who was chief of staff for the senior United Nations representative in Iraq, Sergio Vieira de Mello, died in the bomb attack in Baghdad on Monday, the United Nations said on Wednesday. She was 57.         Mr. Vieira de Mello also died in the attack.         Earlier, Ms. Younes served as chief of protocol at the biggest gathering of world leaders the United Nations has every held, the meeting of 150 kings, presidents, prime ministers and dictators at its headquarters in New York in September 2000.         Ms. Younes was made chief protocol officer by Secretary General Kofi Annan in January 1998 and held the post until 2002. She had a major role in organizing the millennium summit meeting, as well as the responsibility for keeping feathers unruffled during the three-day gathering.         That the meeting, mainly devoted to brainstorming about the coming century, went off smoothly was in large measure attributed to Ms. Younes's dextrous handling of the assembled potentates.         Ms. Younes faced some tricky moments. The wife of a Saudi delegate, thrilled by a ride on a double-decker New York sightseeing bus, asked her how to buy one and take it home. And a mysterious figure identified as Count Carlo Marullo di Condojanni of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta somehow got himself into the official photo of world leaders.         From 1999 until 2001, Ms. Younes took time off from her protocol duties to serve as spokeswoman for Bernard Kouchner, the French politician and founder of Doctors Without Borders, while he was United Nations administrator in Kosovo.         From 1988 until 1993, she was deputy to the spokesman for the secretary general, serving Javier Pérez de Cuéllar and Boutros Boutros-Ghali.         Nadia Younes was born in Cairo on June 13, 1946, and earned a bachelor's degree in English literature at Cairo University in 1966.         She joined the United Nations in 1970, at the same time beginning studies at New York University, where she earned a master's degree in political science and international relations in 1973. She transferred to the department of public information in 1974 and held a large number of press and information positions. In 1993 she went to Rome to head the United Nations information office there.         In 2002 she transferred to the World Health Organization in Geneva, where she took charge of external relations for Gro Harlem Brundtland, then the director general. Earlier this year she moved to Baghdad.         She is survived by a brother, Fouad Younes, of Cairo, and a sister, Nahed Fouad, of London.       
         Althea Gibson emerged in the tennis world of the 1950's as a most unlikely queen of the lawns of Wimbledon and Forest Hills.         In 1950 she became the first black to compete in the United States nationals. She won 56 tournaments, including five Grand Slam singles titles -- the United States nationals and Wimbledon twice, in 1957 and 1958, and the French championship in 1956.         What made that especially remarkable was her background as a rough-hewn product of Harlem, a chronic truant and an eighth-grade dropout.         She had grown up far removed from the two genteel worlds of tennis: the white country club set and the network of black doctors, lawyers and other professionals who pursued tennis on private courts of their own.         Gibson owed much of her success to that very network of black tennis enthusiasts and to a geographic coincidence.         Althea Gibson, born in a sharecropper's shack in Silver, S.C., on Aug. 25, 1927, was brought to New York by her parents when she was a few months old. By chance, the family moved into an apartment on a West 143rd Street block between Lenox and Seventh Avenues that was a designated play street.         When the volunteers from the Police Athletic League closed the block to traffic and set up their recreation equipment, the spot they chose to mark off as a paddle tennis court was right in front of the Gibsons' front stoop.         A natural athlete who excelled in virtually every sport she tried, Gibson took up paddle tennis at 9 and won a citywide championship when she was 12.         In 1941 Buddy Walker, a Harlem bandleader and part-time P.A.L. supervisor, bought her two rackets and introduced her to friends at the Cosmopolitan Tennis Club, a predominantly black club that played on courts on 149th Street just a few blocks away but a world removed from the neighborhood she had known. Gibson was coached there by Fred Johnson, the one-armed club pro, and taken up by the club's members, who taught her some more important lessons.         As she put it in her 1958 autobiography, ''I Always Wanted to Be Somebody,'' the club attracted ''the highest class'' of Harlem residents, people, she noted, who ''had rigid ideas about what was socially acceptable.''         Those ideas were alien to her own experience.         ''I'm ashamed to say,'' she wrote, ''that I was still living pretty wild.''         Gibson would come home late (sometimes the next day) and her father, a garage attendant, would beat her. But Gibson saw her father as merely a stern disciplinarian, not abusive.         Gibson made a lifelong friendship when she approached her idol, the boxing champion Sugar Ray Robinson, in a bowling alley. Sympathetic to her dream of a career in music, he bought her a saxophone.         Finally, to escape her father's wrath, she sought refuge in a Catholic home for girls and eventually received a welfare grant to get her own apartment while she worked at menial jobs.         But it was tennis that gripped her interest. In 1942 she won her first tournament, the New York State girls' championship, sponsored by the American Tennis Association, which had been organized in 1916 by black players as an alternative to the United States Lawn Tennis Association.         In 1946, when she lost in the final of her first A.T.A. women's championship, she caught the eye of two men who changed her life and altered the course of tennis, Hubert A. Eaton of Wilmington, N.C., and R. Walter Johnson of Lynchburg, Va.         These men, both physicians and leaders of a cadre of black enthusiasts determined to crack the racial barriers of mainstream tennis, saw Gibson's potential and became her sponsors.         They arranged for Gibson to live with Eaton and his wife during the school year, practicing on his court and attending high school, and to spend the summer traveling on the A.T.A. circuit with Johnson, who later performed a similar service for Arthur Ashe.         She was 19 when she started at Wilmington Industrial High School, but finished in three years, graduating 10th in her class, and enrolled as a scholarship student at Florida A&M, receiving a degree at 25.         She also flourished on the court, winning the first of her 10 straight A.T.A. national championships in 1947.         In 1949, a year after Dr. Benjamin Weir had become the first black to play in a United States Lawn Tennis Association title event -- the 1948 National Indoor Championships -- Gibson took her first steps beyond the world of the black tennis circuit, making it to the semifinals of the Eastern Indoor Championships and then to the semifinals of the national championships.         The next step proved harder. Even after she had won the 1950 Eastern Indoor Championship and a clamor had begun to let her play in the National Grass Court Championships at Forest Hills, the precursor of the United States Open, the powers of tennis seemed to close ranks to keep her out.         To qualify for an invitation to the 1950 nationals, she was required to first make a name for herself at one of the major preliminary grass-court events. But no invitations were forthcoming.         Alice Marble, a former champion, rallied support for Gibson. ''If tennis is a game for ladies and gentlemen,'' she wrote in a letter to American Lawn Tennis magazine, ''it's time we acted a little more like gentlepeople and less like sanctimonious hypocrites.''         Finally, Gibson received an invitation to the Eastern Grass Court Championships at the Orange Lawn Tennis Club in South Orange, N.J. She made it only as far as the second round, but that was enough to win a bid to Forest Hills.         On Aug. 28, 1950, three years after Jackie Robinson had broken the color barrier in major league baseball, Gibson became the first black player to compete in the national tennis championship. Taking her place on a remote court at the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, Queens, she dispatched Barbara Knapp of England, 6-2, 6-2.         The next day, she faced the Wimbledon champion, Louise Brough. After losing the first set, 6-1, Gibson took the second, 6-3, then fell behind by 3-0 in the third before beginning a surge that brought repeated roars from 2,000 hardy spectators who ignored the first peals of thunder and flashes of lightning of a gathering storm.         Gibson took a lead of 7-6 and was on the verge of victory over her visibly spent opponent. But the rains came, the match was suspended, and when it resumed the next day, Brough won three straight games to win the match.         The 5-foot-10 1/2 Gibson gained the attention of the tennis public. A powerful if inconsistent player, the lean and muscular young woman had a dominating serve, and her long, graceful reach often stunned opponents.         Over the next half-dozen years, Gibson became a fixture on the tennis circuit, playing Wimbledon for the first time in 1951 and earning a ranking as high as No. 7 in the United States.         But Gibson became so disenchanted with her failure to break through to the top that she considered abandoning tennis and entering the Army.         In the fall of 1955, the State Department selected her for a goodwill tennis tour of Asia and the Far East, and the experience inspired her game. In 1956 she won 16 of her first 18 tournaments, including the French championship at Roland Garros, her first title at a Grand Slam event.         But once again victory in the singles championships eluded her at Wimbledon and Forest Hills, although she had been favored to win both. Gibson did team with Angela Buxton to win the Wimbledon doubles in 1956. She won in doubles again in 1957, with Darlene Hard, and in 1958, with Maria Bueno.         After losing to Shirley Fry of the United States in the singles final of the Australian Open in 1957, she did not lose another match all year. Passing up the clay court distraction of the French championship to concentrate on tuning up on grass courts in England, she again entered Wimbledon as the favorite and defeated Hard in the final.         ''At last,'' she said, ''at last,'' as she accepted the trophy from Queen Elizabeth II.         She later wrote in her autobiography: ''Shaking hands with the Queen of England was a long way from being forced to sit in the colored section of the bus going into downtown Wilmington, N.C.''         Upon returning home, Gibson was given a ticker-tape parade up Broadway, a banquet at the Waldorf-Astoria and a celebration on West 143rd Street.         She told friends and supporters, ''This victory belongs to you,'' but she chaffed at efforts to make her a symbol of black achievement.         When a reporter asked if she was proud to be compared to Jackie Robinson as an outstanding representative of her race, Gibson replied: ''No. I don't consider myself to be a representative of my people. I am thinking of me and nobody else.''         Having won Wimbledon, Gibson rolled through the national championship at Forest Hills. In the final, she defeated Brough, who had eliminated her in her first national seven years before.         After being named the outstanding female athlete of the year in a poll of Associated Press sports editors, Gibson repeated her Wimbledon and Forest Hills singles victories in 1958, and was named the outstanding female athlete again. Then, under pressure from her family to make some money from her talent, she announced her retirement from amateur tennis.         At a time when the professional game was little more than a sideshow, she had little trouble winning the pro title and went on an exhibition tour with the Harlem Globetrotters, playing tennis at halftime.         In the early 1960's she became the first black player to compete on the women's golf tour, but she never won a tournament. Gibson, who was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame at Newport, R.I., later held various athletic posts in New Jersey state government. A resident of East Orange, she had served as its recreation director.         Gibson was married twice, to William Darben and Sidney Llewellyn. She had no children.         When another black woman, Zina Garrison, made it to the Wimbledon final in 1990 before losing to Martina Navratilova, Gibson was there to cheer her on, but she soon receded from the limelight once again with health and financial problems.         ''It was truly an inspiration for me to watch her overcome adversity,'' Billie Jean King, who was 13 when she first say Gibson play, told The Associated Press yesterday. ''Her road to success was a challenging one, but I never saw her back down.''         Robert McG. Thomas Jr., a reporter for The New York Times, died in 2000.         Correction:  October 2, 2003, Thursday  An obituary on Monday about Althea Gibson, the first black competitor in the United State tennis nationals and the winner of five Grand Slam titles, gave an incorrect surname for the first black player in a United States Lawn Tennis Association title event. He was Dr. Reginald Weir, not Benjamin.       
         Susan Chilcott, a leading British soprano who had a winning Metropolitan Opera debut last year as Helena in Britten's ''Midsummer Night's Dream'' and received glowing reviews last June for her Royal Opera at Covent Garden debut as Lisa in Tchaikovsky's ''Queen of Spades,'' opposite Plácido Domingo, died on Thursday at her home in Timsbury, near Bath. She was 40.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         Ms. Chilcott, who began singing lessons at 6, attracted attention early in her career with her warm, dusky soprano and her stately and compelling stage presence. After appearing with the Scottish Opera, Opera North, the Welsh National Opera and the English National Opera, she made her first appearance outside Britain in 1994 at the Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie in Brussels, where she played Ellen Orford in a new production of Britten's ''Peter Grimes.''         There she became a protégée of the conductor Antonio Pappano, now the music director at Covent Garden, who said he was devastated by the news of her death. ''It is rare to come across an opera star who is as good an actress as she is a singer,'' Mr. Pappano said in The Times of London on Thursday.         Among the other roles she sang with the Brussels company were the Composer in Strauss's ''Ariadne auf Naxos,'' Hermione in the 1999 world premiere of Philippe Boesmans's ''Wintermärchen'' and Desdemona in Verdi's ''Otello,'' a part she also performed in a new production of that opera at the Glyndebourne Festival in July 2001. She made her United States debut in 1996 as Donna Elvira in Mozart's ''Don Giovanni'' at the Santa Fe Opera.         Ms. Chilcott's cancer was diagnosed in 2000. After surgery and chemotherapy, she had to withdraw the next year from a production of Prokofiev's ''War and Peace'' at the English National Opera. But as her condition improved, she continued to perform and accept important appearances, including the Met debut.         Last summer she made news during a performance in the ''Queen of Spades'' at Covent Garden when a candle set fire to the train of her dress. Absorbed in her singing, she did not hear the shouts from members of the audience and was startled when a member of the staff rushed onstage with a fire extinguisher.         Ms. Chilcott is survived by her husband, David Sigall, who was also her manager, and her 4-year-old son from an earlier relationship, Hugh.         She had been scheduled to sing Ellen Orford in the forthcoming season at Covent Garden and had also discussed future roles at the Met, though her illness prevented her from making any commitments.       
         Leni Riefenstahl, the German filmmaker whose daringly innovative documentaries about a Nazi rally in Nuremberg in 1934 and the Berlin Olympics of 1936 earned her both acclaim as a cinematic genius and contempt as a propagandist for Hitler, died on Monday night at her home in Pöcking, south of Munich. She was 101.         After the defeat of Germany in 1945, she was pronounced a Nazi sympathizer by the Allies and never again found work as a movie director. But her revolutionary film techniques deeply influenced later generations of documentary makers and television commercial makers, keeping alive the debate over whether her talent could be separated from her prewar political views.         For many students of her life and legacy, Ms. Riefenstahl was both propagandist and genius. A popular dancer and actress before becoming a movie director in 1932, she enthusiastically put her talent at the service of the Nazis. Yet, without her exceptional artistic vision, her two most famous documentaries, ''Triumph of the Will'' and the two-part ''Olympia,'' would neither have caused a sensation at the time nor be considered classics today.         Ms. Riefenstahl never denied her early conviction that Hitler could ''save'' Germany. She also said that her idealized image of him fell apart ''far too late,'' near the end of World War II. But amid widespread skepticism, she insisted that she was never a Nazi and that ''Triumph of the Will'' and ''Olympia'' were apolitical, inspired only by her desire to create works of art.         Still, while her documentaries continue to be studied in some film schools, Ms. Riefenstahl remained trapped in the shadow of her association with Hitler. Her repeated attempts to find financing for a new film always ended in failure, while public screenings of her movies and exhibitions of her photographs invariably prompted protests. As recently as last year she was briefly investigated in Germany on accusations of race-hatred crimes, but no charges were brought.         She nonetheless worked hard to shed her image as the Nazi regime's most persuasive propagandist. After the war she spent 20 years in relative isolation, living in her mother's apartment in Munich. Then, in the late 1960's, perhaps out of frustration, she reinvented herself as a photographer and, within a decade, she had made her name in a new visual art form.         A tiny woman of great physical courage and fierce determination, she next took up scuba diving, claiming to be only 51, when she was actually 20 years older, to obtain a diving license. Two collections of her underwater photographs, ''Coral Gardens'' and ''Wonders Under Water,'' were published in the United States, and she continued diving in the Maldives until she was in her late 90's. Last year, to coincide with her 100th birthday, she released her first movie in almost half a century, a 45-minute documentary of marine life called ''Impressions Under Water.''         But it was her photography that stirred most controversy. Inspired by George Rodger's famous image of a muscular Nuba wrestler carried on the shoulders of another fighter, she made several trips to southern Sudan to photograph the Nuba. She worked alone at first, then later with Horst Kettner, 42 years her junior, who became her companion and lived with her until her death. She has no other survivors. In March 2000, while making a return visit to the Nuba, the 97-year-old Ms. Riefenstahl was severely injured in a helicopter accident in Sudan. She was flown back to a hospital in Munich.         Her first Sudan book, ''Last of the Nuba,'' published in the United States in 1974, won her recognition as a photographer and to some extent rehabilitated her as an artist. But while even in Germany it became acceptable to praise Ms. Riefenstahl as the most important female movie director ever, both her role in celebrating the Third Reich and what the critic Susan Sontag described as the ''fascist aesthetics'' of her work also came under new scrutiny.         Writing in The New York Review of Books in 1975, Ms. Sontag said there was a common ''aesthetic'' running through what she called Ms. Riefenstahl's ''triptych of fascist visuals'' -- her early work as an actress in Arnold Fanck's ''mountain films,'' her two principal documentaries and her photographs of the Nuba. ''The fascist dramaturgy centers on the orgiastic transactions between mighty forces and their puppets,'' Ms. Sontag wrote. ''Its choreography alternates between ceaseless motion and a congealed, static, 'virile' posing.'' When Ms. Riefenstahl was over 90, she again found herself at the center of heated debate when she was the subject of a three-hour documentary, ''The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl'' (1993), by the German filmmaker Ray Müller. At about the same time, she also published her own 669-page autobiography, ''Leni Riefenstahl: A Memoir.''         In the book she was able to give her version of her life. Writing in The New York Times Book Review, John Simon said the memoir did not contain ''a single unspellbinding page.'' He raised the question about the veracity of her accounts of everything from her private meetings with Hitler to her life with the Nuba. But he concluded, ''The book must, in the main, be true; it is far too weird for fiction.''         In the documentary, while Mr. Müller allowed her to talk at fascinating length about her filmmaking techniques, he also questioned her memory, notably her claim to have had few dealings with Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's propaganda minister. At the end of the documentary, Mr. Müller also tried to provoke her into admitting guilt for her past.         ''What do you mean by that?'' she asked, clearly surprised. ''Where is my guilt? I can regret. I can regret that I made the party film, 'Triumph of the Will,' in 1934. But I cannot regret that I lived in that time. No anti-Semitic word has ever crossed my lips. I was never anti-Semitic. I did not join the party. So where then is my guilt? You tell me. I have thrown no atomic bombs. I have never betrayed anyone. What am I guilty of?''         It was evidently a well-rehearsed response. In an interview with The New York Times last year, she said: ''I didn't do any harm to anyone. What have I ever done? I never intended any harm to anyone.''         Certainly in her final years she never shied from the limelight. In 1997, when a Hamburg gallery held the first exhibition of her work in postwar Germany, Ms. Riefenstahl agreed to be interviewed by major German news weeklies even though she knew much of the questioning would be hostile. That same year, ignoring protests, she traveled to Los Angeles to receive a lifetime achievement award from Cinecon, a group that restores old movies. In 2001 she visited St. Petersburg, where her films were shown in a documentary festival.         Whether out of vanity or naïveté, Ms. Riefenstahl may well have believed that her artistic independence was never compromised, that she did not ''sell'' her talents to the Nazis who financed ''Triumph of the Will'' and ''Olympia.'' Yet, shaped by the profound romanticism of 19th-century German culture, her monumental vision of beauty fitted perfectly into the National Socialist ideology.         Born into a comfortable Berlin home on Aug. 22, 1902, Helene Berta Amalie Riefenstahl grew up loving nature and outdoor life. Her mother encouraged her artistic flair, and although her father, a businessman, was opposed to her working on the stage, she began dancing in an Isadora Duncan-like free style at age 16 and soon found work -- and considerable recognition -- in Berlin theaters.         In 1924 her life changed direction. Recovering from an injury at 22, Ms. Riefenstahl was profoundly affected by seeing Fanck's movie ''Mountain of Destiny'' and promptly sought out the director. Entranced by the striking young dancer, Fanck cast her in his next seven mountain films, among them ''The Holy Mountain,'' ''The White Hell of Piz Palu'' and ''SOS Iceberg.''         These films gave her the image of a romantic heroine in the Wagnerian cast, in harmony with nature and bent on fighting evil. Her often dangerous roles -- she climbed rock faces barefoot and was once almost swept away by an avalanche provoked by Fanck -- also showed her to be fearless. In 1932 she directed her first movie, ''The Blue Light,'' another mountain film, in which she appeared as a warm-hearted peasant girl. (The names of her Jewish co-writer, Bela Balazs, and the film's Jewish producer, Harry Sokal, were removed from the credits when ''The Blue Light'' was reissued in 1938.)         It was also around this time, one year before Hitler's rise to power, that she first heard the Nazi leader speak at a rally. ''I heard his voice: 'Fellow Germans,' '' she recalled in her autobiography. ''That very same instant I had an almost apocalyptic vision that I was never able to forget. It seemed as if the earth's surface were spreading out before me, like a hemisphere that suddenly splits apart in the middle, spewing out an enormous jet of water, so powerful that it touched the sky and shook the earth. I felt paralyzed.''         She subsequently wrote to Hitler, noting that ''I must confess that I was so impressed by you and by the enthusiasm of the spectators that I would like to meet you personally.'' Her popularity as an actress made the request seem reasonable; Hitler's appreciation of her role in ''The Blue Light'' made the encounter possible.         In the years that followed she met frequently with the Nazi leader. She always stridently denied that they were lovers, although recalling one meeting, she later wrote, ''That evening I felt that Hitler desired me as a woman.'' At their first meeting in 1932, though, she said she was most struck by his informality and she quoted him telling her, ''Once we come to power, you must make my films.''         In her autobiography she said she told him that she could not make films on commission. Yet, the following year, with Hitler now chancellor, she made ''Victory of the Faith,'' a documentary about a Nazi party rally at Nuremberg. She was not happy with the film, and the following year she tried again, this time with ample time, money and equipment. The result was ''Triumph of the Will.''         The film, which took almost two years to edit from 250 miles of raw footage, included such innovative techniques as moving cameras, including one on a tiny elevator attached to a flagpole behind the speaker's podium that provided sweeping panoramic views; the use of telephoto lenses to create a foreshortening effect (for example, when filming a parade of Nazi flags); frequent close-ups of wide-eyed party faithful; and heroic poses of Hitler shot from well below eye level. The film also used ''real sound'' but was accompanied by no commentary.         The film won Ms. Riefenstahl assorted German prizes, and although she again pledged to make no more party films, she then made an 18-minute documentary, ''Day of Freedom: Our Army,'' about the Wehrmacht in 1935. Soon afterward, she was commissioned by the German Olympic Committee to record the 1936 Berlin Olympics. To the end of her life, she insisted that ''Olympia'' was not an official film, but ample evidence exists to suggest that it was indirectly financed by Goebbels's propaganda ministry.         Still, she made extraordinary use of the 170-member team of cameramen and technicians that she assembled. To evoke the early Greek Olympics in the first part of the documentary, ''Festival of the Nations,'' she filmed near-naked athletes in assorted heroic poses. During the training period, she also filmed close-ups of oarsmen, marathon runners and swimmers that she edited into the final version. When the games began, she had to cover 136 events because, she recalled, ''we never knew when a world record would be broken.''         And once again, both her filming and editing techniques broke new ground. To capture the drama of the pole vault and long jump events, she had holes dug beside the sand pit where the athletes landed. In the high-diving event, which dominated the second part of the film, ''Festival of Beauty,'' she used four cameras, including one underwater, to capture the movement of divers from all angles. Then, in the editing room, she turned the divers into graceful birds.         ''Olympia'' was not blatantly propagandistic. Notably, it showed Jesse Owens's moments of victory, while Hitler was seen for only 15 seconds on the single occasion that he visited the Olympic stadium. Although the film was widely praised, its reception in 1938 was muted by Europe's gradual slide toward war. She was also met with hostility when she took the film to the United States in November 1938.         When Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, Ms. Riefenstahl went to the front as a war correspondent, but she claimed that she soon left in disgust at Wehrmacht brutalities. Yet the following year, when Germany occupied France, she sent a telegram to Hitler congratulating him on seizing Paris. ''Everyone thought the war was over,'' she later explained, and in that spirit I sent the cable to Hitler.''         During the war she continued to see Hitler sporadically but turned her attention back to filmmaking. Several projects fell through, but in 1944 she was able to complete filming of ''Tiefland,'' or ''Lowlands,'' an adaptation of the Eugene d'Albert operetta in which she also played the role of a Spanish Gypsy dancer. The film was shot in the Tyrol, and its extras included Gypsies interned in a nearby concentration camp.         After the war Ms. Riefenstahl insisted she had not known that the Gypsies were being detained prior to their deportation to Nazi death camps. But when in April 2002 she repeated the claim that none of the Gypsies had died, a German Gypsy Association, Rom, started legal action against her, arguing that at least half the extras were later killed. On her 100th birthday the Frankfurt prosecutor's office opened an investigation into charges that she had denied the Holocaust, but the case was dropped two months later for lack of evidence and because of her advanced age.         Ms. Riefenstahl said she saw Hitler for the last time in March 1944 when she visited him in Kitzbühel, Austria, to introduce her new husband, an army officer named Peter Jacob. She later wrote that Hitler had aged considerably and his hands trembled, but ''he still cast the same magical spell as before.''         Ms. Riefenstahl's only marriage lasted little longer than her numerous affairs during her time as an actress and filmmaker. At the end of the war, she was detained for almost four years for de-Nazification, first by the American authorities and then by French forces. She was found to be a ''Nazi sympathizer'' but she was not banned from working and was finally able to release ''Tiefland'' in 1954. But her movie career was over.       
         Eleanor Lambert, whose tireless promotion of American fashion gave the industry an international presence and helped to elevate it from rag trade to respectability, died yesterday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 100.         Often referred to as the Empress of Seventh Avenue, Miss Lambert looked the part with her trademark turbans and outsize jewelry. Her barrage of news releases and enthusiastic work as a publicity agent did much to further the careers of numerous American designers, among them Norman Norell, Bill Blass, Oscar de la Renta and Anne Klein.         Miss Lambert, who founded the Council of Fashion Designers of America in 1962 and ran it for more than a decade, had an almost unerring eye for recognizing future stars: Halston was one of them.         As might be expected, she had both admirers and detractors.         Her conviction that American fashion was important led her into skirmishes with the editors of Vogue and Harper's Bazaar, who in the 1940's and 50's concentrated on Paris as the capital of the fashion universe and on its designers as the leaders. As she began to make American designers better known, however, the influential magazines gradually began to cover them.         ''Her motto always was 'Don't look back,' '' said John Loring, a longtime friend and the design director and a senior vice president of Tiffany & Company. ''There were no rehashes or post-mortems. She didn't care a hoot about what was over, triumphs as well as defeats. And she not only wouldn't take no for an answer, she didn't hear it. Throw her out through the front door, and she'd fly back through the transom.''         In 1973, in a highlight of her career, she produced a landmark fashion show at the Palace of Versailles. To the astonishment of many of those present, the five American designers who were showing outshined the five designers from France. The Americans were Mr. Blass, Mr. de la Renta, Halston, Miss Klein and Stephen Burrows; the French designers were Givenchy, Yves Saint Laurent, Pierre Cardin, Emanuel Ungaro and Marc Bohan for Christian Dior. The success of the Americans helped further the reputation of American design.         Many of the innovations Miss Lambert introduced more than a half-century ago are an accepted part of the fashion industry, some in their original form and others revamped and revitalized. For example, in the early 1940's she originated the International Best-Dressed List, an expanded version of a Paris best-dressed list that was suspended during World War II. Although it has lost a good deal of its luster, it remains a coveted honor among women who are serious about fashion and who are backed by serious bank accounts. Nominations are made annually by fashion editors, many of whom have never set eyes on the women they are judging, and the list is then compiled by a smaller panel of editors and people of fashion. She handed control of the list to editors of Vanity Fair in 2002.         Miss Lambert's creation of the Council of Fashion Designers of America was the first attempt to bring together often warring designers, enabling them to present a united voice on issues that affected them and not incidentally to enhance their prestige.         In the 1970's, her influence within the council declined as the designers themselves became increasingly active in the association. By the 1980's, the council's activities had become glittery, with huge black-tie events and glamorous personalities whose only connections to fashion were that they wore clothes. Relevance was added in the 1990's, however, with Seventh on Sale, a benefit for AIDS research.         The prestigious Coty Fashion Critics Awards for design excellence, sponsored by Coty fragrances, were created by Miss Lambert in 1943 and were presented for more than 30 years. But as more designers began to market their own fragrances, they became increasingly unwilling to promote the Coty name. The awards were discontinued when Coty was bought by Pfizer, and in 1981 they evolved into the C.F.D.A. Awards, considered the Oscars of the fashion industry.         The Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art was another of Miss Lambert's projects. She was one of its early supporters after its creation in 1937 as a repository for important design trends, and she remained involved with it for many years.         In the 1940's, as the press director of the New York Dress Institute, Miss Lambert introduced the concept of fashion weeks, held twice a year in New York, to replace what had been uncoordinated showings by designers. Most of the important fashion and accessory designers took part, and the grouping of their individual shows enabled American and international fashion writers to cover the industry in a condensed period.         Although there were back-to-back shows both day and evening, the week was not unalloyed work for the writers; social events, sponsored by fashion personalities, were interspersed. The fashion weeks paved the way for today's centralized fashion shows, here and abroad. And Miss Lambert's own Sunday lunch, held in her spacious Fifth Avenue apartment at the beginning of the week for out-of-town fashion reporters and a group of her New York friends, was a tradition until several years before her death. After they stopped, she did continue her Saturday movie-and-dinner evenings for a rotating group of friends.         She credited her energy and youthful spirit in part to numerous visits over the years to a clinic in Germany where she was given live-cell therapy treatment.         Mr. Loring of Tiffany attributed her ''promotional know-how and her love of events'' to her father, Clay Lambert, a circus advance man. Mr. Loring, whose great-grandfather owned a circus, said he recognized circus artistry in Miss Lambert's ability ''to attract crowds and always display the next trick.''         In addition to her involvement with fashion in this country, Miss Lambert produced shows of American fashion in Japan, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Britain, Australia and the former Soviet Union, under the auspices of the Commerce and State Departments. In 1965, she was one of President Johnson's first appointees to the National Council on the Arts. She was, too, an early publicity agent for European designers like Valentino and Pierre Cardin, and she did much to help their reputations in the United States. In her later years, she also took on a number of socialites (always well dressed) as clients.         Miss Lambert gave up her office just a year before her death but still kept busy with a few accounts. ''I still have all my marbles,'' she said. ''I don't want to sit around waiting to die.''         Miss Lambert's first marriage, to Willis Conner, an architect, in the 1920's, ended in divorce. In 1936, she married Seymour Berkson, a journalist and newspaper executive at the Hearst Corporation, who died in 1959. She is survived by a son, William Berkson, of San Francisco; a grandson and a granddaughter; and two great-granddaughters.         Miss Lambert was born in Crawfordsville, Ind., on Aug. 10, 1903, and attended the John Herron Art Institute in Indianapolis and the Chicago Art Institute before moving to New York in 1925. After a brief period with a Manhattan advertising agency, she became the press director of the infant Whitney Museum of American Art, and later she helped to establish the Art Dealers Association of America. Her conviction that clothing design is an art form led to her concentration on fashion promotion. The sculptor Isamu Noguchi was an early client.         She had not always juxtaposed clothing and art. ''I still remember buying my first party dress,'' she recalled in a 1993 interview. ''It was yellow,'' she said, and it had black velvet ribbons on the sleeve. ''I looked like Chicken Little in it, and I thought I was the cat's meow.''       
         Carolyn G. Heilbrun, a retired Columbia University literary scholar whose extensive writings included pioneering books and essays in the feminist canon and a dozen highly erudite detective novels under the pseudonym Amanda Cross, died at her home in Manhattan on Thursday. She was 77.         Professor Heilbrun, who had written of taking her own life in a 1997 book, ''The Last Gift of Time: Life Beyond Sixty,'' committed suicide, said her son, Robert. She had not been ill, he noted yesterday. ''She wanted to control her destiny,'' he said, ''and she felt her life was a journey that had concluded.''         Aside from serving as an instructor at Brooklyn College in 1959-60 and as a visiting lecturer or professor at Yale, Princeton, Swarthmore and other colleges, Ms. Heilbrun spent her entire academic career at Columbia, joining the faculty in 1960 as an instructor of English and comparative literature and retiring in 1992 as the Avalon Foundation Professor in the Humanities.         But she was best known as the author of nine scholarly books, including ''Toward a Recognition of Androgyny,'' ''Reinventing Womanhood'' and ''Writing a Woman's Life,'' and scores of articles that interpreted women's literature from a feminist perspective, and as the author of the Kate Fansler mysteries. Her heroine, like her creator, was a professor of literature and a feminist.         The novels were ostensibly murder mysteries whose amateur sleuth sometimes sought clues in literary texts and a killer's motives in academic politics. Most were well received by readers, but some critics said the plots were thin and the social commentary thick, and that the real subjects were women's changing social positions, relationships with one another and struggle for independence.         The books offered scathing depictions of academic backbiting, observations on Ivy League social pretensions and thinly veiled, unflattering portraits of Columbia colleagues, including one professor who seemed to have been modeled after the writer Lionel Trilling.         Some critics complained that satiric wit and clever talk filled half a book before the victim fell dead, and that some of it sounded like an imitation of Oscar Wilde or George Bernard Shaw. But devotees said it was all good fun, and some compared her work to the cerebral puzzles of Dorothy L. Sayers.         Fearing that her mystery writing might be seen by colleagues as frivolous and might even jeopardize her chances for tenure, Ms. Heilbrun concealed the identity of Amanda Cross for six years. In 1964 her first novel, ''In the Last Analysis,'' was nominated for an Edgar Award by the Mystery Writers of America. ''Winning would have blown my cover,'' she recalled.         But after the 1970 publication of ''Poetic Justice,'' with its recognizable depiction of Columbia University's atmosphere after the student revolt of the late 1960's, Ms. Heilbrun's friends began to guess that she might be Amanda Cross, the author of three novels, including ''The James Joyce Murder.'' Later novels included ''Death in a Tenured Position,'' ''No Word from Winifred'' and ''The Puzzled Heart.''         Carolyn Gold Heilbrun was born on Jan. 13, 1926, in East Orange, N.J., the only child of Archibald Gold, an accountant, and Estelle Roemer Gold, who, her daughter would recall, ''sat at home and was bored out of her mind.'' The family moved to Manhattan when Ms. Heilbrun was 6, and she became a voracious reader, devouring Nancy Drew and Judy Bolton mysteries and, as a teenager, the novels of Virginia Woolf and Willa Cather.         She graduated from private schools in New York and from Wellesley College in 1947 with a bachelor's degree in English. She was married in 1945 to James Heilbrun, a Harvard student who became a professor of economics at Fordham University. In addition to her son, of Brooklyn, and her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Margaret Heilbrun, of Brooklyn, and Emily Heilbrun, of Eugene, Ore., and two grandchildren.         Enrolling in graduate school at Columbia, Ms. Heilbrun received a master's degree in 1951 and a doctorate in 1959. Her first notable essay was ''The Character of Hamlet's Mother,'' a 1957 article in Shakespeare Quarterly. It portrayed Gertrude as clever, not shallow, lucid rather than silly: ideas that were forerunners of feminism at the time, but hardly startling when the essay was reprinted in 1990 as part of ''Hamlet's Mother and Other Women.''         On the Columbia faculty, Ms. Heilbrun rose through the ranks: assistant professor in 1962, associate professor in 1967, full professor with tenure in 1972, Avalon Professor in 1985. In 1986 she became the first director of the university's Institute for Research on Women and Gender, which promotes feminist scholarship.         Her academic specialty was British modern literature, roughly from 1890 to 1950, an era that included Yeats, Conrad and Eliot, with a particular focus on the Bloomsbury group, made up of Virginia Woolf, Lytton Strachey, E. M. Forster and other writers.         Although she was widely respected by feminist scholars, she complained when she retired that she was isolated by her male colleagues at Columbia. ''When I spoke up for women's issues, I was made to feel unwelcome in my own department, kept off crucial committees, ridiculed, ignored,'' she told Anne Matthews in an interview for a New York Times Magazine article in 1992.         Throughout her academic career, and afterward, Ms. Heilbrun continued to write books and contribute articles to professional journals, newspapers and magazines. She wrote numerous book reviews and essays for Hers, a former column in The Times.         Her 1973 book, ''Toward a Recognition of Androgyny: Aspects of Male and Female in Literature,'' brought her to prominence in the academic feminist movement. Rejecting traditional ideas of male and female and using examples from Greek literature, the Bible and other writings, she urged women to escape from what she called the prison of gender.         Ms. Heilbrun drew on her long interest in biography and autobiography for her 1988 book, ''Writing a Woman's Life,'' her first best seller, which focused on women writing about themselves and other women. Even accomplished women, like Virginia Woolf and Eudora Welty, tended to judge themselves on how well they fulfilled traditional expectations, she concluded.       
         Thalia Mara, a ballet educator who helped found the USA International Ballet Competition in Jackson, Miss., died on Wednesday at St. Dominic/Jackson Memorial Hospital. She was 92 and lived in Jackson.         Born in Chicago to Russian parents, Ms. Mara trained with some of the great ballet figures of the 20th century, among them Adolph Bolm, Olga Preobajenska, Nicholas Legat and Michel Fokine. She made her professional debut in 1926 with the Ravinia Park Opera Ballets in Chicago, leaving after a year to join the Carina Ari Ballet in Paris.         Ms. Mara directed the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in 1947 and also danced there with her husband, Arthur Mahoney, from whom she separated in 1964.         The two founded the National Academy of Ballet and Theater Arts in New York in 1962. The school closed in 1973.         Ms. Mara wrote 11 books on ballet, many of which were dance students' easy-to-read instructional works, including ''The Language of Ballet,'' ''So You Want to Be a Ballet Dancer'' and the ''Steps in Ballet'' series. Many were translated and published in other countries.         Ms. Mara moved to Jackson, Miss., in the mid-1970's, at an invitation of the Jackson Ballet Guild to create a professional ballet troupe. She worked with the company for six years, resigning in 1981. A judge at the International Ballet Competition in Varna, Bulgaria, Ms. Mara worked with Robert Joffrey, the artistic director of the Joffrey Ballet, and the dance writer Walter Terry to create a competition on that circuit in Jackson. She served as the artistic director for the triennial USA International Ballet Competition from 1986 to 1994.         Ms. Mara founded the nonprofit Thalia Mara Arts International Foundation, which sponsored teacher training scholarships, a piano competition and performances in Jackson by dance companies and musicians. In 1994 the city's Municipal Auditorium was renamed Thalia Mara Hall.       
         Shirley P. Glass, a psychologist who strove to redefine the nature of infidelity, died on Oct. 8 at her home in Owings Mills, Md.. She was 67.         The cause was cancer, said Ira Glass, her son and the producer of ''This American Life'' on public radio stations.         In magazine articles, a recent book and interviews on ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'' and other television programs, Dr. Glass examined how the emotional intimacy of the workplace and the Internet had led even people in successful marriages to slip into emotionally intense relationships that could easily lead to affairs.         Dr. Glass said that even if these intense relationships did not lead to sex they were a threat to marriages and part of what she termed ''the new crisis of infidelity.'' The reason, she said, is that the emotional intimacy with the friend gradually, almost invisibly, supplants that with the spouse. Still, some critics questioned the utility of changing the traditional definition of infidelity.         Dr. Glass also made an impact among marriage therapists by saying that betrayed partners in adulterous affairs often suffered from post-traumatic stress similar to that experienced by combat veterans.         She advocated a new means of dealing with the aftermath of an affair: absolute honesty about every detail, down to sexual details if the wronged partner wanted to know them.         But based on wide surveys of other therapists, Dr. Glass found that it was most common to exclude the extramarital affair from the therapeutic discussion. She described this as ''waxing a dirty floor.''         Dr. John Gottman, a therapist and author who is executive director of the Relationship Institute in Seattle, said, ''This insight is threatening to everybody,'' but added that it was ''potentially very healing.''         He said that Dr. Glass's achievement lay in taking the moral component out of discussions of infidelity and treating it as an everyday, if exceedingly difficult, problem.         But it is a different kind of problem than commonly assumed, Dr. Glass argued. One of her findings, based on her clinical research in Baltimore, was that the majority of men who have affairs characterized their marriages, including their sex life, as ''happy'' or ''very happy.''         At the time of her death, Dr. Glass was beginning a more academic study to follow up her first book, ''Not 'Just Friends' '' (Free Press, 2003).         Shirley Bernice Politzer was born on March 1, 1936, in Richmond, Va. Her father ran a hardware store, and she grew up in the Pimlico section of Baltimore. She graduated from high school at 16 and from an honors course at the University of Maryland in three years.         She met Barry Glass, an accountant who became her husband of 48 years, at a swimming pool when she was 15. They married when she was 19.         In addition to her husband and her son, Ira, of Chicago, Dr. Glass is survived by two daughters, Randi Murray of Hillsborough, Calif., and Karen Glass Berry of Los Angeles, and two grandsons.         Dr. Glass taught high school math while earning a master's degree in psychology from Towson State University. Later, she was a psychologist in the Baltimore public school system. She became interested in the subject of infidelity after learning about a friend who was having an affair, and she pursued the subject in a doctoral program at Catholic University, where she earned her Ph.D. in 1980.         Mr. Glass said recently that he and his wife respected each other too much to have had an affair.         ''We were always the best of friends,'' he said.       
         Katharine Thomas O'Neil Bidwell, a patron of music and education who headed the Metropolitan Opera Guild in the 1980's, died last Thursday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 66 and also had a home on Fishers Island, N.Y.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Bidwell was born in Dayton, Ohio, and started a musical career when she joined the St. Louis Municipal Opera at 18. She graduated in 1959 from Sarah Lawrence College, where she became a trustee and sponsored programs in the performing arts.         She joined the board of the Metropolitan Opera Guild in 1966, became first vice president in the late 1970's and was president and chief executive from 1979 to 1986. After that, until 1996, she was the Lincoln Center's director of special projects.         For many years Mrs. Bidwell also headed the advisory council at the New York City Opera. She founded the Katherine Bidwell Foundation for Young Singers and the patrons' program of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, which she helped in commissioning new works.         She was also a trustee of the Greenwall Foundation, which supports emerging artists, Westminster Choir College and the London School of Music and Dramatic Arts.         el1 Mrs. Bidwell's first marriage, to Stephen E. O'Neil, ended in divorce. She is survived by her husband, J. Truman Bidwell Jr.; a daughter, Molly O'Neil Frank, of Manhattan; two sons, Stephen T. O'Neil, of Lookout Mountain, Tenn., and Charles Thomas O'Neil, of Stockbridge, Mass.; a brother, Charles Thomas, of San Diego; a sister, Frances Martin, of St. Louis; and eight grandchildren.       
         Audrey B. Love, a philanthropist and patron of the arts, died on Saturday at her home in Key Biscayne, Fla. She was 100.         Mrs. Love, who also had an apartment on Park Avenue in Manhattan, was the daughter of Edyth Guggenheim and Adm. Louis Josephthal, and was raised in Manhattan in a family devoted to the arts and philanthropy.         She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Smith College and soon afterward, on a trip to India in 1926, met her future husband, C. Ruxton Love Jr. Mr. Love, who died in 1971, was a Wall Street financier and diplomat, and the couple pursued a shared interest in collecting art.         In World War II, Mrs. Love served as president of the American Women's Voluntary Service. She was also a director of the New York Infirmary Hospital and a member of the Committee for Deaf and Dumb Children at Lenox Hill Hospital.         The Loves' collection of Napoleonic art was exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1978.         She was a founding member of the Lowe Art Museum of the University of Miami. Pieces from her collection of Georgian silver were exhibited at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in 2002.         Mrs. Love, who briefly pursued a career in the theater in her youth, was a lifelong patron of the opera. She contributed to the construction of the Metropolitan Opera in Manhattan. On an evening only days before her death, she was in her front row seat for a production of ''La Traviata'' by the Florida Grand Opera, which she had helped finance.         Mr. Love is survived by two daughters, the archaeologist Iris Love of New York City and Noel Gross of Saddle River, N.J., Wellington, Fla., and Bridgehampton, Long Island, and one grandson.       
         Marjorie Schlesinger Deane, who advised retail stores on fashion trends through an influential publication called the Tobe Report, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 80.         The cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease, her family said.         Until her death, Mrs. Deane was chairwoman of the Tobe Report, a weekly newsletter sold to retailers, where she had worked since the early 1960's. She stopped going to the office about five years ago, her son said.         ''I can remember tearing out pages and sending it to my people and saying we ought to look at this or that,'' said Marvin Traub, former chairman of Bloomingdale's.         She had previously worked as a fashion director at Look magazine and as an accessories stylist and senior vice president at Macy's.         Mrs. Deane was born Marjorie Schlesinger on April 18, 1923, in Manhattan. She graduated in 1943 from the Tobe-Coburn School for Fashion Careers.         In 1952 she married Disque D. Deane; they divorced in 1991.         Mrs. Deane was a former president of the Fashion Group International and a founder of the Council of Fashion Designers of America. She served on the board of the Fashion Institute of Technology and the Educational Foundation for Fashion Industries.         She was involved in numerous philanthropies, including the Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club, where she helped found the Kips Bay Decorator Show House benefit.         She is survived by her sister, Kathryn Michel, of Washington; two daughters, Gregg Deane Swain and Kathryn Deane-Krantz, both of New York; two sons, Disque D. Deane Jr., of Buenos Aires, and Walter Longstreet Deane, of New York; and six grandchildren.       
         Jane Evans, a former top executive of several large companies and most recently the managing partner of the Directors' Council, a company she helped form this year to help companies find women and members of minorities to serve as directors, died Nov. 16 in Buenos Aires, where she was attending a business conference.         She was 59 and lived in Paradise Valley, Ariz.         The cause apparently was bacterial pneumonia, said her husband, George Sheer.         Ms. Evans, at one time regarded as a prodigy in the field of traditional women's apparel retailing, more recently was associated with relative newcomers like Hypercom, an international provider of electronic payment and card processing systems.         At her death she was a director of Hypercom, Georgia-Pacific, the KB Home Corporation and the Altria Group, formerly Philip Morris.         She had been a Philip Morris board member since 1981, when she was the executive vice president leading the sprawling fashion group of General Mills, later spun off as Crystal Brands.         Jane Pierce Evans was born in Hannibal, Mo., and graduated from Vanderbilt University in 1965. A few days before her graduation, Genesco recruited Ms. Evans for executive training.         She rose from assistant to buyer for stockings, handbags and shoes. She became fashion coordinator for all the shoes sold by Genesco's shoe-making subsidiary, I. Miller, to Sears, Miller's No. 1 outlet. By the time she was 25, in 1970, she was named president of I. Miller.         Three and a half years later, Ms. Evans became president of Butterick Fashion Marketing, makers of zippers and sewing patterns sold under the Butterick and Vogue names; its corporate parent was American Can.         She left American Can and Butterick in 1977, saying they had become incompatible with her long-term career in women's apparel.         She went to lead the apparel group of General Mills where, as an executive vice president, she was responsible for fashion labels like Izod Lacoste, Ship 'n Shore and Monet Jewelers.         A headline in The New York Times in 1982 described her as ''The Number One Woman on Seventh Avenue.'' That year she joined women who were top executives across the corporate spectrum in the Committee of 200, founded as a power base for women in business.         In 1984, she became president and chief executive officer of Monet, a big maker of quality costume jewelry, and stayed on when General Mills spun off its fashion components. But in 1987, she suddenly resigned to look for other opportunities, she said.         Ms. Evans shifted fields to investment banking, becoming a general partner in Montgomery Securities of San Francisco.         But she returned to retailing in 1989 as president and chief executive of the Interpacific Group, an operator of hundreds of specialty stores under various names at resorts in Hawaii and the Far East.         Later, she was also chief operating officer of Gamut Interactive, a new-media service company in Scottsdale, Ariz. She was a member of senior management at US West Communications and, most recently, was associated with Opnix, of Tempe, Ariz., an Internet technology start-up.         Her last major project, the Directors' Council, was established this year in Phoenix and New York. Other founders included Christie Hefner of Playboy Enterprises, Marilyn R. Seymann of M One and Kay Koplovitz, former chief executive of USA Networks.         Besides Mr. Sheer, her husband of 33 years, Ms. Evans is survived by a son, Jonathan, of Tokyo; her mother, Kay Pierce of Columbus, Ohio; a sister, Judy Thompson, also of Columbus; and a brother, James Evans of Richmond, Va.       
         Linda C. Quinn, a specialist in securities law and an influential force at the Securities and Exchange Commission in the 1980's and 1990's, died on Tuesday in Dalton, Mass.         Her brother, Michael, said the cause of death was breast cancer. Ms. Quinn was 55 and had residences in Manhattan and Sharon, Conn.         During her 16 years at the S.E.C., Ms. Quinn oversaw regulatory changes that reduced barriers to foreign investment in the United States.         ''She was my most trusted adviser,'' Arthur Levitt, the former chairman of the S.E.C., said in a telephone interview.         Ms. Quinn joined the S.E.C. in 1980 and became executive assistant to the chairman, John Shad. She served as director of the division of corporation finance from 1986 to 1996.         Her principal legacies at the commission were a rule that made it easier for domestic and foreign institutional investors to buy and sell debt securities in the United States, and a regulation that streamlined the securities-offering process and made important changes to, and interpretations of, the S.E.C.'s disclosure rules.         In addition, Ms. Quinn's division set up Edgar, the S.E.C.'s electronic reporting system for public issuers of debt and equity securities.         She left the S.E.C. to join Shearman & Sterling as a partner. There she was an adviser to corporations on securities and capital markets matters.         ''I think she was the most important regulator and authority on securities regulation in the last 25 years,'' said David W. Heleniak, senior partner at Shearman & Sterling.         Ms. Quinn, who was born and raised in Rockville Centre on Long Island, was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Mount Holyoke College. She earned her law degree at the Georgetown University Law Center.         She is survived by her brother.         Correction:  November 15, 2003, Saturday  An obituary yesterday about Linda C. Quinn, a former official at the Securities and Exchange Commission, omitted a survivor. In addition to her brother, Michael, Ms. Quinn is survived by her father, E. John Quinn, of Amenia, N.Y.       
         Jenifer Estess, a theatrical producer who set up a foundation for research into Lou Gehrig's disease after she learned she had it, died yesterday at her apartment in Manhattan. She was 40.         The cause was amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or A.L.S., as Lou Gehrig's disease is formally known, her sister Valerie Estess said.         Ms. Estess was told in 1997 that she had the condition, a degenerative disease of the nerve cells that control muscular movement. It affects 30,000 Americans and is usually fatal within two to five years.         With friends and family members, Ms. Estess set up Project A.L.S., and, calling on her experience as a producer, she raised more than $17 million and brought together scientists from different laboratories to cooperate in the search for a cure.         The foundation paid for investigations into genetics, stem cells, gene therapy, accelerated drug testing and disease pathways. Some new approaches may help those with related conditions, like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, as well as brain and spinal cord injury, her sister said.         Jenifer Greer Estess was born on Feb. 17, 1963, in Moline, Ill., and grew up in Harrison, N.Y. After graduating from New York University with a major in drama, she worked as an actor. She helped found and was producing director of Naked Angels, a Manhattan theater company.         She then worked in public relations and helped found the Nantucket Film Festival and the New York Women's Film Festival.         Project A.L.S. has staged benefits involving show business celebrities in New York and Los Angeles, and in 2002 it arranged for Project A.L.S. Day at 14 major-league baseball stadiums. At each event, a celebrity read Gehrig's famous farewell speech, in which he declared to Yankee fans that he considered himself ''the luckiest man on the face of the earth.''         In 2001, Ms. Estess produced a movie for CBS television called ''Jenifer'' that told her own story. That year, she was named Glamour magazine's Woman of the Year.         Next May, HBO is planning to show a documentary about her.         The publication of her memoir, ''Tales From the Bed: On Living, Dying and Having It All,'' is scheduled for May.         Project A.L.S. will continue, Valerie Estess said.         In addition to her sister Valerie, who lives in Manhattan, Ms. Estess is survived by her mother, Marilyn R. Estess, of Rye, N.Y.; her other sisters, Alison Estess of Manhattan and Meredith Hulbert of Harrison; and her brother, Noah, of San Diego.       
         Elizabeth Stevenson, the first executive director of the National Brain Tumor Foundation, died on Nov. 30 in San Francisco, where she made her home. She was 57.         The cause was complications of pneumonia and of a brain tumor first diagnosed in 1979, her family said.         The foundation was formed in 1981 as a support group bringing together brain tumor patients, doctors and medical researchers. Ms. Stevenson organized the office of executive director in 1985 as the group expanded its fund-raising efforts for patient care and the search for a cure.         She stepped down in 1989 but remained a consultant and was on the board at her death.         Elizabeth Fullerton Stevenson was born in Bryn Mawr, Pa.; graduated from Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn.; and in 1968 received a bachelor's degree in history from Stanford. She worked at KQED, the public television station in Los Angeles, before heading to New York, where she became an assistant in the office of Mayor John V. Lindsay before returning to California in 1973.         There she worked for Representative Paul N. McCloskey as office manager and for Santa Clara County as director of governmental relations. From 1978 to 1982, she was director of public affairs for the Cowles Media Company in Minneapolis.         Ms. Stevenson was also a former member of the board of the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship.         She is survived by her husband, Francisco Cancino; two sisters, Sally S. Fischer, who lives in France, and Patience S. Scott of Riverhead, N.Y.; a brother, John R. Stevenson Jr. of Woodacre, Calif.; and her stepmother, Ruth Carter Stevenson of Fort Worth.         Correction:  January 1, 2004, Thursday  An obituary on Dec. 19 about Elizabeth Stevenson, the first executive director of the Brain Tumor Foundation, misstated the location of the public television station KQED, for which she once worked. It is in San Francisco, not Los Angeles.       
         Dr. Gisela Konopka, a pioneer in the study of troubled adolescents who provided groundbreaking insights on disruptive behavior among girls, died on Dec. 9 in Minneapolis. She was 93.         The cause was pulmonary edema, said Dr. Robert Blum, a friend and colleague, who is a professor of pediatrics at the University of Minnesota. The Konopka Institute for Best Practices in Adolescent Health, named for Dr. Konopka, is at the university.         A retired professor of social work, Dr. Konopka was the author of several works, including ''The Adolescent Girl in Conflict.'' The book, published in 1966, was one of the first in-depth examinations of the lives of troubled teenage girls.         ''All my life, it seems, I have talked about how people can't be bad just because they're black, or Jewish or women,'' Dr. Konopka told The Minneapolis Star Tribune in an interview for an article published in 2000. ''Well, they can't be bad just because they're young.''         Judith Kahn, director of the Konopka Institute, said ''The Adolescent Girl in Conflict'' broke new ground in offering girls a chance to present their own perspectives.         ''No one before had really listened to troubled adolescents and to what they said they wanted and needed in their lives,'' Ms. Kahn said. ''It wasn't just a look at the data, it was a look at what was underneath the data.''         Born Gisela Peiper in Berlin, she joined the resistance movement after Hitler came to power and eventually fled Germany, arriving in the United States in 1941. She met her future husband, Paul, in Germany before her departure, and they married after he arrived in New York a short time later.         Dr. Konopka received a master's degree in social service administration from the University of Pittsburgh and joined the social work faculty at the University of Minnesota in 1947. She later received a doctorate in social welfare from Columbia.         She remained a professor at the University of Minnesota until her retirement in 1978. Her husband, Paul, an engineer at General Mills, died in 1976.         She is survived by a foster daughter, Patricia Dreyer, of Minnetonka, Minn.       
         Hope Lange, a film, television and stage actress noted for a natural comedic style and intelligent portrayals of women in difficult circumstances, work that brought her two Emmy Awards and an Academy Award nomination, died at a hospital in Santa Monica, Calif., on Friday. She was 70 and lived in Los Angeles.         The cause was an intestinal infection brought on by a bout of diverticulitis, according to Ms. Lange's husband, Charles Hollerith Jr.         With her naturally blond hair, lithe dancer's figure and simple, straightforward style, Ms. Lange won praise for her first film role as a young woman who befriended a temptress played by Marilyn Monroe at a bus stop in the 1956 romantic comedy ''Bus Stop.'' It was her next role, in the controversial melodrama ''Peyton Place,'' based on the Grace Metalious book of the same name about the torrid lives led behind closed doors by the residents of a picturesque New England town, that made her a star in 1957.         In the film Ms. Lange played Selena Cross, a teenage girl living in a shack on the wrong side of town, who is raped by her stepfather and is later accused of murdering him. Her earnest portrayal of the troubled high school student earned her an Academy Award nomination as best supporting actress. She went on to act alongside Montgomery Clift and Marlon Brando in ''The Young Lions'' and starred with Joan Crawford in ''The Best of Everything.''         Ms. Lange was born in November 1933 in Connecticut to show business parents -- her father was a composer and arranger, and her mother was an actress. The family moved to Greenwich Village when Ms. Lange was a small child, and soon after Ms. Lange's father died, leaving her mother to support four children on her own. Her mother opened a restaurant, and Ms. Lange worked as a waitress. One day Eleanor Roosevelt, who had an apartment in the Village, walked by with Fala, her husband's beloved Scottish terrier, said Christopher Murray, Ms. Lange's son.         Fala was so entranced by the smell of the food cooking in the restaurant that he stood stock still, Mr. Murray said, until his mistress took him inside. Ms. Lange began walking Fala for Mrs. Roosevelt, Mr. Murray said, and was discovered when her picture appeared in the newspaper. She began modeling, which led to advertising work. Her first husband, the actor Don Murray, encouraged her to try acting, her son said, and Ms. Lange eventually began acting in films and later won two Emmy Awards for her portrayal of a widow in the television series ''The Ghost and Mrs. Muir.''         Ms. Lange's two previous marriages, to Mr. Murray and to Alan J. Pakula, the film director, ended in divorce. In addition to her husband, Ms. Lange is survived by her son, Christopher, of Malibu, Calif., and a daughter, Patricia Murray of Arroyo Grande, Calif.       
         Ethel Winant, who became one of the first female executives in network television when she was awarded a vice president's title at CBS in 1973, died on Nov. 29 at a hospital in Canoga Park, Calif. She was 81.         The cause was complications of a heart attack and a stroke, said Pam Dixon, a friend and colleague.         Ms. Winant was made vice president for talent and casting after having been director of casting for CBS in Hollywood since 1966. She was one of the network's strongest supporters of ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show,'' and helped to make Edward Asner, Valerie Harper and Cloris Leachman part of the ensemble.         When Ms. Winant (pronounced WYE-nant) moved to New York from California after World War II to find work on Broadway, she was hired as a production assistant for ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' and ''Death of a Salesman.''         When she visited the set of the CBS drama ''Studio One'' she talked her way into a job, and stayed until 1958, when she returned to California to work on ''Playhouse 90'' as casting director and associate producer.         Later she was casting director of ''The Twilight Zone'' and an executive producer of ''Hogan's Heroes'' and ''The Wild Wild West.'' In the 1970's, she oversaw casting for the hits ''The Waltons,'' ''Rhoda,'' ''Lou Grant'' and ''The Bob Newhart Show.''         In 1999 she was inducted into the Hall of Fame of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.         Ethel Wald Winant was born on Aug. 5, 1922, in Worcester, Mass. Her marriage to H. M. Wynant, who chose to change the spelling of his name, ended in divorce. She is survived by three sons, William Winant, a musician, of Oakland, Calif.; Scott Winant, a television producer and director, of Santa Monica, Calif.; and Bruce Winant, an actor, of West Milford, N.J.; and four grandchildren.         When Ms. Winant began her first vice president's job, she told of finding that the single restroom in CBS's executive dining room had a door without a lock. ''For a year and a half I would take the elevator down to the ladies' room,'' she said. ''One day, I decided to just leave my shoes outside the executive bathroom door. They got the message fairly quickly.''         Correction:  December 21, 2003, Sunday  An obituary last Sunday about Ethel Winant, a television executive, misstated her date of birth in some copies. It was Aug. 5, 1922, not 1933.       
         Dr. Elizabeth Bates, a leading expert on the way infants develop language and an outspoken critic of the theory that humans are endowed at birth with a language module, died on Sunday at her home in San Diego. She was 56.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, said Dr. Jeffrey Elman, a close friend and a colleague at the University of California, San Diego.         Dr. Bates, a professor of cognitive science at U.C.S.D. and the director of its Center for Research in Language, was known for her very public stance in the debate on nature versus nurture, that is, how much of human behavior is genetic and how much is learned from the environment.         Dr. Bates thought all development, including the acquisition of language, rested on a foundation of general mental abilities. For example, humans drive cars not because their brains contain car-driving modules but by using various visual, motor and focusing skills, which are parts of the brain's wider repertoire.         Language is special and unique, Dr. Bates said, but its specialness is derived from the interaction of bits and pieces in the brain that are recruited for many purposes. Defining language as ''a new machine built out of old parts,'' Dr. Bates spent her career working out the details of that concept.         In putting forth her ideas, Dr. Bates criticized the theories of the linguist Noam Chomsky of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and his colleague Dr. Steven Pinker, the psychology professor, now at Harvard. They contend that infants have a high degree of early knowledge and that development is more a matter of unfolding inborn traits.         Frequent sparring between the two sides, one based in California, the other in Massachusetts, led to the aphorism that much of cognitive neuroscience lay within the dynamic pull of a west pole and an east pole. Dr. Bates was ''queen of the west pole,'' Dr. Elman said.         Dr. Pinker said in an interview: ''As much as we locked horns, I had a huge amount of respect for her intellect and for keeping people like me honest. In anticipating her criticisms, she forced me to do better work.''         Dr. Bates conducted studies on more than 20 languages on four continents, showing how so-called universals of language like noun-verb agreement vary significantly in specific languages.         She studied infants born with extensive damage to the brain's language areas and found that their language abilities developed normally. In recent work, she found that there was a significant overlap in areas of the brain involved in processing language and areas involved in processing environmental sounds like trains whistling, cows mooing and doors slamming. She concluded that all these areas were specialized for meaningful sounds, not just language.         Elizabeth Ann Bates was born Wichita, Kan. After graduating from St. Louis University, she earned a doctorate in human development from the University of Chicago.         In 1983, she joined the psychology department at U.C.S.D. and in 1989 became the director of the Project in Cognitive and Neural Development at the Center for Research in Language. She wrote or was a co-author of 10 books, including the influential 1996 volume ''Rethinking Innateness,'' and more than 200 articles.         Dr. Bates is survived by her husband, George Carnevale, a fluid physicist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and a daughter, Julia Carnevale.
