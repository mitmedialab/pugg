         Sarah Pettit, a founding editor and former editor in chief of Out magazine, one of the first gay and lesbian publications with mainstream status, died yesterday at Columbia-Presbyterian Center of New York Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. She was 36. The cause was non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, her family said.         While attending Yale, where she received a bachelor of arts degree in 1988, she organized gay and lesbian cultural and political events. She moved to New York, and in 1989 became an editor of OutWeek, an alternative paper eager to bring a gay subculture to the surface.         In 1992, she joined Michael Goff in creating Out magazine, where she extended the magazine's cultural and political focus, and attracted a range of advertisers, including Calvin Klein and General Motors, that had not previously appeared in gay publications.         She became editor in chief in 1997 as Out magazine became one of the country's most influential gay and lesbian magazines. She was dismissed at the end of the year on the basis that the magazine wanted to change editorial focus. She sued, asserting sex discrimination and breach of contract. The case was settled out of court.         At her death, she was the senior editor of the Arts and Entertainment section at Newsweek magazine.         Ms. Pettit was born on Aug. 6, 1966, in Amsterdam, where her father, Frederick Pettit, was a banker. She spent her childhood in Paris; London; Bad Homburg, Germany; and Chappaqua, N.Y.         Besides her father, of Hillsborough, Calif., Ms. Pettit is survived by her mother, Jane Pettit of Washington, and two brothers, Benjamin Pettit of Washington and Baer Pettit of London.       
         Nearly 50 years after the death of her son, Emmett Till, who was murdered and thrown into a river in Mississippi, Mamie Till Mobley died here today, still clinging to the hope for justice. She was 81.         The Rev. Jesse Jackson, speaking tonight at a news conference on behalf of the family inside her home, said Mrs. Mobley had been having dialysis about three times a week for some time and that she suffered cardiac arrest today. Family members said she was rushed to Jackson Park Hospital, where she died about 2:30 p.m.         After the killing of her 14-year-old son in 1955 in Money, Miss., Mrs. Mobley allowed his mutilated body to be displayed in an open coffin during his funeral service, where mourners recoiled at the sight of Emmett's wounds.         His death came to symbolize the brutality in the racist South and became a symbol of the civil rights movement. Emmett was killed for supposedly whistling at a white woman, an act that in the Jim Crow South could mean a lynching for a black man.         Mrs. Mobley became an outspoken champion for children in poor neighborhoods and spent more than half her life keeping alive the memory of Emmett and the hope of bringing his killers to justice. At the time of her death, she was writing a book, ''Death of Innocence,'' which is to be published this fall by Random House.         No one was ever convicted in her only son's death, a fact that drove Mrs. Mobley to speak out about racial injustice for more than four decades.         ''It was very difficult; that's what kept her living all 81 years,'' said Airickca Gordon, 33, a surrogate granddaughter, who was reared by Mrs. Mobley.         ''Her ultimate goal was to bring justice for what happened to her son. She was constantly speaking on it, trying to get the story out,'' Ms. Gordon said. ''She was yet doing activist work. She never stopped. That's what kept her going.''         Ms. Gordon said she would most remember Mrs. Mobley for her spirit.         ''Her will and her spirit,'' she said, calling her ''a strong-willed woman.''         In addition to writing the current book, with Chris Benson, a Chicago lawyer and author, on her son's case, Mrs. Mobley is also featured in a new documentary, ''The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till,'' by Keith Beauchamp.         Mr. Jackson praised Mrs. Mobley as a woman of strength who did not harbor hate and who used her son's death to transform the lives of others.         ''She was still consoling and still teaching,'' Mr. Jackson said.         ''What must be put into perspective is that we often say the modern Civil Rights movement began with Rosa Parks in Montgomery. That's really not accurate,'' Mr. Jackson said. He said Emmett's murder ''broke the emotional chains of Jim Crow.''         ''Mrs. Mobley did a profound strategic thing,'' Mr. Jackson added. ''With his body water-soaked and defaced, most people would have kept the casket covered. She let the body be exposed. More than 100,000 people saw his body lying in that casket here in Chicago. That must have been at that time the largest single civil rights demonstration in American history.''         After Emmett's death, Mrs. Mobley recently told The Times, ''at first, I just wanted to go in a hole and hide my face from the world.''         But she said she soon began to talk about her son's death and to sound the call for justice.         ''It gives me a chance to get out what is clogged up inside, because if I don't talk, it stays in and worries me,'' she said. ''If I can let it go, even though I cry sometimes, I have some relief.''         She believed that her son's dying ultimately was not in vain. And despite what was done to him, Mrs. Mobley said, ''I have not spent one minute hating.''         Services are pending.       
         Mary Ellis, the young opera singer for whom Rudolf Friml wrote ''Rose-Marie'' in 1924 and who later became the queen of musicals in London, died there on Thursday at her home on Eaton Square. She was 105, including the three years that Hollywood publicists subtracted in the 1930's.         Her title role in the operetta ''Rose-Marie,'' her first venture into musical theater, was one of the biggest Broadway hits of the 1920's, running for 558 performances. Arthur Hammerstein, the producer, ordered it written especially for her, and long before Jeanette MacDonald's hit version of ''Indian Love Call'' from the 1936 film adaptation, critics universally hailed Miss Ellis's highly trained singing.         Her dramatic career lasted until she was 97, although she appeared exclusively in England after the 1930's, partly because of a breach with Hammerstein that kept her permanently off the American musical stage.         Her London stage consort, the composer and actor Ivor Novello, a leading rival of Noël Coward, called her his inspiration and built several hits around her. She also had a major London success with Jerome Kern's ''Music in the Air.''         Miss Ellis's glamorous circle included Fred and Adele Astaire, Harpo Marx and George Gershwin, with whom she fell fruitlessly in love. In her Hollywood career, Fritz Lang and Marlene Dietrich were her great friends. Her personal life was chronicled, husband by husband, in the press. ''We were all mad and in love with life and work, and each other,'' she wrote in her autobiography, ''Those Dancing Years'' (John Murray, 1982).         Miss Ellis was born May Belle Elsas on June 15, 1897, at 131 West 95th Street in Manhattan. Her name, considered too German sounding, was changed when she joined the Metropolitan Opera.         Her father, who had arrived from Germany with only a few coins in his pocket, eventually became president of Consolidated Paper Mills. Her mother showed promise as a concert pianist before her marriage.         Miss Ellis's parents wanted her to be a painter, but after hearing Geraldine Farrar sing, she once said, ''there was nothing in my mind but opera.''         At 18, she signed a four-year contract with the Met. She had important roles, including Mityl in the premiere of Albert Wolff's ''Blue Bird.'' She sang a minor part with Enrico Caruso in one of his last performances, in Donizetti's ''Elisir d'Amore,'' in Brooklyn in 1920.         Against all advice, she left the Met to act in Shakespearean productions on Broadway for the actor and producer David Belasco. That work led to ''Rose-Marie,'' originally about a sweet French-Canadian girl and her love for a fur trapper wrongly accused of murder. (The Canadian mountie, a minor role in the stage version, became the love interest in the movie, in which he was personified by Nelson Eddy.)         Miss Ellis left the show after a year to appear in ''The Dybbuk,'' a dramatic production at the Neighborhood Playhouse on the Lower East Side, where she happily traded a weekly paycheck of $500 for one of $10. Arthur Hammerstein was furious and forced her to sign an agreement preventing her from singing for any management but his. She never sang onstage in the United States again.         Miss Ellis had already been divorced twice when she began appearing with Basil Sydney, an English matinee idol, in productions that included a long-running modern-dress version of ''The Taming of the Shrew. They married on a whim in 1929.         There were professional tensions between the two, some caused by the offers she received to act in plays and films for which her husband was turned down. They appeared together in many plays in London until their marriage collapsed in a highly public divorce. But she was always busy with her own career, including a deal to make three pictures for Paramount.         Though her movies, including ''All the King's Horses'' (1934), were considered mediocre at best, her own acting and singing voice drew praise. Graham Greene lamented ''the waste of her sensuous appeal, her Bacchanalian gleam'' in that film.         She also appeared successfully in dramas, like the London production of ''Strange Interlude'' in 1931. But her greatest fame was in musicals, and by the late 1930's, she was one of the most popular stars of the West End, appearing in shows created by Novello and in costumes by Cecil Beaton. Some of the shows Novello wrote for her included ''Glamorous Night'' and ''The Dancing Years.''         During World War II, Miss Ellis spent three years working as an ambulance driver and a practical nurse. She went on to win excellent reviews for a string of postwar roles, including a leading part in Terence Rattigan's hit drama ''The Browning Version.''         She retired from the stage in 1970 but continued to act on television and in radio plays. Her last role, in 1994, was in the Sherlock Holmes television series starring Jeremy Brett.         Miss Ellis leaves no immediate survivors. Her last husband was Jock Muir Stewart Robinson, whom she married in 1938 after a hectic courtship. He was an enthusiastic pilot, skier and climber, and although she hated mountain climbing, she willingly accompanied him. He died in a climbing accident in 1950. She never married again.       
         Anita Borg, a computer scientist who devoted much of her career to the advancement of women in computer science, died on Sunday at her mother's home in Sonoma, Calif. She was 54.         The cause was brain cancer, said her husband, Winfried Wilcke.         Although highly respected as a computer scientist, Dr. Borg made her biggest mark as a champion and mentor of women in what has traditionally been a man's field. Through the several programs she founded, she became virtually synonymous with involving women in the emerging science.         In 1987, after returning from a technical conference where she was one of only a handful of women present, Dr. Borg started Systers, an electronic mailing list on technical subjects exclusively for women who are engineers.         ''Somewhere in the middle of doing all this technical research she realized that what she really wanted to do was not study computers but use computers to link people,'' said Brian Reid, who hired Dr. Borg into his research group at the Digital Equipment Corporation's Western Research Laboratory in Palo Alto, Calif., in 1986.         Dr. Borg was strict about who was allowed to be on the list, limiting recipients to women with highly technical training, and the discussions were rigorously confined to technical issues, said Maria Klawe, dean of engineering at Princeton University and a longtime friend of Dr. Borg.         ''When someone would go off topic, they would get a polite, personal message from Anita reminding them to stay on the subject,'' said Dr. Klawe, who joined the list 15 years ago.         The Systers list has since grown to include more than 2,500 women in 38 countries. Dr. Borg continued to run the list until she became ill in 2000.         Dr. Klawe, now president of the Association of Computing Machinery, said support from those on Systers helped her achieve that position.         Occasionally Dr. Borg loosened the rules to allow members to call attention to, say, advertisements that were demeaning to women. In 1992, when Mattel Inc. began selling a Barbie doll that said ''math class is tough,'' the voices of protest that started with the Systers list played a role in getting Mattel to remove that phrase from Barbie's microchip, Dr. Klawe said.         In 1994, Dr. Borg was co-founder of the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women, a conference held every two years focusing on the research and career interests of women in computing.         Dr. Borg left Digital in 1997 and joined the Xerox Corporation's Palo Alto Research Center. Soon after she arrived in her new job, she founded the Institute for Women and Technology, or I.W.T., a nonprofit organization, in part to encourage women to consider entering the technology industry, even if it meant learning new skills.         Anita Borg Naffz was born in 1949 in Chicago. Her first interest was in mathematics, said her mother, Beverly Naffz.         Dr. Borg's bent for computer science emerged while she was attending New York University, where she received her Ph.D. in 1981. Her dissertation was on operating system principles, a highly technical subset of computer science.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Wilcke, of Los Altos Hills, Calif.; her mother, Ms. Naffz, of Sonoma.; and her sister, Lee Naffz, of Leavenworth, Wash.       
         Jutta Hipp, a jazz pianist from Germany who had a short, celebrated career in the 1950's playing in New York nightclubs and making records for the Blue Note label, then turned her back on jazz to become a dressmaker, died on Monday at her home in Queens. She was 78.         The cause has not been determined, said Tom Evered, general manager of Blue Note Records.         Ms. Hipp (whose first name was pronounced YOU-ta) left Europe for the United States in 1955. As a young adult, she studied at the Leipzig Academy of Graphic Arts in East Germany, but crossed over to West Germany in 1946 after the Russians moved in to occupy Leipzig.         In an interview with Whitney Balliett of The New Yorker, she said that she had been excited about the initial postwar occupation of Leipzig by American forces. ''We were very happy at their coming and brought out all our jazz records to play for them,'' she said. ''No response. We were terribly hurt until we discovered what was wrong, which was that those G.I.'s didn't like jazz; they liked hillbilly music.'' She did not get along much better with the Russians, who wanted to put her design skills to work on propaganda posters.         Ms. Hipp had been playing piano since she was 9, and in West Germany she played in a circus and eventually at nightclubs.         In Munich she started her own small group, and around 1951 a friend sent a tape to the American jazz critic and record producer Leonard Feather. Feather found her in Germany in 1954 and arranged a visa for her to work in the United States. Once she was in New York, he booked her at the Hickory House jazz club.         She started playing at the Hickory House in March 1956 and stayed there for six months. Through Feather's agency, three records appeared in quick succession on Blue Note: ''Jutta Hipp With Zoot Sims'' and two volumes of ''Jutta Hipp at the Hickory House,'' with a trio including the bassist Peter Ind and the drummer Ed Thigpen. She appeared at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1956.         After spending time with her idols -- Erroll Garner, Lennie Tristano and Bud Powell -- she developed a style that was lean, percussive, swinging and interrupted with plenty of rests, not far from Horace Silver's style but more low-key.         In 1958 she stopped playing jazz because of low self-confidence, her friends said. After living for a time at a hotel in Manhattan, she settled in Queens and earned a living as a seamstress. Her friends said that they never heard of her performing again.         Her obscurity was so complete that Blue Note Records could not mail royalty checks because it had no address. In 2000 the label found her through the saxophonist Lee Konitz and his wife, Gundula. She was living alone in Jackson Heights, Queens, without a piano. The company presented her with a check for back royalties, amounting to $40,000, built up over years of sales, principally in Europe and Japan, of her three albums on LP and CD.         Ms. Hipp has no known survivors.       
         Dr. Judianne Densen-Gerber, a lawyer and psychiatrist who founded the drug treatment program Odyssey House and went on to give widely quoted but sometimes disputed testimony on subjects like child abuse and pornography, died on Sunday in Manhattan. She was 68.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter Dr. Sarah Baden, who added that her mother lived in Westport, Conn., and had come to New York for Mother's Day.         In 1966, Dr. Densen-Gerber founded Odyssey House, one of the earlier drug-free therapeutic communities that helped addicts recover. She was a leading advocate of such programs, which involved group residence and group therapy, as opposed to methadone-maintenance programs.         She got to know Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller when she picketed in front of his house to demand funds for her program, and they became friends. In the 1970's she became a conspicuous figure at public hearings, society balls and ghetto demonstrations with her bouffant hairdo, rhinestone-studded glasses and cigars.         A 1979 profile in New York magazine quoted Mayor Edward I. Koch as saying that she was ''one of those seminal forces, original, a go-getter.'' He said there were ''few people who can claim as many accomplishments.''         Dr. Densen-Gerber's success at getting government help became her downfall when the state investigated her use of public funds in the early 1980's and found irregularities. She resigned as executive director of Odyssey House in 1983, but remained active in affiliated programs.         Her influence extended to areas like child pornography. In 1977, her testimony that there were 264 monthly publications devoted to the subject helped persuade the House of Representatives to unanimously pass a bill to regulate it.         IPT, the publication of the Institute for Psychological Therapy, reported in 1992 that later government investigations proved her estimates to be exaggerated by ''several orders of magnitude.''         Dr. Densen-Gerber also commented on many other hot issues from a psychiatric point of view.         In 1991, she went to Omaha to testify in court that her interview with a man convinced her he had witnessed four satanic ritual killings. She characterized herself as an expert at deprogramming survivors of satanic cults.         In 1997, she appeared on Geraldo Rivera's television program to analyze a videotape of JonBenet Ramsey in a children's beauty contest.         Her unorthodox approach extended to her psychiatric practice. In 1999, she agreed to pay $200,000 to settle a civil lawsuit over her inability to account for 1,270 vials of medicinal cocaine. She denied any violation of the law.         She was born in Manhattan on Nov. 13, 1934. Her mother, Beatrice Densen, who had kept her own name, was an heiress of the Densen paper-box fortune. Her father, Gustave Gerber, a chemical engineer, became a lawyer in his 40's and was considering studying medicine in his 60's.         Dr. Densen-Gerber's parents persuaded her to study law before supporting her through medical school. She graduated from Columbia Law School and New York University Medical School. She did her residency at Metropolitan Hospital, where during one of her pregnancies, the director suggested she spend an hour or two a day working with addicts. That led to her assembling, in 1966, a group of addicts who wanted to cure themselves without using drugs. Before she found a home for them, they slept in 11 temporary shelters, giving rise to the name Odyssey.         Her original capital was $3.82, and dinner was often rice and spaghetti. Her first permanent building, on East 109th Street, was rented for $17 a month. There were 17 residents.         Within four years, other Odyssey Houses had started to spring up in other cities. In New York, Dr. Densen-Gerber reached out to new populations like prostitutes and addicted mothers.         Her own celebrity grew, and in 1981 The New York Times noted her costume at the April in Paris Ball at the Waldorf-Astoria. She wore a leather lionlike mask and a lionlike coiffure.         By the next year, Dr. Densen-Gerber faced stiff challenges. She agreed to pay back $20,000 in excessive personal expenses to close a state investigation. News reports suggested she had become intoxicated with her own power.         ''I remember her grandly lying back and being grande dame to all the peons who were lying around,'' Nancy Hoving, a former member of Odyssey's advisory council, said in a New York magazine interview.         In 1997, her marriage to Michael Baden, who had been the city's medical examiner and a top forensic official for the state police, burned out in a flurry of lawsuits and spectacular accusations.         The marriage's beginning had also been unusual. Mr. Baden said in an interview with The Daily News in 1989 that he took her to an autopsy on their first date and proposed by phone while assisting in the post-mortem on the bullet-riddled body of the mobster Albert Anastasia.         In addition to her daughter Sarah, Dr. Densen-Gerber is survived by another daughter, Trissa Baden of Hopewell, N.J.; a son, Lindsey, of Brookline, Mass.; and two grandchildren.       
         Katharine Hepburn, the actress whose independent life and strong-willed movie characters made her a role model for generations of women and a beloved heroine to filmgoers for more than 60 years, died yesterday at her home in the Fenwick section of Old Saybrook, Conn. She was 96 and also had a home in Manhattan.         Her physical presence was distinctive, her often-imitated voice filled with the vowels of a well-bred New Englander, and her sharp-planed face defined by remarkably high cheekbones. In her youth she did not have classical leading-lady looks, but a handsome beauty. In old age she was a familiar figure with her hair, gradually changing from auburn to gray, always in a topknot and her boyish figure always in the trousers that she helped to make fashionable.         She played sharp-witted, sophisticated women with an ease that suggested that there was a thin line between the movie role and the off-screen personality. The romantic comedy ''The Philadelphia Story'' and the screwball classic ''Bringing Up Baby'' were among her best, most typical roles. But through 43 films and dozens of stage and television appearances, she played comic and dramatic parts as varied as Jo in ''Little Women,'' the reborn spinster Rosie in ''The African Queen'' and Eleanor of Aquitaine in ''The Lion in Winter.''         Her life and career were dominated by her love affair with Spencer Tracy, which created one of the great romantic legends and brilliant movie pairings of their day. Tracy was unhappily married and the father of two when they met, and he remained married until the end of his life. He and Miss Hepburn lived together for 27 years, until his death in 1967, and made nine films together.         ''Woman of the Year,'' ''Adam's Rib'' and ''Pat and Mike'' are typically bright and biting Tracy-Hepburn collaborations. She is wickedly smart, slightly aloof and emotionally vulnerable. He is commonsensical, down-to-earth and deeply decent. He manages to bring her down a peg; she never minds.         Hepburn and Tracy, Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times, ''so beautifully complemented each other'' that their relationship ''never seemed to be a matter of capitulation.'' Rather, he added, it was ''a matter of understanding and acknowledging each other's boundaries.''         The frisson of their off-screen romance, always hinted at but never acknowledged during his lifetime, followed them on screen and became especially poignant when they played a married couple in their last movie together, ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.'' Tracy died just 17 days after they had finished filming it.         Through most of her career, Miss Hepburn had a reputation for being private and elusive with the press. In fact, she frequently granted interviews, although she was reticent about her personal life. But after the death of Tracy's wife, Louise, in 1983, Miss Hepburn felt free to discuss the love affair.         In later years she spoke openly about her life and career, especially in her 1991 autobiography, ''Me: Stories of My Life'' (Alfred A. Knopf). Although admittedly sketchy rather than a comprehensive memoir, the book captured the qualities that endeared Miss Hepburn to audiences: a conversational tone, a no-nonsense attitude and disarming candor. The autobiography became a best seller, a tribute to her enduring appeal across generational lines.         In 1993 she appeared in an autobiographical television documentary, ''Katharine Hepburn: All About Me,'' made for the TNT cable network. She began: ''So this is about Katharine Hepburn, public, private. Can you tell which is which?'' She added, laughing, ''Sometimes I wonder myself.''         Longing to Be a Boy         Katharine Houghton Hepburn was born into a close family whose comfortable social status and unconventional opinions fostered self-confidence and independence. Her father, Dr. Thomas Norval Hepburn, was a Hartford surgeon and a pioneer in fighting venereal disease. Her mother, Katharine Houghton, was a suffragist and a strong advocate of birth control.         In ''Me,'' Miss Hepburn finally revealed her age. ''I was born May 12, 1907,'' she wrote, ''despite everything I may have said to the contrary.'' For years she had said she was two years younger and had given her birthday as Nov. 8. That was the birthday of her older brother, Tom, who died at 16. Miss Hepburn, then 14, found his body hanging from the rafters of a house the family was visiting in New York City. The Hepburns said they never knew whether he had committed suicide and left open the possibility that he had been practicing a magic trick.         Although the family always called her Kathy or Kath, one summer Miss Hepburn so hated being a little girl that she cut her hair and called herself Jimmy. ''I thought being a girl was really the bunk,'' she said in an interview. ''But there's no bunk about Jimmy.''         After graduating from Bryn Mawr College in 1928, she had small parts in stock theater companies. She was dismissed from more than one play when she was starting out, but she retained supreme self-confidence. Late in life, she laughingly said of her younger self, ''I am terribly afraid I just assumed I'd be famous.''         She was first noticed professionally in her role as Antiope in the play ''The Warrior's Husband,'' a Greek fable in which she entered by descending a narrow staircase, carrying a stag over her shoulder.         That role led to a Hollywood screen test and her first film role, as John Barrymore's daughter in ''A Bill of Divorcement'' (1932). It was directed by George Cukor, who become one of her dearest friends (she and Tracy lived for years in the guest house on Cukor's Hollywood estate) and the director of many of her films, including ''Little Women.'' He once recalled of her screen test: ''She was unlike anybody I'd ever seen or heard. I was rather moved by the test, although the performance wasn't that good. But I thought, 'That girl is rather interesting.' ''         Fast Rise to Stardom         Miss Hepburn became a movie star quickly. She won an Academy Award for her role as Eva Lovelace, the naïve aspiring actress who learns a tough lesson about survival, in the 1933 film ''Morning Glory,'' only her third movie. Over the years she was nominated for a dozen Oscars, a record unbeaten until Meryl Streep received her 13th nomination this year. Miss Hepburn won three more, for ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,'' ''The Lion in Winter'' and ''On Golden Pond,'' but never showed up to collect any of them.         When she was 84, she looked back at those early days and, with her trademark tough-mindedness, said: ''In the beginning I had money; I wasn't a poor little thing. I don't know what I would have done if I'd had to come to New York and get a job as a waiter or something like that. I think I'm a success, but I had every advantage; I should have been.''         She also credited her husband with helping her get started in her career. For most of her life, the public thought she had never married. In fact, in 1928 she married Ludlow Ogden Smith, a member of a wealthy Pennsylvania family. She immediately made him change his name to S. Ogden Ludlow, partly because she didn't want to be known as Kate Smith.         They led separate lives long before their divorce in 1934, but they remained friendly. The town house they bought together in the Turtle Bay section of Manhattan was Miss Hepburn's home until the end of her life (along with the family home on the Connecticut River, to which she returned often).         In later years she expressed regret at the way she had treated her husband. In an interview that echoed what she wrote in ''Me,'' she assumed a self-chastising, no-nonsense tone and said she had been ''an absolute pig with Luddy, absolute pig.'' She continued: ''He was an angel. I thought of myself first, and that's a pig, isn't it?''         ''I would have been terrified alone in New York City,'' she said. ''We bought this house in '31, and then the minute I won the Academy Award, I got rid of Luddy.'' Many years later, not long before he died, ''I tried to make up to him for the horror I had caused him,'' she added. ''He was so generous-spirited that I don't think he considered it horror. He just considered it a kid who was wildly ambitious or something.''         Miss Hepburn is survived by a brother, Dr. Robert H. Hepburn, and a sister, Margaret H. Perry, both of Canton, Conn.; four nieces; and nine nephews.         Trousers as a Trademark         Despite her early success, reviewers in those days sometimes found her strident and mannered. In 1933 she returned to Broadway in a spectacular failure, ''The Lake,'' which inspired Dorothy Parker to write her famous aphorism, ''She ran the gamut of emotion from A to B.''         Of those early years, she said: ''I strike people as peculiar in some way, although I don't quite understand why. Of course, I have an angular face, an angular body and, I suppose, an angular personality, which jabs into people.''         Over time her screen presence softened and became more likable; meanwhile, society was catching up to her willful, independent style. She had been wearing pants, then considered quite unladylike, since the 1930's.         In her 1993 television autobiography, she recalled: ''I realized long ago that skirts are hopeless. Anytime I hear a man say he prefers a woman in a skirt, I say: 'Try one. Try a skirt.' '' Although her choice was based on comfort, her trademark trousered look became so influential that the Council of Fashion Designers of America gave her a lifetime achievement award in 1986.         Many of her early films are now regarded as classics. Playing a tough, determined actress in ''Stage Door'' (1937), she read a line from a play -- ''The calla lilies are in bloom again'' -- that became the all-time favorite of Hepburn impersonators. Life magazine said that ''Stage Door'' proved that she was ''potentially, the screen's greatest actress.''         She played a free-spirited heiress in ''Bringing Up Baby'' (1938), opposite Cary Grant and a leopard. But the film, now treasured, was a box-office flop, and by then her career was in decline. In 1938 she appeared on a list of actors labeled ''box-office poison'' in a poll of movie exhibitors.         Rather than appear in a film called ''Mother Carey's Chickens,'' she bought out her contract with R.K.O. She made ''Holiday,'' another classic romantic comedy with Grant, in which she was another high-spirited socialite.         Then Miss Hepburn took charge of her career in a way few women dared in those days of the studio system. Philip Barry wrote the play ''The Philadelphia Story'' for her, modeling his heroine, Tracy Lord, on Miss Hepburn. Tracy Lord is a beautiful, high-spirited rich woman, about to marry her second husband, when her first husband and a reporter who is covering the wedding arrive to create an unexpected romantic tangle.         The play was a hit, and Miss Hepburn owned the rights to it because Howard Hughes, a sometime beau, had bought them for her. She went to Louis B. Mayer, the head of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio, and sold him the property on the condition that she play the lead. She chose her friend George Cukor to direct. And she asked for Spencer Tracy and Clark Gable as her co-stars. She got Cary Grant as her former husband, James Stewart as the reporter, and a hit movie. She never lost control of her career again.         Soon she went back to Mayer with another script, ''Woman of the Year,'' the story of the unlikely romance between a hotshot political columnist and a sportswriter. She asked for Tracy, whom she had never met, to play the sportswriter. This time she got him.         A Loving Partnership         The success of ''Woman of the Year'' (1942) and the stars' off-screen relationship led to other Tracy and Hepburn films that followed a similar pattern. In ''Adam's Rib'' (1949), they are married, opposing lawyers, both nicknamed Pinky. In ''Pat and Mike'' (1952), she is a champion athlete, and he is her rough-hewn manager, with whom she falls in love.         The film was devised to show off Miss Hepburn's well-cultivated athletic ability. Almost to the end of her life she played tennis and swam, and in earlier years she golfed.         It was in ''Pat and Mike'' that Tracy spoke the often-quoted line about Miss Hepburn's figure, ''Not much meat on her, but what's there is 'cherce.' ''         Miss Hepburn often said Tracy was the best actor she had ever known and compared him in complimentary terms to a baked potato: solid, substantial stuff. ''He's meat and potatoes, meat and potatoes,'' she would say. ''I'm more like a fancy French dessert, I'm a little bit fancy, aren't I? But I wish I were meat and potatoes.'' Her other films with Tracy included the political dramas ''Keeper of the Flame'' (1942) and ''State of the Union'' (1948).         One of her most enduring films without Tracy was ''The African Queen'' (1952), in which she played the straitlaced Rosie opposite Humphrey Bogart for the director John Huston.         She wrote about it in her first book, published in 1987, whose title captures the direct, colloquial style of her writing: ''The Making of the African Queen: Or, How I Went to Africa With Bogart, Bacall and Huston and Almost Lost My Mind'' (Knopf).         Later she achieved one of her great artistic triumphs in an unlikely role, as the 12th-century Eleanor of Aquitaine in ''The Lion in Winter'' (1968). There was still something of the typical Hepburn persona in the steely manipulation and breaking heart of the aging, dismissed queen, but none of the actress's contemporary mannerisms.         Her versatility lasted well into her career. She played the distraught, drug-addicted Mary Tyrone in the 1962 film of Eugene O'Neill's ''Long Day's Journey Into Night.'' She was a fair match in toughness for John Wayne in the western ''Rooster Cogburn'' (1975). And in ''On Golden Pond'' (1981) she starred opposite Henry Fonda as a feisty older woman coping with her husband's failing memory and insisting that they should go on and live life to the fullest. In that role, the on-screen and off-screen Hepburn seemed to meld as easily as they had in her youth.         Her final screen appearance, in 1994, was a minor but tremendously emotional role in ''Love Affair.'' Playing Warren Beatty's wise old aunt, she gave advice to the woman he loved, played by Annette Bening. Miss Hepburn's age gave the role the trappings of a farewell to movies, but if she moved more slowly than before, in demeanor she was as game and modern as she had ever been, even venturing an unprintable line about ducks.         Throughout her career, she returned to the stage periodically. She appeared in ''The Millionairess,'' by George Bernard Shaw, on Broadway in 1952. In the late 1950's she also appeared in several Shakespeare plays in Stratford, Conn.         And in 1969, when she was 62, she made her singing debut on Broadway in the Alan Jay Lerner musical ''Coco,'' based on the life of the fashion designer Coco Chanel. She also appeared on Broadway in 1976 in ''A Matter of Gravity,'' by Enid Bagnold, and in 1981 in ''The West Side Waltz,'' by Ernest Thompson, who had written ''On Golden Pond.''         Her performances in all three of these plays were received with dazzling praise; the works themselves were treated more harshly. Walter Kerr of The New York Times wrote about her performance in ''The West Side Waltz'' in terms that reflected the general critical opinion: ''One mysterious thing she has learned to do is breathe unchallengeable life into lifeless lines.''         A Beloved Aunt on TV         In the 1970's she acted in television movies, including the Edwardian romantic drama ''Love Among the Ruins'' (1975), with Laurence Olivier, and ''The Corn Is Green'' (1979), both directed by Cukor. And in later years she kept busy with minor television movies.         She played a fictional version of the typically feisty Kate Hepburn character in ''Mrs. Delafield Wants to Marry'' (1986), ''Laura Lansing Slept Here'' (1988) and ''The Man Upstairs'' (1992).         In 1994 she appeared in a few scenes in the television movie ''One Christmas,'' as yet another wise old aunt. Her tailor-made Hepburn lines included these: ''I've always lived my life exactly as I wanted. I wouldn't change a single thing. No regrets.''         As she aged, she had some physical problems from which she recovered well. She had hip-replacement surgery and operations on both her shoulders, but she remained spry. Although her head shook visibly in television interviews from the 1980's on, she vehemently denied the rumor that she had Parkinson's disease, saying she had inherited her shaking head from her grandfather Hepburn.         Her most striking television appearance was not in a dramatic role, but in a 1986 tribute to Spencer Tracy. Speaking openly about their relationship at last, she read a letter she had written to him, which she later included in her autobiography. She recalled their last years together, when he was ill and had trouble sleeping, and she would sit on the floor by his side and talk. She wondered why he drank.         ''What was it, Spense?'' she asked. It was an eloquent and sentimental performance that distilled the way her public and private lives blended.         At the conclusion of ''All About Me,'' her own television biography, she said: ''In some ways I've lived my life as a man, made my own decisions. I've been as terrified as the next person, but you've got to keep a-going; you've got to dream.'' In typical Katharine Hepburn style, she faced the camera and, at the age of 85, tacitly acknowledged how close she had to be to the end.         ''I have no fear of death,'' she said. ''Must be wonderful, like a long sleep. But let's face it: it's how you live that really counts.''         With her angular beauty and unmistakable voice, Katharine Hepburn was a distinctive presence in films and on stage, whether sparring with a modern-day suitor or trading quips in Shakespearean dress. Here are some of the plays and films in which she appeared.

         Celia Cruz, the Cuban singer who became the queen of Latin music, died yesterday at her home in Fort Lee, N.J. She was 77.         The cause was complications after surgery for a brain tumor, said a spokeswoman, Blanca Lasalle.         Onstage, Ms. Cruz was a petite woman who wore tight, glittering dresses and towering wigs, dancing in high heels and belting songs that she punctuated with shouts of ''Azucar!'' (''Sugar!''). She was a vocal powerhouse, with a tough, raspy voice that could ride the percussive attack of a rumba or bring hard-won emotion to a lovelorn Cuban son.         ''When people hear me sing,'' she said in an interview with The New York Times, ''I want them to be happy, happy, happy. I don't want them thinking about when there's not any money, or when there's fighting at home. My message is always felicidad -- happiness.''         In a career that began in the 1940's, Ms. Cruz sang with every major Latin bandleader and recorded more than 70 albums. She sang a full spectrum of Afro-Cuban music, from the religious chants of santería to mambos and cha-chas to modern salsa. Yet unlike many of the Latin musicians in her wake, she didn't court a crossover audience. She recorded in Spanish, modestly saying that her English was not good enough.         Ms. Cruz was born in Havana to a poor family, and she regularly sang her brothers and sisters to sleep. She won a radio talent contest after a cousin took her to the radio station García Serra; first prize was a cake. She went on to study at the Havana Conservatory and to sing on radio programs. In 1950, she joined La Sonora Matancera, Cuba's most popular band. ''I wanted to be a mother, a teacher and a housewife,'' she told The New York Times. ''But when I began to sing with La Sonora Matancera, I thought, 'This is my chance, and I'm going to do it.' ''         She toured with the group constantly, sometimes singing five sets a day; they were also headliners at Havana's most celebrated nightclub, the Tropicana, and performed on radio and television. But in 1960, a year after Fidel Castro took power in Cuba, she was touring Mexico with La Sonora Matancera and decided not to return to Cuba. Years later, Cuba refused permission for her to attend her father's funeral.         Ms. Cruz moved to New York in 1961, and later to Fort Lee. In 1962, she married Pedro Knight, a trumpeter from La Sonora Matancera who became her musical director and manager. He survives her, along with two sisters, Gladys Becquer and Dolores Cruz.         In New York, she held on to her Cuban roots while adding some of the city's Puerto Rican and later Dominican elements to her music. She sang with Tito Puente's orchestra in the 1960's, a collaboration she periodically renewed through the next decades, and in the 1970's she also sang with bandleaders like Johnny Pacheco, Willie Colón and Ray Barretto. She performed with the Fania All-Stars at Yankee Stadium in 1975.         ''Women are afraid to sing salsa,'' she once said. ''I don't know why. Maybe they think it's for men.'' She added, ''But I think everybody can sing everything.''         She continued to modernize her music, working with Miami-based producers like Willy Chirino and Emilio Estefan and with Sergio George in New York, who produced her most recent albums. She also collaborated with many of the musicians who admired her, among them Luciano Pavarotti, Gloria Estefan, David Byrne of Talking Heads and the Brazilian songwriter Caetano Veloso.         In 1989, Ms. Cruz won a Grammy award for best tropical Latin performance for an album in collaboration with Mr. Barretto, ''Ritmo en el Corazón.'' In 1989, Yale University awarded Ms. Cruz an honorary doctorate (alongside Stephen Hawking), and in 1990 the main street of Little Havana in Miami, Calle Ocho, added the name Celia Cruz Way. In 1994, President Clinton gave her the National Medal of Arts. She won the first Latin Grammy Award for best tropical album in 2000. Until last year, Ms. Cruz continued to perform and record constantly on an international circuit that included jazz festivals and arena concerts along with Latin clubs.         She had surgery for a brain tumor in December 2002, but in February she returned to the studio to record an album, ''Regalo de Alma,'' that is due for release Aug. 5 on Sony Discos. That same month, her 2002 album, ''La Negra Tiene Tumbao,'' won the Grammy Award for best salsa album. In March, the Telemundo network broadcast a live concert tribute to Ms. Cruz, in which she performed alongside other Latin stars, including Marc Anthony, to raise money for the Celia Cruz Foundation for Hispanic students to study music. It will give its first five grants on her birthday this year, Oct. 21.       
         Carol Shields, the Pulitzer Prize-winning Canadian novelist who captured and illuminated the ordinariness of life -- ''domesticity, the shaggy beast that eats up 50 percent of our lives,'' as she put it -- died on Wednesday in Victoria, British Columbia. She was 68.         The cause was complications from breast cancer, which was diagnosed late in 1998.         In her 10 novels, 3 collections of stories and 3 volumes of poetry, Ms. Shields's subject was almost invariably the profundity of the mundane, the kind of subject matter that, she said, usually gets ''shoved aside by fiction writers.''         In her hands the commonplace turned into extraordinary, a skill that became evident to an audience beyond Canada with her seventh novel, ''The Stone Diaries,'' published by Random House Canada in 1993 and by Viking in the United States a year later. Narrated with humor and irony, ''The Stone Diaries'' traced the nearly nine-decade 20th-century life of Daisy Goodwill Flett, an ordinary woman but a pilgrim in search of herself. As well as a Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1995, the novel won the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Governor General's Award for fiction, and was shortlisted for a Booker Prize. (Dual citizenship in Canada and the United States made her eligible for numerous prizes.)         Earlier Ms. Shields had built a following with her novels and stories about ordinary people in everyday situations. ''Because she's a comic writer and genuinely funny, early on she was put in the 'sweet' box, where she does not belong,'' the novelist Margaret Atwood, a friend, told an interviewer. ''The fact is, there's a dark thread in everything she writes.''         Ms. Shields once explained her writing this way: ''My novels have centered on half a dozen concerns -- the lives of women, notions of gender, the force of time, the genesis of art, synchronicity, the relationship of fiction and biography.''         Carol Ann Warner was born on June 2, 1935, in Oak Park, Ill., the third child (after fraternal twins) of Robert Elmer, a candy factory manager, and Inez (Selgren) Warner, a schoolteacher. She attended Hanover College in Indiana, and after earning a bachelor's degree in 1957 she married Donald Hugh Shields, a Canadian civil engineer. They met while she was on a study-abroad program in Britain. The couple settled in Winnipeg and had five children -- John, Anne, Catherine, Meg and Sara. Her husband, children and 11 grandchildren survive her, as well as her brother, Robert Warner, and her sister, Barbara Hipple.         Despite the demands of domesticity, Ms. Shields kept writing poems and stories in what little personal time she had. She once described herself as ''the mother who typed.'' She earned a master's degree in literature at the University of Ottawa in 1975, writing a thesis on the Canadian writer Susanna Moodie. Material that she could not work into her thesis became part of her first novel, ''Small Ceremonies'' (1976), about a woman writing a biography of Moodie. She would play such literary games throughout her career, often borrowing from other writers -- like Margaret Laurence and John Updike -- and making her derivativeness a playful theme of her fiction.         ''Small Ceremonies'' was accepted for publication just as Ms. Shields turned 40, and it began her career. At first she followed conventional naturalistic forms, in ''The Box Garden'' (1977), about the unmarried sister of the protagonist in ''Small Ceremonies''; in ''Happenstance'' (1980), a pair of complementary novellas, one narrated by a wife, the other by her husband; and in ''A Fairly Conventional Woman'' (1982), about a woman who chooses her marriage over an extramarital affair.         But she grew impatient with the classic plot of the hero or heroine facing a crisis that worsens before it can be resolved. ''I wanted wallpaper in my novels, cereal bowls, cupboards, cousins, buses, local elections, head colds, cramps, newspapers,'' she wrote in 1998, ''and I abandoned Chekhov's dictum that if there is a rifle hanging over the fireplace, it must go off before the story ends.'' She continued: ''A rifle could hang over a fireplace for countless other reasons. For atmosphere, to give texture, to comment on the owner of the house, to ignite a scene with its presence, not its ammunition.''         She began to experiment in ''Various Miracles'' (1985), a short-story collection, and continued in ''Swann'' (1987), in which the relationship of art to its audience is amusingly explored in four narrative voices and a concluding film script. ''The Republic of Love'' (1992) played with the romance-novel form -- tracing a courtship with chapters that alternate between male and female viewpoints -- and won Ms. Shields a wider international audience. Then came ''The Stone Diaries,'' followed by ''Larry's Party'' (1997), which set out to explore, as the author put it, ''what it's like to be an ordinary, middle-aged guy at the end of the century.''         The year her first novel was published she began to teach literature, first at the University of Ottawa, then, in 1978 and '79 at the University of British Columbia, and, from 1980 to 2000, at the University of Manitoba. In 1996 she became chancellor of the University of Winnipeg, and in 2000 she became its chancellor emerita.         Her cancer was diagnosed just before Christmas in 1998. After beginning chemotherapy and recovering from the shock of learning she was sick (she spent a month ''just crying on the sofa,'' she told an interviewer for The New York Times Magazine), she finished compiling another collection of short fiction, ''Dressing Up for the Carnival'' (2000), completed a brief biography of Jane Austen for the Penguin Lives Series, and set to work on a 10th novel.         In an unexpected burst of energy, she completed ''Unless,'' a feminist story about a writer whose oldest daughter, Norah, drops out of college and takes up silent begging on a sidewalk with a cardboard sign reading ''Goodness'' hanging from her neck. The novel was published in May 2002 to favorable reviews. Ms. Shields was working on another novel at the time of her death, and research for it brought her back to Chicago, her hometown.         ''I believe in goodness,'' she has said. ''I'm amazed by the amount of goodness in the world.''         She appended this view later: ''I think that evil is the occasional breakdown of goodness, a very occasional rupture,'' she told an interviewer for Maclean's magazine. ''To me, it seems astonishing that people are as good as they are. That's the surprising thing.''         She added, ''I do feel this sense of goodness is part of our human condition -- the biggest part of it.''       
         Lucille Roberts, a businesswoman whose ambition to create ''the McDonald's of health clubs'' inspired a chain of bargain-basement gyms for women, died yesterday at New York University Downtown Hospital in Manhattan. She was 59.         The cause was lung cancer, said her husband, Bob. She lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Roberts built a chain of 50 gyms with 200,000 members in the New York metropolitan region by charging half or less of what many competitors asked. Her clubs were for women only, partly because she wanted to protect women from being ogled in coed gyms.         Mrs. Roberts said her target market was secretaries, teachers and the wives of policemen, and she said she knew how to please them -- an assertion the $50 million collected each year from members seemed to support.         ''It is only the upper classes who are into exercise for health,'' she said in an interview with The New York Times in 1997. ''The middle classes just want to look good. We have tried health classes. They just want to fit into tight jeans.''         Her business strategy involved recruiting as many members as possible and crowding them into large gyms. By continually adding more gyms, she was able to keep down the cost of advertising -- a significant and critical expenditure for health clubs -- on a per-member basis. The result was summed up by a promotional slogan Lucille Roberts used for years: ''More Gym Less Money.''         Ms. Roberts was born in the Soviet Union on Dec. 7, 1943, in what is now an independent country, Tajikistan. In an interview in Success magazine in 1998, she said her father lost a son in the war.         ''I became a surrogate son,'' she said. ''I never knew there was anything in the world I couldn't do. It was just a matter of when and how.''         Her family was Jewish, and, facing religious persecution in the Soviet Union, immigrated to the United States and settled in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn when she was 13. She graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1964 and worked in a succession of jobs in retailing.         The last was at Kitty Kelly Inc., which sold shoes and other merchandise. Mrs. Roberts was promised a $50 raise if she met a difficult sales target. She reached it, but did not receive the raise. She quit and started her own business with her husband.         In addition to him, she is survived by her sons Kevin and Kirk, both of Manhattan.         Mrs. Roberts hated to deal with inventory and wanted to find a business in which things like colors and sizes did not matter, she said in an interview with CNNfn in 1999. A self-described exercise nut, she said her first idea was to teach an exercise class for women at a hotel.         Instead, she decided that what women really needed was a place where they could exercise with no men around, The Wall Street Journal reported in 1997. She and her husband put up $10,000 of their savings, borrowed $5,000 each from their parents and opened a little ''spa'' opposite Macy's in Manhattan.         The club was an immediate success, but its name, the Body Shop, caused confusion: People thought it was an auto-repair business. Within two years, two additional clubs opened, and the name was changed to Lucille Roberts.         The overriding goal was to be friendly to women. No heavy weights or elaborate machines were emphasized; classes were easy to follow and taught by people with less-than-perfect bodies. The classes lasted only 30 minutes so they could easily fit into women's schedules.         The Robertses also invested heavily in real estate, buying whole shopping centers as well as individual buildings for health clubs. At the time of her death, they were about to begin selling franchises elsewhere in the United States, Mr. Roberts said.       
         Barbara B. Lazarus, an educational anthropologist who studied barriers to women entering science and engineering and created programs to overcome them, died last Tuesday in Pittsburgh. She was 57.         The cause was cancer, her husband, Marvin Sirbu, said.         Dr. Lazarus, who was associate provost for academic affairs at Carnegie Mellon University, was recognized for her creative methods of increasing the number of women in science and engineering at Carnegie Mellon and elsewhere. Her programs became models for other colleges, which often sought her help.         She also helped women's colleges in Asia find ways to help their graduates enter the work force. She combined her professional knowledge of the workplace with her personal experience with cancer -- she was first diagnosed in her early 30's -- to write about the problems cancer survivors face in their careers.         Dr. Lazarus started her work in Providence, R.I., in the early 1970's, developing materials to help telephone counselors advise women who wanted to enter or re-enter the work force. Later, as director of the Center for Women's Careers at Wellesley College, she adopted similar techniques to offer phone counseling to alumni who wanted help with their careers.         She also dreamed up a program now known as ''Explanatoids'' -- signs and videos at playgrounds, amusement parks and other sites to explain the science of everything from roller coasters to the curve balls being thrown at PNC Park, where the Pirates play.         The program will be extended to the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum in Washington this fall.         Dr. Lazarus is survived by her husband; two children, Margaret Ann Lazarus Sirbu and Benjamin James Lazarus Sirbu; her parents, David and Betty Lazarus of Urbana, Ill., and Chilmark, Mass.; two brothers, William of Washington and Richard of Cabin John, Md.; and a sister, Mary Ann Lazarus of St. Louis.       
         Dorothy Miller, one of the first curators hired by the Museum of Modern Art, in 1934, and the woman responsible for pioneering exhibitions of new American artists that helped propel generations of painters like Pollock, Rothko, Frank Stella and Jasper Johns onto the international scene, died yesterday at her apartment in Greenwich Village. She was 99.         Ms. Miller was a clairvoyant curator with unusually wide-ranging tastes. Her career began when American modernists like Stuart Davis were still young and lasted into the early heyday of Mr. Stella, Ellsworth Kelly, James Rosenquist and Claes Oldenburg. She included Mr. Oldenburg and Mr. Rosenquist in the last of her ''Americans'' exhibitions, in 1963.         The ''Americans'' shows began in 1942 with a selection of what were then mostly unknown artists of eclectic styles from across the country. The format was to have a select group of artists, abstract and figurative, each presented in some depth. The slender catalogs had statements by the artists. Typically, Ms. Miller wanted them to speak for themselves rather than presuming to speak for them.         She was invariably a step ahead of public taste. The 1942 show was panned. The museum's trustees were appalled. Some threatened to quit. Even Alfred H. Barr Jr., the Modern's visionary director, who otherwise supported Ms. Miller, quietly tried to distance himself from it.         Ms. Miller would organize her ''Americans'' shows at the last minute, to remain perfectly up to date and to keep secret the names of the artists until just before the opening. ''Congratulations, Dorothy,'' Barr told her after one opening. ''You've done it again. They all hate it.''         But over time, many of the artists she discovered came to be admired. ''I was fortunate to have two brilliant guides,'' she said, modestly, ''Alfred H. Barr Jr. and my husband, Holger Cahill.''         Dorothy Canning Miller was born on Feb. 6, 1904, in Hopedale, Mass., and was reared in Montclair, N.J. After graduating from Smith College in 1925, she enrolled in the Newark Museum apprentice program and was hired at the museum in 1926. There she met Mr. Cahill, a curator, with whom she worked on exhibitions of progressive American art that caught Mr. Barr's attention. He hired her. When Mr. Cahill was appointed director of the W.P.A. Federal Art Project in Washington in 1935, he asked Ms. Miller to join him. She declined, saying she had landed the ''best job in the museum world'' at the Modern.         Her first show there was about W.P.A. art. After she organized ''Americans 1942,'' she put together ''American Realists and Magic Realists'' in 1943, ''Fourteen Americans'' in 1946, ''Fifteen Americans'' in 1952, ''Twelve Americans'' in 1956, ''Sixteen Americans'' in 1959 and her last ''Americans'' show in 1963. The 1946 show included Gorky, Isamu Noguchi and Robert Motherwell; the 1952 show had Pollock, Rothko and Clyfford Still; the 1956 show introduced Larry Rivers and Grace Hartigan to a wide public; the 1959 show had Mr. Stella, Louise Nevelson, Jay de Feo, Robert Rauschenberg and Mr. Johns. The 1963 show, besides Mr. Oldenburg and Mr. Kelly, featured Cryssa, Lee Bontecou, Richard Lindner and Robert Indiana. Reviewing it in The New York Times, John Canaday said it answered ''the 30-year-old question of what ever happened to vaudeville. It moved to the Museum of Modern Art.''         The most influential exhibition that Ms. Miller organized was surely ''The New American Painting,'' which toured Europe in 1958 and 1959.         It significantly changed European perceptions of American art, putting Abstract Expressionism on the map there once and for all.         In 1969 Ms. Miller retired from the Modern and became an adviser to various corporate collections and, with Eleanor Price Mather, was co-author of ''Edward Hicks: His Peaceable Kingdom and Other Paintings,'' about the early 19th-century American folk artist. She is survived by a stepdaughter, Jane Cahill Blumenfeld of Albuquerque, N.M.; a niece, Edith White Danton of Osterville, Mass.; and a nephew, Reid White of Lenox, Mass.         Russell Lynes, in his history of the Modern, said Ms. Miller was ''looked upon by artists either as a benign goddess or as a disdainful one, depending on whether or not she smiled on their work.''         Mr. Stella said yesterday: ''She was a straight shooter, very respectful of the art and the artists and the museum, something you don't get that much of anymore. The 'Americans' shows set the tone for my time. You were either in or you were not. They were exhibitions of what was going on, pointing to the future, and they were definitive. Or if they weren't definitive, they were certainly exciting.''       
         Isabelle d'Orléans et Bragance, Countess of Paris, who was married to a pretender to the throne of France, died on July 5 in Paris. She was 93.         The countess was the widow of Henri, Count of Paris, whom many royalists wanted to become King Henri VI of France. He died in 1999, and the couple's eldest son, also called Henri, claimed the title of Count of Paris and Duke of France, becoming the new pretender.         Her full name was originally Isabel Marie Amélie Louise Victoire Thérèse Jeanne of Orléans and Bragana, or Bragance in French. A granddaughter of the last empress of Brazil, she was born in France at the home of her paternal grandparents, in the Seine-Maritime region.         Her parents were Prince Pedro de Alcantara of Orléans and Bragana, Prince of Grão Pará, and Dona Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil. The family having been exiled from Brazil, the younger Isabel was educated in France.         The countess first met her future husband while still a child. Their engagement was made public in 1930 in Belgium, to which his family had long been banished. For political reasons, the wedding took place in Palermo the next year, with other European royalty and throngs of French royalists in attendance.         At the time, Henri's father headed what many French monarchists still considered the royal house of France. The royal family of Bourbon had been driven from France by law in 1886 and were forbidden even to visit until 1950.         The couple began married life in Belgium, where the count ran two newspapers. From 1932 to 1948, the countess bore five sons and six daughters, most of whom married into their own social class. Two of the sons died, in 1960 and 1983.         The couple lived at various times in Brazil, Morocco, Spain and Portugal before France revoked the 1886 Law of Exile in 1950. Then, living just outside Paris, the count ventured into politics, proclaiming his loyalty to democracy, and she took her place in Paris society.         The countess wrote two books of memoirs as well as some biographical and historical writings about her family.         Correction:  July 31, 2003, Thursday  An obituary of the Countess of Paris on July 14 misspelled the English-language version of her name. She was Isabel of Orléans and Braganza, not Bragana.       
         Lady Diana Mosley, one of the famous Mitford sisters and a glamorous 1930's socialite who scandalously abandoned her husband, embraced fascism and married Sir Oswald Mosley, leader of the British Union of Fascists, died in Paris on Monday, her family said. She was 93.         A spokeswoman for her sister, the Duchess of Devonshire, told the BBC, ''We can confirm that she died peacefully, but we cannot say any more than that.''         Lady Mosley's stubborn fascism and her unrepentant admiration for Hitler -- he and Josef Goebbels were guests at her wedding to Sir Oswald, in Berlin in 1936 -- made her a figure of hate to the British during World War II, and to some extent for the rest of her life. Judged a danger to her country, she spent two and a half years in Holloway Prison in London while war raged on the Continent.         After the war, she and Sir Oswald, who also served time in Holloway, moved to Orsay, Paris, where they lived happily, and only partly in disgrace, for the rest of their lives (he died in 1980). Although shunned by the British establishment -- British ambassadors to France were instructed not to invite her to the embassy, for instance -- Lady Mosley presided over a beautifully decorated house, Temple de la Gloire, where she gardened, wrote, read, gave interviews, kept up on London literary gossip and entertained an endless stream of glittery visitors who were, inevitably, thoroughly enchanted by her quick wit, sparkling appearance, and sly sense of humor.         She was one of the few people ever to maintain simultaneous friendships with Hitler and Churchill.         ''There were so many paradoxes about this most beautiful, most intelligent, and most beguiling of the celebrated Mitford sisters,'' the novelist and critic A. N. Wilson, a friend of Lady Mosley, wrote in The Daily Telegraph. Also in The Daily Telegraph, the historian Andrew Roberts described succumbing, however unwillingly, ''to the full force of her Mitfordesque charm,'' even as Lady Mosley calmly announced that although Hitler ''was to blame for the extermination of the Jews,'' he was also perhaps the most attractive man she had ever met.         Lady Diana Mosley was born the Honorable Diana Mitford in 1910, the third of the six Mitford girls (a brother, Tom, was killed in World War II). They were fabled for their wit and luminous looks -- each one seemed to glitter more brightly than the next -- and their eccentric upbringing was immortalized in various books, including the novels ''The Pursuit of Love,'' ''Love in a Cold Climate,'' and others by Nancy Mitford; and ''Hons and Rebels,'' a memoir by Jessica Mitford. Their father was Lord Redesdale, a blustery country aristocrat with little money and old-fashioned views, fond of outdoor pursuits and famously bad-tempered about the outside society for which his daughters longed.         They found it, in wildly different ways. Nancy, an intimate of Evelyn Waugh, became a hugely successful novelist and essayist and ardent anti-fascist. Jessica became a Communist, running away from home to join Esmond Romilly, a wastrel nephew of Churchill, who had gone to Spain to work as a journalist in the Spanish Civil War (she later settled in the United States and wrote ''The American Way of Death,'' a brilliantly acerbic analysis of the American funeral industry, among other things).         Unity, another sister, became a fanatical fascist, befriended Hitler and was so distraught when Britain entered World War II that she shot herself in the head, botching the suicide attempt but suffering extensive brain damage. Deborah, another sister, married the Duke of Devonshire, one of the best catches in all of British bachelorhood.         In a family of dazzling girls, Diana dazzled perhaps the brightest. ''She was the nearest thing to Botticelli's Venus that I have ever seen,'' wrote James Lees-Milne, a family friend; Evelyn Waugh, who dedicated ''Vile Bodies'' to her, said that her beauty ''ran through the room like a peal of bells.'' At 18, she became engaged after a few weeks' acquaintance to the brewing heir Bryan Guinness, a match that seemed objectionable only to her mother -- he was ''so frightfully rich,'' Lady Redesdale said.         The two quickly had two sons. With her beauty and wit, and his money, the Guinnesses became the center of young London society, but Diana wanted more. In 1932, she left her husband for Oswald Mosley, the strikingly attractive leader of the fledgling British Union of Fascists, a bold step, not least because he was still married (his wife conveniently died, of peritonitis, the following year).         Diana threw herself into her lover's cause, hoping to effect amity between fascist Germany and Britain. After the two were married, in 1936, Diana Mosley had two more sons, and devoted herself to raising them. She was arrested and jailed in 1940, when the second was just a baby. Though the prison years were miserable, she tried to make light of them after the fact, as she did about her exile in Paris.         ''The story about us being pariahs and all that, it's all nonsense really,'' she told an interviewer last year. ''I've never had rudeness or disagreeableness ever. At meetings there were rows with Communists and so on. If you met the Communists at dinner, you wouldn't have a row.''         Sir Oswald Mosley, a hereditary baronet, died in 1980, and Lady Mosley never remarried. She reconciled with her sister Nancy, nursing her through the cancer that led to Nancy's death in 1973, and made peace with some, but by no means all, of her other relatives. Through it all, she was always impeccably dressed, always a gracious hostess, and always intellectually vigorous, contributing book reviews to The Times of London, the Evening Standard, and the Spectator, among other publications, and answering frankly and unflinchingly when interviewers and historians made pilgrimages to Paris to ask her about the old days.         She is survived by a far-flung extended family, including the Duchess of Devonshire, her last surviving sister; four sons, two by each of her husbands; and a large number of grandchildren and great-grandchildren.         She remained passionate about Sir Oswald, the love of her life, to the end. ''He appeared to me then as he does still, the cleverest, most balanced, and most honest of all English politicians,'' she said in her memoir, ''A Life of Contrasts.'' Nor did she ever fully denounce Hitler -- she was too stubbornly loyal to her beliefs and her behavior for that, her friends believe -- although she deplored his excesses.         ''We all know that he was a monster, that he was cruel and did terrible things,'' she said. ''But that doesn't alter the fact that he was obviously an interesting figure.''         She added, in an interview in 2000: ''I was very fond of him. Very, very fond.''         Correction:  September 9, 2003, Tuesday  An obituary on Aug. 14 about Diana Mosley, the British aristocrat who was a staunch supporter of Hitler and fascism, referred incompletely to Esmond Romilly, who had married one of her sisters, Jessica Mitford. Although Mr. Romilly was a rebellious young man of privilege, he also became a published writer and an ardent anti-fascist who fought against Franco in Spain and, while serving in the Royal Canadian Air Force, died in 1941, at 23, in a bombing raid against Nazi Germany.       
         Laura Rapaport Borsten, who was in the first group of 40 recruits accepted to be a Wave, a member of the women's Navy corps, died on Aug. 11 at a hospital in Los Angeles. She was 91.         Her husband, Orin, said Mrs. Borsten, who lived in Los Angeles, kept up with other veterans and believed she was the last surviving member of the first group, made up of officer trainees.         Lt. Billy Ray Davis, a Navy spokesman, confirmed that Mrs. Borsten, then Laura Rapaport, joined as one of the first 40 Waves on Aug. 28, 1942. She rose to the rank of lieutenant commander.         President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the law creating the Women's Reserve of the Navy on July 30, 1942. The corps was soon christened Waves, for Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service. Capt. Mildred McAfee, first director of the corps, suggested that it really meant ''Women Are Very Essential Sometimes.''         Organized to allow more men to be available for combat, women soon filled jobs like repairing aircraft, breaking enemy codes and serving as gunnery instructors. Many did clerical work.         Before the Waves, neither the women who served in World War I nor Navy nurses were permitted to become officers. Mrs. Borsten and her fellow officer trainees were greeted by newsreel cameras and autograph hunters when they reported for training at Smith College in Northampton, Mass.         By the end of the war, there were 8,000 Wave officers and 76,000 enlisted Waves. Though the name Wave was dropped in 1972, Navy women have gone on to command battleships and fighter squadrons, and rise to the rank of three-star admiral.         But they presented challenges to military tradition. For example, Miss McAfee decreed that Waves would be allowed to wear enough makeup ''to look human.''         Laura Golde Rapaport was born on a farm in McIntosh County, N.D., on Feb. 29, 1912.         She graduated from the University of Minnesota with honors in library science. Just as she was starting a job in adult education, Leo W. Schwarz, an author and lecturer on Jewish concerns, met her in Minneapolis. He asked her if she wanted a job in New York City.         She became director of international relations and social relations for the National Council of Jewish Women, and, among other things, helped bring Jews out of Hitler's Germany. In 1938, she testified a Senate committee against the equal-rights amendment, saying that it might jeopardize the gains women had made in areas like widows' pensions.         In 1942, she received a call from Elizabeth Reynard, a Barnard professor who was to become assistant director of the Waves. Professor Reynard said that Miss McAfee, who was to become Waves director, wondered if she was interested in joining.         Like most of the original 40 officer candidates, all of whom had distinguished themselves professionally, Miss Rapaport had no idea why she was asked.         After training at Smith, Miss Rapaport was selected to teach the 750 women arriving for officers' training. She was then assigned to teach officers and enlisted Waves at U.S.S. Hunter, the name the Navy had given Hunter College in the Bronx. She succeeded in her quiet campaign to recruit black officers, and helped forestall a proposal for segregated platoons.         Her last assignment was in Hawaii, the first posting of Waves outside the continental United States. As a transportation officer there, she learned to drive.         After her discharge, she visited her sister in Los Angeles. On a street corner, she saw Mr. Borsten, whom she had dated before the war. They were married a few months later.         In addition to him, Mrs. Borsten is survived by a son, Joseph Borsten of Los Angeles; a daughter, Joan Borsten Vidov of Los Angeles; a sister, Lillian Minkowski of Santa Cruz; and a grandson.       
         Connie Reeves, who was very likely America's oldest cowgirl, died in San Antonio on Aug. 17, 12 days after she was thrown from her horse, Dr Pepper. She was 101.         She was riding her favorite horse, a 28-year-old paint, on the morning of Aug. 5 when Dr Pepper threw her over its head. Her neck was broken, but she was not paralyzed, The Kerrville (Tex.) Daily Times reported. The Associated Press said she died of cardiac arrest.         Meg Clark, owner of Camp Waldemar in the Texas Hill Country, where Mrs. Reeves taught riding for 67 years, said she had been riding more this year than in previous years and was delighted that Dr Pepper remained so spirited.         ''That was how she wanted to live her life, and that was how she wanted to end it,'' Ms. Clark said on Wednesday. ''She wanted to be on horseback.''         As a baby, Mrs. Reeves was photographed on a horse -- as well as on a cow, something she could never quite explain -- and went on to manage a ranch and teach about 30,000 girls to ride over the years at a summer camp. She could herd steers, shear sheep, kill rattlesnakes and cook for hungry cowhands.         At first she did not think she deserved to be inducted into the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame in 1997, but then decided she had as much right as the next lady, given the things she had done and the things she knew.         She knew, for example, that a horse could smell fear. When she ended up with one leg shorter than the other after falling from a horse, she did the sensible thing: she had the heel of one cowboy boot raised.         Mrs. Reeves's greatest fame came last year when Justice Sandra Day O'Connor of the United States Supreme Court was inducted into the Cowgirl Hall of Fame in Fort Worth. Reporters could not resist interviewing the hall's oldest member, whom the event's organizers were more than willing to make available.         After all, a quotation from Mrs. Reeves, ''Always saddle your own horse,'' had almost become the hall's motto. Liz Smith began a gossip column by suggesting, ''It's not a bad motto, even if you are just getting into your Mercedes.''         Many things Mrs. Reeves did seemed to make history, particularly in Texas.         She was one of the first women to study law at the University of Texas, and she started one of the state's first girls' drill teams, a movement that grew into a Texas passion. The 10,000-acre ranch she and her husband managed was owned by Lyndon B. Johnson.         In 1998, Mrs. Reeves won the Chester A. Reynolds Award for major contributions to the Western way of life from the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, one of two women to do so.         Constance Douglas was born on Sept. 26, 1901, in Eagle Pass, Tex., on the Mexican border. She swam in the Rio Grande and rode horses with cowboys. Her grandfather gave her her first horse when she was 5. The family moved to San Antonio when she was 16.         Her father was a lawyer, and her mother was so genteel that she refused to go to the grocer's without gloves and a hat.         Mrs. Reeves graduated from Texas Women's University in Denton as a speech major and then attended the University of Texas School of Law, but left to take a job because her family was short of money in the Depression. She taught at two San Antonio high schools. At one, Thomas Jefferson High, she founded a drill team called the Lassos, which is still in existence.         She also started a riding stable to teach city boys and girls how to ride and care for horses. Although the stables were successful, she accepted a position as riding instructor at Camp Waldemar in 1936 for $50 a summer. She eventually taught Western and English riding styles to the granddaughters of her original students.         She came to the conclusion that horses respond best to women.         ''The harsh voices and rough bark of boys and men seem to frighten horses,'' she wrote several weeks before her death in a script for a video about riding. ''The same horse that refused to take the bit in its mouth will accept it from the more gentle hands of a girl.''         At the camp she met Jack Reeves, a former rodeo star, trick rider and keeper of the camp's horses. They married in 1942; he died in 1985. They had no children, and she left no immediate survivors.         ''I'm sure glad I don't have grandchildren,'' she said in an interview with The Associated Press last year. ''The world today, it's disturbed.''         The cowgirl found her own peace on a horse.         ''I still ride alone,'' Mrs. Reeves said in an interview with National Public Radio last year. ''Sometimes I'll just get on the horse and go down to the river. We'll just ride up and watch a little baby fawn nursing or watch the birds in a nest.         ''As long as I'm alive, I'm going to be trying to ride a horse.''       
         Althea Gibson emerged in the tennis world of the 1950's as a most unlikely queen of the lawns of Wimbledon and Forest Hills.         In 1950 she became the first black to compete in the United States nationals. She won 56 tournaments, including five Grand Slam singles titles -- the United States nationals and Wimbledon twice, in 1957 and 1958, and the French championship in 1956.         What made that especially remarkable was her background as a rough-hewn product of Harlem, a chronic truant and an eighth-grade dropout.         She had grown up far removed from the two genteel worlds of tennis: the white country club set and the network of black doctors, lawyers and other professionals who pursued tennis on private courts of their own.         Gibson owed much of her success to that very network of black tennis enthusiasts and to a geographic coincidence.         Althea Gibson, born in a sharecropper's shack in Silver, S.C., on Aug. 25, 1927, was brought to New York by her parents when she was a few months old. By chance, the family moved into an apartment on a West 143rd Street block between Lenox and Seventh Avenues that was a designated play street.         When the volunteers from the Police Athletic League closed the block to traffic and set up their recreation equipment, the spot they chose to mark off as a paddle tennis court was right in front of the Gibsons' front stoop.         A natural athlete who excelled in virtually every sport she tried, Gibson took up paddle tennis at 9 and won a citywide championship when she was 12.         In 1941 Buddy Walker, a Harlem bandleader and part-time P.A.L. supervisor, bought her two rackets and introduced her to friends at the Cosmopolitan Tennis Club, a predominantly black club that played on courts on 149th Street just a few blocks away but a world removed from the neighborhood she had known. Gibson was coached there by Fred Johnson, the one-armed club pro, and taken up by the club's members, who taught her some more important lessons.         As she put it in her 1958 autobiography, ''I Always Wanted to Be Somebody,'' the club attracted ''the highest class'' of Harlem residents, people, she noted, who ''had rigid ideas about what was socially acceptable.''         Those ideas were alien to her own experience.         ''I'm ashamed to say,'' she wrote, ''that I was still living pretty wild.''         Gibson would come home late (sometimes the next day) and her father, a garage attendant, would beat her. But Gibson saw her father as merely a stern disciplinarian, not abusive.         Gibson made a lifelong friendship when she approached her idol, the boxing champion Sugar Ray Robinson, in a bowling alley. Sympathetic to her dream of a career in music, he bought her a saxophone.         Finally, to escape her father's wrath, she sought refuge in a Catholic home for girls and eventually received a welfare grant to get her own apartment while she worked at menial jobs.         But it was tennis that gripped her interest. In 1942 she won her first tournament, the New York State girls' championship, sponsored by the American Tennis Association, which had been organized in 1916 by black players as an alternative to the United States Lawn Tennis Association.         In 1946, when she lost in the final of her first A.T.A. women's championship, she caught the eye of two men who changed her life and altered the course of tennis, Hubert A. Eaton of Wilmington, N.C., and R. Walter Johnson of Lynchburg, Va.         These men, both physicians and leaders of a cadre of black enthusiasts determined to crack the racial barriers of mainstream tennis, saw Gibson's potential and became her sponsors.         They arranged for Gibson to live with Eaton and his wife during the school year, practicing on his court and attending high school, and to spend the summer traveling on the A.T.A. circuit with Johnson, who later performed a similar service for Arthur Ashe.         She was 19 when she started at Wilmington Industrial High School, but finished in three years, graduating 10th in her class, and enrolled as a scholarship student at Florida A&M, receiving a degree at 25.         She also flourished on the court, winning the first of her 10 straight A.T.A. national championships in 1947.         In 1949, a year after Dr. Benjamin Weir had become the first black to play in a United States Lawn Tennis Association title event -- the 1948 National Indoor Championships -- Gibson took her first steps beyond the world of the black tennis circuit, making it to the semifinals of the Eastern Indoor Championships and then to the semifinals of the national championships.         The next step proved harder. Even after she had won the 1950 Eastern Indoor Championship and a clamor had begun to let her play in the National Grass Court Championships at Forest Hills, the precursor of the United States Open, the powers of tennis seemed to close ranks to keep her out.         To qualify for an invitation to the 1950 nationals, she was required to first make a name for herself at one of the major preliminary grass-court events. But no invitations were forthcoming.         Alice Marble, a former champion, rallied support for Gibson. ''If tennis is a game for ladies and gentlemen,'' she wrote in a letter to American Lawn Tennis magazine, ''it's time we acted a little more like gentlepeople and less like sanctimonious hypocrites.''         Finally, Gibson received an invitation to the Eastern Grass Court Championships at the Orange Lawn Tennis Club in South Orange, N.J. She made it only as far as the second round, but that was enough to win a bid to Forest Hills.         On Aug. 28, 1950, three years after Jackie Robinson had broken the color barrier in major league baseball, Gibson became the first black player to compete in the national tennis championship. Taking her place on a remote court at the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, Queens, she dispatched Barbara Knapp of England, 6-2, 6-2.         The next day, she faced the Wimbledon champion, Louise Brough. After losing the first set, 6-1, Gibson took the second, 6-3, then fell behind by 3-0 in the third before beginning a surge that brought repeated roars from 2,000 hardy spectators who ignored the first peals of thunder and flashes of lightning of a gathering storm.         Gibson took a lead of 7-6 and was on the verge of victory over her visibly spent opponent. But the rains came, the match was suspended, and when it resumed the next day, Brough won three straight games to win the match.         The 5-foot-10 1/2 Gibson gained the attention of the tennis public. A powerful if inconsistent player, the lean and muscular young woman had a dominating serve, and her long, graceful reach often stunned opponents.         Over the next half-dozen years, Gibson became a fixture on the tennis circuit, playing Wimbledon for the first time in 1951 and earning a ranking as high as No. 7 in the United States.         But Gibson became so disenchanted with her failure to break through to the top that she considered abandoning tennis and entering the Army.         In the fall of 1955, the State Department selected her for a goodwill tennis tour of Asia and the Far East, and the experience inspired her game. In 1956 she won 16 of her first 18 tournaments, including the French championship at Roland Garros, her first title at a Grand Slam event.         But once again victory in the singles championships eluded her at Wimbledon and Forest Hills, although she had been favored to win both. Gibson did team with Angela Buxton to win the Wimbledon doubles in 1956. She won in doubles again in 1957, with Darlene Hard, and in 1958, with Maria Bueno.         After losing to Shirley Fry of the United States in the singles final of the Australian Open in 1957, she did not lose another match all year. Passing up the clay court distraction of the French championship to concentrate on tuning up on grass courts in England, she again entered Wimbledon as the favorite and defeated Hard in the final.         ''At last,'' she said, ''at last,'' as she accepted the trophy from Queen Elizabeth II.         She later wrote in her autobiography: ''Shaking hands with the Queen of England was a long way from being forced to sit in the colored section of the bus going into downtown Wilmington, N.C.''         Upon returning home, Gibson was given a ticker-tape parade up Broadway, a banquet at the Waldorf-Astoria and a celebration on West 143rd Street.         She told friends and supporters, ''This victory belongs to you,'' but she chaffed at efforts to make her a symbol of black achievement.         When a reporter asked if she was proud to be compared to Jackie Robinson as an outstanding representative of her race, Gibson replied: ''No. I don't consider myself to be a representative of my people. I am thinking of me and nobody else.''         Having won Wimbledon, Gibson rolled through the national championship at Forest Hills. In the final, she defeated Brough, who had eliminated her in her first national seven years before.         After being named the outstanding female athlete of the year in a poll of Associated Press sports editors, Gibson repeated her Wimbledon and Forest Hills singles victories in 1958, and was named the outstanding female athlete again. Then, under pressure from her family to make some money from her talent, she announced her retirement from amateur tennis.         At a time when the professional game was little more than a sideshow, she had little trouble winning the pro title and went on an exhibition tour with the Harlem Globetrotters, playing tennis at halftime.         In the early 1960's she became the first black player to compete on the women's golf tour, but she never won a tournament. Gibson, who was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame at Newport, R.I., later held various athletic posts in New Jersey state government. A resident of East Orange, she had served as its recreation director.         Gibson was married twice, to William Darben and Sidney Llewellyn. She had no children.         When another black woman, Zina Garrison, made it to the Wimbledon final in 1990 before losing to Martina Navratilova, Gibson was there to cheer her on, but she soon receded from the limelight once again with health and financial problems.         ''It was truly an inspiration for me to watch her overcome adversity,'' Billie Jean King, who was 13 when she first say Gibson play, told The Associated Press yesterday. ''Her road to success was a challenging one, but I never saw her back down.''         Robert McG. Thomas Jr., a reporter for The New York Times, died in 2000.         Correction:  October 2, 2003, Thursday  An obituary on Monday about Althea Gibson, the first black competitor in the United State tennis nationals and the winner of five Grand Slam titles, gave an incorrect surname for the first black player in a United States Lawn Tennis Association title event. He was Dr. Reginald Weir, not Benjamin.       
         Marie Foster, a dental technician whose quiet but effective efforts to win voting rights for blacks made her a national symbol when she was beaten by the police in the Selma, Ala., voting rights march in 1965, died on Saturday in Selma. She was 85.         She was one of the original eight members of the Dallas County Voters League, a group that came to be called the Courageous Eight and worked with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights leaders to make Selma the center of a national crusade. She was later called ''the mother of the voting rights movement'' by its local organizers.         She tried eight times to register to vote before succeeding; she had already started coaching blacks on how to pass the deliberately bewildering voter registration tests.         She was clubbed at the foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge when state troopers stopped the first march from Selma to Montgomery on March 7. Two days later, she tried to hobble forward in another march, one that was stopped peacefully.         On March 11, when President Lyndon B. Johnson went on national television to announce that he would send Congress a strong voting rights bill, it was in Mrs. Foster's living room that Dr. King watched and wept at the news.         When the march was finally permitted to begin on March 21, two weeks later, Mrs. Foster walked 50 miles in five days with injured knees.         In his book on the civil rights movement, ''The Children'' (Random House, 1998), David Halberstam called Mrs. Foster ''one of the heroes of the Selma group.''         Marie Priscilla Martin was born on Oct. 24, 1917, in rural Wilcox County, near Alberta, Ala. Her mother wanted her children to be educated, but her father resisted moving to town, Mrs. Foster said in a statement prepared for the Web site of the National Voting Rights Museum and Institute in Selma, which she helped found. Her mother then sneaked away and took her children to Selma.         Mrs. Foster dropped out of high school to marry and had three young children when her husband died. After working for years, she returned to high school and graduated after her daughter, Rose. She then went to junior college, became a dental hygienist and went to work for her brother, Dr. Sullivan Jackson.         She became involved in the growing voting rights movement because of anger over racial discrimination. Mr. Halberstam suggested that being employed by her brother protected her from economic pressure from the white establishment.         Working with the Dallas County Voters League, she went door to door with leaflets and asked all ministers in town to announce the registration effort from their pulpits.         Things at first went slowly. Taylor Branch, in his book ''Pillar of Fire: America in the King Years 1963-65'' (Simon & Schuster, 1998), said her first nighttime class to teach literacy for the voting test drew one student, a man in his 70's.         In 1964, she was named in an injunction against voter registration leaders along with John Lewis, the civil rights leader who is now a Georgia congressman, Mr. Branch wrote. The Ku Klux Klan threatened her life several times.         In 1985, Mrs. Foster told about her experience at the bridge in an interview with United Press International.         ''It was a trooper who hit me,'' she said, adding that it happened just as she crossed the bridge near the head of the column of about 525 demonstrators. ''I lay on the pavement with my eyes closed. I didn't move. I stood my ground.''         Mrs. Foster is survived by her son, James Foster of Indianapolis; her daughter, Rose Davis of Salt Lake City; her brothers, Dr. Sullivan Jackson and Thomas Martin, both of Selma; and three grandchildren.         Her activism never stopped, said Rose Sanders, a friend and civil rights lawyer. Among more recent battles, Mrs. Foster was a leader in successful fights for public housing for poor people in Selma and the removal of a statue of the founder of the Klan from a public park.         She conducted reading classes for underprivileged children in a small classroom next to her home, and made it a point to take poor children to Sunday school.         ''She never quit,'' Ms. Sanders said.       
         Madame Chiang Kai-shek, a pivotal figure in one of the 20th century's great epics -- the struggle for control of post-imperial China waged between the Nationalists and the Communists during the Japanese invasion and the violent aftermath of World War II -- died on Thursday in Manhattan, the Foreign Ministry of Taiwan reported yesterday. She was 105.         Madame Chiang, a dazzling and imperious politician, wielded immense influence in Nationalist China, but she and her husband were eventually forced by the Communist victory into exile in Taiwan, where she presided as the grande dame of Nationalist politics for many years. After Chiang Kai-shek died in 1975, she retreated to New York City, where she spent the rest of her life.         But her old influence overseas was matched, and perhaps exceeded, by the relentless and sophisticated lobbying effort she and her husband set up in Washington, through which they distributed uncounted millions through law firms and public relations companies to promote Taiwan's cause and maintain recognition by the American government.         During the 1950's, Madame Chiang and her husband blamed the United States for the Nationalists' loss of China, and continued to campaign for help from Washington to retake the mainland. Although that hope eventually faded, American support for Taiwan remained strong for years, delaying Washington's recognition of Beijing as the capital of China until 1979, three decades after the Communists seized power.         As a fluent English speaker, as a Christian, as a model of what many Americans hoped China to become, Madame Chiang struck a chord with American audiences as she traveled across the country, starting in the 1930's, raising money and lobbying for support of her husband's government. She seemed to many Americans to be the very symbol of the modern, educated, pro-American China they yearned to see emerge -- even as many Chinese dismissed her as a corrupt, power-hungry symbol of the past they wanted to escape.         Ultimately, that difference in perspectives was perhaps one reason that she fled an increasingly democratic Taiwan, where many people reviled her and where she felt less at home as native Taiwanese eclipsed the exiled mainlanders.         Madame Chiang was the most famous member of one of modern China's most remarkable families, the Soongs, who dominated Chinese politics and finance in the first half of the 20th century. Yet in China it was her American background and style that distinguished Soong Mei-ling; that was her maiden name, sometimes spelled May-ling.         For many Americans, her finest moment came in 1943, when she barnstormed the United States in search of support for the Nationalist cause against Japan, winning donations from countless Americans who were mesmerized by her passion, determination and striking good looks. Her address to a joint meeting of Congress electrified Washington, winning billions of dollars in aid.         She helped create American policy toward China during the war years, running the Nationalist government's propaganda operation and emerging as its most important diplomat. Yet she was also deeply involved in the endless maneuverings of her husband, who was uneasily at the helm of several shifting alliances with Chinese warlords vying for control of what was then a badly fractured nation.         A devout Christian, Madame Chiang spoke fluent English tinted with the Southern accent she acquired as a schoolgirl in Georgia, and she presented a civilized and humane image of a courageous China battling Japanese invasion and Communist subversion. Yet historians have documented the murderous path that Chiang Kai-shek led in his efforts to win, then keep, and ultimately lose power. It also became clear in later years that the Chiang family had pocketed hundreds of millions of dollars of American aid intended for the war.         Madame Chiang had a notoriously tempestuous relationship with her husband, and then with his son by a previous marriage, Chiang Ching-kuo, who became Taiwan's leader after Chiang Kai-shek's death. She had no children.         Her skill as a politician, alternately charming and vicious, made her a formidable presence. She made a play for Taiwan's leadership after Chiang Ching-kuo died in 1988, even though she was 90 and living in New York.         Although she suffered numerous ailments, including breast cancer, she outlived all her contemporary rivals. She was said to credit her religious faith -- she told friends she rose at dawn for an hour of prayer each day -- for her good health.         Gen. Joseph W. Stilwell, who worked closely with her when he commanded American forces in China during the war, described Madame Chiang in his diary as a ''clever, brainy woman.''         ''Direct, forceful, energetic,'' he wrote. ''Loves power, eats up publicity and flattery, pretty weak on her history. Can turn on charm at will and knows it.''         Soong Mei-ling's rise to power began when she married Chiang in an opulent ceremony in Shanghai in 1927, bringing together China's star military man with one of the nation's most illustrious families.         Her eldest sister, Soong Ai-ling, directed the family's affairs and innumerable money-making ventures with the help of her husband, H. H. Kung, a scion of one of China's wealthiest banking families.         Madame Chiang's second sister, Soong Qing-ling, was the wife of Sun Yat-sen, China's first president after the last emperor was toppled in 1911. After Sun's death, Soong Qing-ling carried his banner over into the Communist camp, causing an irreparable rupture in the family.         When the vanquished Nationalists retreated to Taiwan in 1949, Soong Qing-ling stayed behind. The Communist Party leadership called her the only true patriot in the Soong family, and appointed her honorary chairman of the People's Republic in 1980, a year before her death.         A Telling Ditty         Today, Chinese still remember the three sisters with a telling ditty: ''One loved money, one loved power, one loved China,'' referring respectively to Ai-ling, Mei-ling and Qing-ling.         Madame Chiang's elder brother, T. V. Soong, often called Nationalist China's financial wizard, served at various times as finance minister, acting prime minister and foreign minister, where his primary role was raising money from America.         Although Madame Chiang developed a stellar image with the American public, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and other leaders became disillusioned with her and her husband's despotic and corrupt practices. Eleanor Roosevelt was shocked at her answer when asked at a dinner at the White House how the Chinese government would handle a strike by coal miners. Madame Chiang silently drew a sharp fingernail across her neck.         ''She can talk beautifully about democracy,'' Mrs. Roosevelt said later. ''But she does not know how to live democracy.''         By the end of the war, the loyalty of Nationalist officials melted away as the government grew corrupt and fiscally traitorous, printing money so aggressively that the Chinese currency fell to an exchange rate of several million yuan to the dollar. Many Nationalist soldiers were reduced to begging for food because they went unpaid, yet American diplomats discovered that military supplies sent from the United States to China sometimes appeared on the black market soon after arrival.         During the 1950's, Madame Chiang and her husband continued to campaign for help from Washington to retake the mainland, although That hope eventually faded.         In New York, Madame Chiang lived in an apartment on Gracie Square in Manhattan. In March 1999, as she turned 101, hard of hearing but still quick-witted, she told visitors that she read the Bible and The New York Times every day.         The Soong family's saga, cutting across many strands of modern Chinese history, began when Madame Chiang's father, Charlie Soong, sailed to the United States at the age of 12. Coming from a family of traders in Hainan Island in the South China Sea, Mr. Soong was taken in by Methodists in North Carolina who converted him to Christianity in hopes of sending him back to spread the word of Jesus in China.         After returning to Shanghai in 1886, Mr. Soong, a genial wheeler-dealer, passed up missionary life to start a business printing Bibles, earning a fortune. He also printed political pamphlets secretly for Sun Yat-sen, then working to overthrow China's last emperor. On Jan. 1, 1912, Sun became China's first president.         Sun lasted in office only a few months before his coalition disintegrated, and after he fled to Japan, he hired Mr. Soong's second daughter, Soong Qing-ling, as a secretary. They soon married, despite the age difference: he was 50 and she was 21.         Educated in America         Mei-ling Soong was born in Shanghai on March 5, 1898, although some references give 1897 as the year because Chinese usually consider everyone to be one year old at birth. At the age of 10, she had followed her elder sisters to the Wesleyan College for Women in Macon, Ga.         She entered Wellesley College near Boston in 1913; her brother, T. V., was enrolled at Harvard. She majored in English literature, and was remembered by her classmates as a chubby, vivacious and determined student. She graduated in 1917 and returned to Shanghai speaking English better than Chinese.         She was introduced to her future husband in 1922. By that time, she had matured into a slender beauty and taken to wearing full-length, body-hugging gowns.         Chiang Kai-shek, a severe-looking military aide to Sun who established a school for officers in southern China, may have been as attracted to the Soongs' financial and political connections as he was to their youngest daughter. His initial overtures to her were rebuffed, and after Sun's death in 1925, as Chiang took the title generalissimo and tried to succeed him as the leader of the Nationalist cause, he proposed to Sun's young widow, Soong Qing-ling. She said no.         Chiang allied himself with warlords in southern and central China and with the Soviet Union, where Stalin regarded the Nationalists as more progressive than the warlords who still controlled Beijing and northern China. Communist rebels, not yet led by Mao Zedong, felt they deserved Moscow's support. But Stalin insisted on supporting the Nationalists.         In 1927, Chiang shocked his Soviet backers by carrying out a massacre of leftists in Shanghai. Edgar Snow, the American journalist, estimated that Chiang's forces had executed more than 5,000 people.         The massacre caused a permanent rent in the Soong family. Soong Qing-ling, as Sun's widow, led a faction of Nationalists who voted to expel Chiang from all his posts. T. V. Soong resigned as finance minister, though he was later persuaded to resume his alliance with Chiang.         When Chiang renewed his interest in Soong Mei-ling in 1927, she told him that she would consent to marry only if he could win the approval of her mother, who had reservations about a man who was neither Christian nor single. Chiang had already fathered a son in a marriage that was arranged when he was only 14, and had adopted a second son and married a second wife, Chen Chieh-ru. Chiang promised to convert, and eventually sent Chen away to the United States, where she enrolled at Columbia University and earned a doctorate.         The Chiang-Soong wedding took place in Shanghai on Dec. 1, 1927. A small Christian ceremony was held at the Soong mansion on Seymour Road, followed by a political ceremony at the Majestic Hotel, beneath a portrait of Sun.         As a political partner to her husband, Madame Chiang developed what she called the New Life Movement, a series of principles for modernizing China through social discipline, courtesy and service. She engineered public hygiene campaigns and denounced traditional superstitions.         While many ordinary Chinese resisted it, the campaign was popular with foreigners, particularly with Henry Luce, the publisher of Time magazine, who was born to missionaries in China. A longtime supporter of the Chiangs, Luce named the couple ''Man and Woman of the Year'' in 1938.         During the war with the Japanese, Madame Chiang pushed her husband to build up the Nationalist air force, and helped hire Claire Chennault, who commanded a mercenary force of pilots that came to be known as the Flying Tigers.         During World War II, the relationship between General Stilwell, Chiang and Madame Chiang proved contentious. The general accused Chiang of hoarding resources, deliberately avoiding battle with the Japanese to spare his men to fight the Communists.         Madame Chiang was in the middle, sometimes interceding on General Stilwell's behalf when resisting him threatened American support. But she also plotted against the general, telling journalists that he was incompetent. She and her husband lobbied Washington to have him replaced, and he was, in 1944.         After Japan was defeated in 1945 and the civil war between Nationalists and Communists accelerated, the Communists swiftly expanded their control into the northeast.         The governing Nationalists received considerable American aid, but American officials in China warned of vast amounts of graft among Nationalists. More than $3 billion was appropriated to China during the war, and most of it was transmitted through T. V. Soong, who as China's foreign minister was based in Washington. It later became apparent that the Soong family suffered vicious infighting over the purloined funds.         Madame Chiang traveled to Washington again in November 1948 to plead for emergency aid for the war against the Communists. Yet Congress had recently assigned $1 billion more to China, and President Truman was impatient with the Chiangs and what had become an apparently hopeless effort to shore up the Nationalist government. Madame Chiang never returned to China.         ''I can ask the American people for nothing more,'' she said. ''It is either in your hearts to love us, or your hearts have been turned from us.''         In her frustration, she publicly likened American politics to ''clodhopping boorishness.'' Coming after years of generous American support, that irritated Truman.         ''They're thieves, every damn one of them,'' Truman said later, referring to Nationalist leaders. ''They stole $750 million out of the billions that we sent to Chiang. They stole it, and it's invested in real estate down in São Paolo and some right here in New York.''         General Chiang resigned as president of Nationalist China in January 1949 and fled to Taiwan that May, taking with him a national art collection that was kept in crates in Taiwan for years as the Chiangs clung to the ever-diminishing hope that they would some day take it back to Beijing.         Over the years, Madame Chiang's health wavered, and in 1976 she was diagnosed with breast cancer and had a mastectomy, and later, a second one.         Her Final Years         Even after she moved to permanent residence in New York, she kept her finger on the pulse of Nationalist politics. She returned to Taiwan after her stepson died in January 1988. Even though she was nearly 90, she tried to rally her old allies. But Lee Teng-hui, chosen as vice president both because he was Taiwan-born and because he was considered a pushover by fellow Nationalists, proved more adept at politics than expected, and he gradually solidified his control.         Madame Chiang lived out her final years in New York, with a pack of black-suited bodyguards who cleared the lobby of her Gracie Square apartment building every time she entered or left. She returned to Congress for one last appearance in 1995.         Until this year, Madame Chiang maintained an annual tradition of receiving a few friends at her Manhattan apartment on her birthday. But this year, she came down with pneumonia, and was was unable to do that, the local Chinese press reported.         Her last public appearance was believed to be in January 2000, when she attended an exhibition of her watercolor paintings of traditional Chinese landscapes at the Queens headquarters of the World Journal, a prominent local Chinese newspaper. She was in a wheelchair, but was reported to be in good spirits, telling people there that she was very happy that day.         Correction:  November 17, 2003, Monday  An obituary of Mme. Chiang Kai-shek on Oct. 25 and in some late editions on Oct. 24 referred imprecisely to her attempt to influence political control in Taiwan in 1988, after the death of her stepson, Chiang Ching-kuo, who had been president as well as chairman of the ruling Nationalist Party. Mme. Chiang tried unsuccessfully to block his successor as president, Lee Teng-hui, from succeeding him as chairman; she did not seek office for herself, nor was she eligible to do so.       
         Carolyn G. Heilbrun, a retired Columbia University literary scholar whose extensive writings included pioneering books and essays in the feminist canon and a dozen highly erudite detective novels under the pseudonym Amanda Cross, died at her home in Manhattan on Thursday. She was 77.         Professor Heilbrun, who had written of taking her own life in a 1997 book, ''The Last Gift of Time: Life Beyond Sixty,'' committed suicide, said her son, Robert. She had not been ill, he noted yesterday. ''She wanted to control her destiny,'' he said, ''and she felt her life was a journey that had concluded.''         Aside from serving as an instructor at Brooklyn College in 1959-60 and as a visiting lecturer or professor at Yale, Princeton, Swarthmore and other colleges, Ms. Heilbrun spent her entire academic career at Columbia, joining the faculty in 1960 as an instructor of English and comparative literature and retiring in 1992 as the Avalon Foundation Professor in the Humanities.         But she was best known as the author of nine scholarly books, including ''Toward a Recognition of Androgyny,'' ''Reinventing Womanhood'' and ''Writing a Woman's Life,'' and scores of articles that interpreted women's literature from a feminist perspective, and as the author of the Kate Fansler mysteries. Her heroine, like her creator, was a professor of literature and a feminist.         The novels were ostensibly murder mysteries whose amateur sleuth sometimes sought clues in literary texts and a killer's motives in academic politics. Most were well received by readers, but some critics said the plots were thin and the social commentary thick, and that the real subjects were women's changing social positions, relationships with one another and struggle for independence.         The books offered scathing depictions of academic backbiting, observations on Ivy League social pretensions and thinly veiled, unflattering portraits of Columbia colleagues, including one professor who seemed to have been modeled after the writer Lionel Trilling.         Some critics complained that satiric wit and clever talk filled half a book before the victim fell dead, and that some of it sounded like an imitation of Oscar Wilde or George Bernard Shaw. But devotees said it was all good fun, and some compared her work to the cerebral puzzles of Dorothy L. Sayers.         Fearing that her mystery writing might be seen by colleagues as frivolous and might even jeopardize her chances for tenure, Ms. Heilbrun concealed the identity of Amanda Cross for six years. In 1964 her first novel, ''In the Last Analysis,'' was nominated for an Edgar Award by the Mystery Writers of America. ''Winning would have blown my cover,'' she recalled.         But after the 1970 publication of ''Poetic Justice,'' with its recognizable depiction of Columbia University's atmosphere after the student revolt of the late 1960's, Ms. Heilbrun's friends began to guess that she might be Amanda Cross, the author of three novels, including ''The James Joyce Murder.'' Later novels included ''Death in a Tenured Position,'' ''No Word from Winifred'' and ''The Puzzled Heart.''         Carolyn Gold Heilbrun was born on Jan. 13, 1926, in East Orange, N.J., the only child of Archibald Gold, an accountant, and Estelle Roemer Gold, who, her daughter would recall, ''sat at home and was bored out of her mind.'' The family moved to Manhattan when Ms. Heilbrun was 6, and she became a voracious reader, devouring Nancy Drew and Judy Bolton mysteries and, as a teenager, the novels of Virginia Woolf and Willa Cather.         She graduated from private schools in New York and from Wellesley College in 1947 with a bachelor's degree in English. She was married in 1945 to James Heilbrun, a Harvard student who became a professor of economics at Fordham University. In addition to her son, of Brooklyn, and her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Margaret Heilbrun, of Brooklyn, and Emily Heilbrun, of Eugene, Ore., and two grandchildren.         Enrolling in graduate school at Columbia, Ms. Heilbrun received a master's degree in 1951 and a doctorate in 1959. Her first notable essay was ''The Character of Hamlet's Mother,'' a 1957 article in Shakespeare Quarterly. It portrayed Gertrude as clever, not shallow, lucid rather than silly: ideas that were forerunners of feminism at the time, but hardly startling when the essay was reprinted in 1990 as part of ''Hamlet's Mother and Other Women.''         On the Columbia faculty, Ms. Heilbrun rose through the ranks: assistant professor in 1962, associate professor in 1967, full professor with tenure in 1972, Avalon Professor in 1985. In 1986 she became the first director of the university's Institute for Research on Women and Gender, which promotes feminist scholarship.         Her academic specialty was British modern literature, roughly from 1890 to 1950, an era that included Yeats, Conrad and Eliot, with a particular focus on the Bloomsbury group, made up of Virginia Woolf, Lytton Strachey, E. M. Forster and other writers.         Although she was widely respected by feminist scholars, she complained when she retired that she was isolated by her male colleagues at Columbia. ''When I spoke up for women's issues, I was made to feel unwelcome in my own department, kept off crucial committees, ridiculed, ignored,'' she told Anne Matthews in an interview for a New York Times Magazine article in 1992.         Throughout her academic career, and afterward, Ms. Heilbrun continued to write books and contribute articles to professional journals, newspapers and magazines. She wrote numerous book reviews and essays for Hers, a former column in The Times.         Her 1973 book, ''Toward a Recognition of Androgyny: Aspects of Male and Female in Literature,'' brought her to prominence in the academic feminist movement. Rejecting traditional ideas of male and female and using examples from Greek literature, the Bible and other writings, she urged women to escape from what she called the prison of gender.         Ms. Heilbrun drew on her long interest in biography and autobiography for her 1988 book, ''Writing a Woman's Life,'' her first best seller, which focused on women writing about themselves and other women. Even accomplished women, like Virginia Woolf and Eudora Welty, tended to judge themselves on how well they fulfilled traditional expectations, she concluded.       
         Shirley P. Glass, a psychologist who strove to redefine the nature of infidelity, died on Oct. 8 at her home in Owings Mills, Md.. She was 67.         The cause was cancer, said Ira Glass, her son and the producer of ''This American Life'' on public radio stations.         In magazine articles, a recent book and interviews on ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'' and other television programs, Dr. Glass examined how the emotional intimacy of the workplace and the Internet had led even people in successful marriages to slip into emotionally intense relationships that could easily lead to affairs.         Dr. Glass said that even if these intense relationships did not lead to sex they were a threat to marriages and part of what she termed ''the new crisis of infidelity.'' The reason, she said, is that the emotional intimacy with the friend gradually, almost invisibly, supplants that with the spouse. Still, some critics questioned the utility of changing the traditional definition of infidelity.         Dr. Glass also made an impact among marriage therapists by saying that betrayed partners in adulterous affairs often suffered from post-traumatic stress similar to that experienced by combat veterans.         She advocated a new means of dealing with the aftermath of an affair: absolute honesty about every detail, down to sexual details if the wronged partner wanted to know them.         But based on wide surveys of other therapists, Dr. Glass found that it was most common to exclude the extramarital affair from the therapeutic discussion. She described this as ''waxing a dirty floor.''         Dr. John Gottman, a therapist and author who is executive director of the Relationship Institute in Seattle, said, ''This insight is threatening to everybody,'' but added that it was ''potentially very healing.''         He said that Dr. Glass's achievement lay in taking the moral component out of discussions of infidelity and treating it as an everyday, if exceedingly difficult, problem.         But it is a different kind of problem than commonly assumed, Dr. Glass argued. One of her findings, based on her clinical research in Baltimore, was that the majority of men who have affairs characterized their marriages, including their sex life, as ''happy'' or ''very happy.''         At the time of her death, Dr. Glass was beginning a more academic study to follow up her first book, ''Not 'Just Friends' '' (Free Press, 2003).         Shirley Bernice Politzer was born on March 1, 1936, in Richmond, Va. Her father ran a hardware store, and she grew up in the Pimlico section of Baltimore. She graduated from high school at 16 and from an honors course at the University of Maryland in three years.         She met Barry Glass, an accountant who became her husband of 48 years, at a swimming pool when she was 15. They married when she was 19.         In addition to her husband and her son, Ira, of Chicago, Dr. Glass is survived by two daughters, Randi Murray of Hillsborough, Calif., and Karen Glass Berry of Los Angeles, and two grandsons.         Dr. Glass taught high school math while earning a master's degree in psychology from Towson State University. Later, she was a psychologist in the Baltimore public school system. She became interested in the subject of infidelity after learning about a friend who was having an affair, and she pursued the subject in a doctoral program at Catholic University, where she earned her Ph.D. in 1980.         Mr. Glass said recently that he and his wife respected each other too much to have had an affair.         ''We were always the best of friends,'' he said.       
         Louise Day Hicks, the Boston public school official and City Council member whose opposition to busing to achieve school integration helped to polarize the city in the 1960's and made her a national symbol of racial division, died on Tuesday at her home in South Boston. She was 87.         Mrs. Hicks was the city's most prominent opponent of busing, saying it was not what parents, especially those in her almost-all-white South Boston neighborhood, wanted. To her supporters, she was a champion of working-class residents and neighborhood schools. To her opponents, she epitomized an unwillingness to breach a deep-seated racial divide in deeply segregated Boston.         ''She became the symbol, if you please, of someone who was against desegregating Boston schools,'' said Paul Parks, who was chairman of the education committee of the Boston N.A.A.C.P. in the 1960's, a former state secretary of education and a former president of the Boston School Committee. ''She would not admit segregation exists.''         Mrs. Hicks, a lawyer and the daughter of a prominent South Boston judge, spent a decade fighting against forced integration in Boston before it was ordered in 1974 by Judge W. Arthur Garrity Jr. of Federal District Court.         Mrs. Hicks was elected to the Boston School Committee in 1961. Two years later, the local N.A.A.C.P. chapter declared that ''de facto segregation'' existed in the schools, citing a report that 13 schools were more than 90 percent black and significantly lacking in money. Mrs. Hicks, then the chairwoman, cast aside the issue when it was brought before the committee, asking that the board ''kindly proceed to educational matters.'' She was overwhelmingly re-elected that fall and immediately became a lightning rod for the issue.         In 1965, when Massachusetts enacted a law ordering districts to desegregate or lose state financing, Mrs. Hicks refused to back down. She said she felt that the Boston schools were being made a scapegoat by suburban legislators who wanted nothing more than to meddle in neighborhoods they knew nothing about. ''If the suburbs are so interested in solving the problems of the Negro,'' she said, ''why don't they build subsidized housing for them?''         Mrs. Hicks, the subject of numerous death threats, insisted she was not racist.         She refused to meet with Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama, an ardent segregationist, telling a reporter that she did not want to be connected with him. ''The important thing is that I'm not bigoted,'' she once said.         Mrs. Hicks always insisted that she had the best interests of students in mind with her anti-busing crusade.         ''I have guarded your children well,'' she said in announcing her mayoral candidacy in 1967. ''I will continue to defend the neighborhood school as long as I have a breath left in my body.''         She did not focus on busing during the campaign, sidestepping the issue with the slogan ''You know where I stand.''         Despite a victory in the September primary, she lost the election by 12,000 votes to Kevin H. White, another first-time mayoral candidate of Irish descent who snatched up last-minute votes in the black neighborhoods of Roxbury and Mattapan.         Mrs. Hicks won election to the City Council by a landslide in 1969. In 1970 she won a race to fill a vacant seat in the House of Representatives, but was defeated in 1972. She was re-elected to the City Council in 1973 and 1975 and lost in 1977 and 1981, but filled a vacant seat for one year, 1979. Plagued by poor health, she then left local politics.         ''I think she was exemplary in her willingness to come to her own conclusions and really very bravely act on her convictions,'' said William M. Bulger, a former president of the State Senate and the University of Massachusetts and a native of South Boston. ''It's not true of everyone. In fact, there's a great deal of poll-taking at all times these days, but Mrs. Hicks had to recognize that she was taking a position during that time at odds with what the opinion molders certainly felt.''         Louise Day was born in South Boston on Oct. 16, 1916, although many who worked with her said she often lied about her age. She was the only daughter of William J. and Anna McCarron Day. Her mother died when Mrs. Hicks was 14, and she was especially close to her father, a lawyer, judge and businessman, whom she cited as her inspiration to become a lawyer. She graduated from Wheelock Teacher's College in Boston in 1938 and received an education degree from Boston University in 1952 and a law degree from there in 1955.         She married John Hicks, an engineer, in 1942. He died of cancer in 1968. She is survived by a son, William. Another son, John, vanished in 1978.       
         Gertrude Ederle, who was called ''America's best girl'' by President Calvin Coolidge in 1926 after she became the first woman to swim across the English Channel, died yesterday at a nursing home in Wyckoff, N.J. She was 98.         Ederle was a symbol of the Roaring 20's, a decade given as much to heroics as to materialism. For a time, her accomplishment put her in the public's affection at the level of Babe Ruth, Jack Dempsey, Bill Tilden and Red Grange.         Ederle did not sustain the lofty place in history of another hero of the 1920's, Charles A. Lindbergh, who crossed the Atlantic a year after her historic swim, or of the golden athletes who appeared regularly before the public and kept their fame alive. But her feat, which she did only once and under horrendous conditions, made a memorable contribution in an age when many found it difficult to take female athletes seriously.         They had to take Ederle seriously, because she beat the records of the five men who had previously made the swim from 1875 to 1923.         Years later, after other men and women had successfully swum the Channel, Grover A. Whalen, New York City's official greeter, said that of all the celebrities he had welcomed to town, he could not recall one that made the impact of Ederle at her homecoming.         Ederele was born Oct. 23, 1905, in New York City, one of four daughters and two sons of Henry Ederle, a butcher and provisioner, and his wife, Anna. Her father owned a summer cottage in Highlands, N.J., and she learned to swim on the Jersey Shore.         She called herself a ''water baby'' and said that over the years, she was ''happiest between the waves.'' But she developed a hearing problem when she was 5, after a bout with the measles. ''The doctors told me my hearing would get worse if I continued swimming, but I loved the water so much, I just couldn't stop,'' she said.         In the early 1920's, as a competitive swimmer, she set women's world freestyle records and American freestyle records for various distances from 100 to 800 meters. In a single afternoon in 1922, she broke seven such records at Brighton Beach, Brooklyn. Between 1921 and 1925, she held 29 amateur national and world records.         In what might have been an anticipation of her Channel swim, she swam more than 16 miles through tricky currents between the Battery and Sandy Hook, N.J.         In 1924, she was a member of the United States team that competed in the Olympics in Paris. She won a gold medal as part of the 400-meter freestyle relay, and she won the bronze medal in the 100 and 400 individual freestyle events. It was no small accomplishment. She was swimming with an injured knee and, together with the other female athletes from the United States, she had an added handicap of fatigue. They were put up in hotels far away from the center of Paris because United States officials did not want them contaminated with what they saw as the city's bohemian morality. Ederle and her teammates had to travel five to six hours each day to practice in the Olympic pool.         After Paris, she began to focus on the English Channel. The first person to swim it was Matthew Webb of England, who in 1875 made it in 21 hours 45 minutes. Of the four other men who succeeded before Ederle, none were faster than 16 hours 33 minutes. One swimmer, Henry Sullivan of the United States, required 26 hours 50 minutes.         Ederle first tried to swim the Channel in 1925. The Women's Swimming Association provided the financial backing. But after she swam 23 miles in 8 hours 43 minutes, the people in a boat who were supposed to look after her thought she might be unconscious in the water. Somebody yelled, ''She's drowning!'' and they touched her, which immediately disqualified her.         A perturbed Ederle insisted that she had not been drowning at all, only resting, and that she could have easily continued. ''All I could wonder was, 'What will they think of me back in the States?' '' she said. She vowed to try it again and told her father and everyone else involved that no matter how she looked in the water, she did not want to be touched.         She decided not to ask the Women's Swimming Association to back her a second time and raised the needed $9,000 herself. With the help of her sister Margaret, she designed a two-piece bathing suit that would not drag in the water, yet would be ''decent in case I failed and they had to drag me out,'' she said.         Shortly after 7 a.m. on Aug. 6, 1926, Ederle, smeared with sheep grease, waded into the English Channel at Cape Gris-Nez, France. She could see a red ball on the French shore, a warning to small craft to avoid a sea that promised to be very choppy. ''Please, God, help me,'' she said.         For a while, she said she sang ''Let Me Call You Sweetheart'' to the rhythm of her stroke. In the boat that moved with her, the crew occasionally held up signs, which said things like ''one wheel,'' ''two wheels,'' enumerating parts of a car, because she had been promised a red roadster if she was successful.         Fourteen hours 31 minutes later, a world record, Ederle reached Kingsdown on the English coast. If she had been able to swim in a straight line, it would have been a 21-mile trip. But the sea was so rough, she swam no less than 35 miles. Ederle always held that her record was never broken, even though in 1950, another American, Florence Chadwick, swam the Channel in 13 hours 20 minutes. That was in a relatively calm sea, Ederle said, so it was not a fair comparison.         She was not prepared for the ticker-tape parade that New York gave her through its financial district on Aug. 27, 1926, in which an estimated two million people turned out and chanted, ''Trudy! Trudy!'' even though her family had always called her ''Gertie.'' She had to be rushed into Mayor Jimmy Walker's office in City Hall when exuberant crowds stormed the doors. She was also not prepared for the adulation she received in the weeks to come, when somebody wrote a song titled, ''Tell Me, Trudy, Who Is Going to Be the Lucky One?'' Men were proposing to her by mail almost every week.         Coolidge invited her to the White House, called her ''America's best girl,'' and said to her, ''I am amazed that a woman of your small stature should be able to swim the English Channel.'' It was a curious observation; Ederle weighed 142 pounds and soon became an adviser to a manufacturer of dresses for large women.         She was invited to join a touring vaudeville act, and there were reports that she earned $2,000 or $3,000 a week. She went to Hollywood and made a 10-minute movie about herself, for which she was paid $8,000. Various groups wanted her to speak, and the marriage proposals kept coming.         ''I finally got the shakes,'' she told an interviewer years later. ''I was just a bundle of nerves. I had to quit the tour and I was stone deaf.'' The hearing problem she had since childhood was made much worse by the Channel swim. Ederle had what was later described as a nervous breakdown.         Her encroaching deafness made her shy away from people. In 1929, she was ''practically engaged'' to one man, and suggested to him that it might be difficult being married to a woman who could not hear well. He agreed and vanished. After he left her, she said: ''There never was anyone else. I just didn't want to get hurt again.''         As the years passed, the public made fewer demands on her. The proposals stopped.         In 1933, she slipped on broken tiles in the stairwell of the apartment building in which she lived, injured her back and was in a cast for four years. Doctors told her she would neither walk nor swim again, but in 1939 she appeared in Billy Rose's Aquacade at the New York World's Fair.         Over the years, it sometimes seemed that journalists alone remembered her, and they wrote articles commemorating the 5th, 10th, 15th, 20th and 25th anniversaries of her Channel swim. She always obliged with an interview but detested the articles that tried to make her pitiable. ''Don't weep for me, don't write any sob stories,'' she told The New York Times in 1956.         When World War II began, Ederle took a job working for an airline at La Guardia Airport. She checked flight instruments used by airplanes and loved the work, she said. She quit after the war, when told she could keep the job if she moved to Tulsa, Okla.         For many years, she taught swimming to children at the Lexington School for the Deaf in New York. She did not know sign language but was able to demonstrate to them in the water what they should know about swimming. Her own deafness continued to worsen.         Although she claimed she had saved and invested well, she never made the huge amounts of money that came to celebrities in later generations. She earned some money in the 1950's lending her name to a bacteria-free swimming pool, but her income over the years was modest.         Ederle lived for many years in Flushing, Queens, with two female companions.         She is survived by 10 nephews and nieces.         ''I have no complaints,'' Ederle told one interviewer. ''I am comfortable and satisfied. I am not a person who reaches for the moon as long as I have the stars.''       
         Dr. Gisela Konopka, a pioneer in the study of troubled adolescents who provided groundbreaking insights on disruptive behavior among girls, died on Dec. 9 in Minneapolis. She was 93.         The cause was pulmonary edema, said Dr. Robert Blum, a friend and colleague, who is a professor of pediatrics at the University of Minnesota. The Konopka Institute for Best Practices in Adolescent Health, named for Dr. Konopka, is at the university.         A retired professor of social work, Dr. Konopka was the author of several works, including ''The Adolescent Girl in Conflict.'' The book, published in 1966, was one of the first in-depth examinations of the lives of troubled teenage girls.         ''All my life, it seems, I have talked about how people can't be bad just because they're black, or Jewish or women,'' Dr. Konopka told The Minneapolis Star Tribune in an interview for an article published in 2000. ''Well, they can't be bad just because they're young.''         Judith Kahn, director of the Konopka Institute, said ''The Adolescent Girl in Conflict'' broke new ground in offering girls a chance to present their own perspectives.         ''No one before had really listened to troubled adolescents and to what they said they wanted and needed in their lives,'' Ms. Kahn said. ''It wasn't just a look at the data, it was a look at what was underneath the data.''         Born Gisela Peiper in Berlin, she joined the resistance movement after Hitler came to power and eventually fled Germany, arriving in the United States in 1941. She met her future husband, Paul, in Germany before her departure, and they married after he arrived in New York a short time later.         Dr. Konopka received a master's degree in social service administration from the University of Pittsburgh and joined the social work faculty at the University of Minnesota in 1947. She later received a doctorate in social welfare from Columbia.         She remained a professor at the University of Minnesota until her retirement in 1978. Her husband, Paul, an engineer at General Mills, died in 1976.         She is survived by a foster daughter, Patricia Dreyer, of Minnetonka, Minn.       
         Mary Jane Russell, a leading fashion model of the 1940's and '50's who was a favorite of the photographers Louise Dahl-Wolfe and Irving Penn, died on Nov. 20 in Charleston, S.C. She was 77.         The cause was pulmonary fibrosis, said her husband, Edward T. Russell.         Mrs. Russell began modeling in New York in 1948, at the height of the New Look, and worked for the Ford Agency for next 13 years, appearing on dozens of covers of Vogue and Harper's Bazaar. Though not as tall as other photographic models -- she was just 5-foot-6 -- Mrs. Russell possessed a long neck and classical features that suited the era's elegant mood.         ''She brought to her posing as a model concentration and tenderness, rare in the fashion medium today,'' said Mr. Penn, who used Mrs. Russell for his photograph ''Girl Drinking,'' which appeared in Vogue in 1949. Often photographed in profile, she also posed for Mr. Penn's well-known 1951 image ''Girl With Tobacco on Tongue,'' a sitting that required Mrs. Russell to flick a bit of cigarette tobacco off her tongue repeatedly, in a ladylike way, of course.         Dahl-Wolfe often requested Mrs. Russell, according to Irving Solero, the photographer of the museum of the Fashion Institute of Technology, which houses Dahl-Wolfe's color archive. ''Louise had so much power and because she and Carmel Snow, the editor of Harper's Bazaar, were close, Louise was able to get whom she wanted, and she asked for Mary Jane a lot,'' said Mr. Solero, who estimates that Mrs. Russell modeled for about 30 percent of Dahl-Wolfe's photos. She also worked for the photographers Richard Avedon and William Klein.         She was born Mary Jane Walton on July 10, 1926, in Teaneck, N.J., and graduated from Sarah Lawrence College. While she studied art, Mr. Russell, whom she had met at Teaneck High School, pursued her with a romantic diligence from the South Pacific, where he served in World War II as a radioman aboard seaplane tenders. He once addressed a letter to her ''The Most Beautiful Girl in the World, Bronxville, New York.'' Somehow, it reached her.         Mr. Russell, who later became president of Doyle Dane Bernbach, the advertising agency, proposed on his return from the war, suggesting Dec. 21 for their wedding because, as he said, it was the longest night of the year.         After Mrs. Russell retired from modeling, she became active in zoning and environmental issues in Pound Ridge, N.Y., where the couple lived for 37 years before moving to Bluffton, S.C.         In addion to her husband, she is survived by their three sons: John, of Stamford, Conn., David, of Hilton Head, S.C., and Mark, of Bedford, N.Y.
