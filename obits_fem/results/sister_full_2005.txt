         Lucy Freeman, a reporter and an author whose early coverage of psychiatry and mental health for The New York Times led to wider reporting on the subject, died on Wednesday at the Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale, in the Bronx. She was 88.         The cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease, said her nephew David L. Schroedel.         Ms. Freeman, one of the few women on the Times's reporting staff when she was hired in 1940, initially wrote light society features, but moved to breaking news with an award-winning story on the explosion of two ships hauling munitions in Galveston Bay, Tex., in 1947.         By the late 1940's, some time after she began undergoing her own psychoanalysis, she persuaded editors to allow coverage of the growth of psychiatry and the preservation of Sigmund Freud's private papers.         ''It was even more unusual because it was in an era in which psychology was not popular,'' said Nan Robertson, the author of ''The Girls in the Balcony: Women, Men and The New York Times.'' ''It used to be that people poked fun at getting shrunk.''         Over the course of four years, she reported on welfare, the stigma of mental illness and advancements in treatments for schizophrenic patients. She also studied mental health and welfare programs in the city hospital system.         Her nonfiction books, ranging from detailed studies of Freud to those exploring sources of anger and anxiety, helped familiarize a popular audience with what had long been a hush-hush practice.         Ms. Freeman's first book, ''Fight Against Fears,'' recounted her own experience as a psychoanalysis patient who struggled to overcome her shy, whispery voice and social fears. Published in 1951, the book was in print for 47 years.         Ms. Freeman also wrote 77 other books, including mystery novels and memoirs.         The first of four children born to a prominent New York family, Ms. Freeman was a member of the first graduating class at Bennington College in Vermont.         She was hired by The New York Times in 1940 and would later describe the newsroom of the day as ''a sea of male reporters.''         ''I hardly dared savor the glory. All those men,'' she wrote in a memoir, ''The Beloved Prison,'' (St. Martin's Press, 1989). ''I also dared the fleeting thought that among all these masculine forms perhaps I would find a husband.''         She eventually married William M. Freeman, an editor who had fixed an error in a story she filed from Texas. The marriage lasted two years.         Fond of low-cut dresses and high-heeled shoes, Ms. Freeman relished the attention she received from her male colleagues on the city desk, Ms. Robertson said. Mary Yost, Ms. Freeman's agent for more than 15 years, said that she digested academic papers like a scholar, but always preferred to write for a larger audience.         She could at times ''appear to be an ingénue, an innocent,'' Ms. Yost said, but she also played a mean game of poker, loved throwing large parties at her apartment with a view of Central Park, and mixed as easily with jockeys as she did with actors and intellectuals.         ''She enjoyed a popular audience for her work, and she wanted it in her social life, too,'' Ms. Yost said.         Ms. Freeman is survived by her brother, Edward Greenbaum of Clearwater, Fla; her sister, Sue Polera of Las Vegas; her sister and brother-in-law, Sally and Warren Rosenberg of Scarborough, N.Y.; and numerous nieces and nephews.       
         Suzie Frankfurt, an interior decorator who popularized 18th- and 19th-century Russian furniture among corporate raiders of the 1970's and 1980's and was an early collaborator of Andy Warhol, died on Jan. 7 at the Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale, in the Bronx. She was 73.         She had lived in Norfolk, Conn., until she became incapacitated several years ago after treatment of a brain tumor, her family said.         A bohemian hostess, the flame-haired Ms. Frankfurt was known as a creative catalyst as well as a celebrity decorator. The designer Gianni Versace, for example, credited her with introducing him to America when he was largely unknown, not to mention also introducing him to Studio 54.         The guest lists of her idiosyncratic cocktail parties included such unlikely pairings as Bill Blass and the jazz-rock group Blood, Sweat & Tears.         Ms. Frankfurt was born Suzanne Allen on Aug. 21, 1931, in Los Angeles, the daughter of Eva and Isidore Allen, the owner of a linen distribution company. A cousin was married to a son of the industrialist Norton Simon, and through that association she became part of a well-connected extended family that included the actress Jennifer Jones, who was married to Simon, and Simon's sister, Marcia Weisman, a prominent art collector.         After graduating with honors from Stanford, Ms. Allen moved to New York to work in the research department of the Young & Rubicam advertising agency, whose accounts included Norton Simon's food conglomerate. In 1956, she married Stephen O. Frankfurt, a graphic designer who was one of the agency's art directors; he later designed the titles for the film ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' and eventually became the president of Young & Rubicam. The couple divorced in 1968.         She is survived by her sons, Jaime and Peter, both of Los Angeles, and four grandchildren.         Research proved not to be Ms. Frankfurt's forte. Instead, she was given the responsibility of redecorating Young & Rubicam's lobby and executive conference rooms. Thirty years later, she had become one of the world's most admired interior decorators with a varied list of clients, including Robert Redford, Robert Mapplethorpe and a Florida bank chairman later convicted of fraud named David L. Paul. He was accused of paying Ms. Frankfurt some $389,000 in bank funds to decorate his home.         Connoisseur magazine called her a ''nostalgic romantic,'' explaining that her taste reflected an admiration for ''the ancient regime -- any regime, and the madder the king, the better.''         Ms. Frankfurt lived as well as she decorated, in a succession of town houses on the Upper East Side, all packed with Biedermeier and Russian antiques. ''I made Russian chic,'' she said in an interview with W magazine in 1993. ''Now, it's too chic.''         Though articles about Ms. Frankfurt's interior designs appeared frequently in Architectural Digest, The New York Times and other publications, she also occupied a small but significant niche in American art history, thanks to her friendship with Mr. Warhol.         She and Mr. Warhol met in 1959, and the friendship lasted a lifetime. In fact, the index of Mr. Warhol's published diaries has 34 entries for Ms. Frankfurt.         The first encounter occurred at Serendipity, an Upper East Side ice cream parlor, after she saw an exhibition of his watercolors. Their rapport was instantaneous, though tinged with opportunism. ''The only reason Andy liked me was because I was raised in Malibu with movie stars like Myrna Loy all around,'' Ms. Frankfurt said in an interview in The New York Observer years later. ''I liked Andy because I'd always felt my whole life that I was an outsider.''         Within the year, Ms. Frankfurt and Mr. Warhol produced ''Wild Raspberries,'' a spoof of haute cuisine cookbooks; the title was a tongue-in-cheek allusion to ''Wild Strawberries,'' the Ingmar Bergman film. Warhol illustrated the slender volume, which was colored by schoolchildren. The calligraphy text was the work of the artist's mother, Julia Warhola. Ms. Frankfurt prepared the recipes, which sounded like a cross between Julia Child and Edward Gorey, and included Omelette Greta Garbo (''always to be eaten alone in a candlelit room''). ,         ''Wild Raspberries'' failed to find an audience outside its creators' friends and families. It was probably just as well: only a few dozen copies were printed, each hand-bound by rabbis on the Lower East Side. In 1997, however, the book was reprinted by Bulfinch Press and received admiring reviews as an oddity.         Ms. Frankfurt herself called it ''a little dippy.''         Correction:  January 18, 2005, Tuesday  Because of an editing error, an obituary yesterday about Suzie Frankfurt, a New York decorator who was a friend and collaborator of Andy Warhol's, misstated the place of her first meeting with him. It was at the Plaza Hotel after she had seen an exhibition of his watercolors at the restaurant Serendipity; they did not meet at Serendipity.       
         Nell Rankin, an American mezzo-soprano who sang at the Metropolitan Opera for 25 years and was highly regarded for her warm-toned portrayals of Amneris in Verdi's ''Aida'' and in the title role in Bizet's ''Carmen,'' died last Thursday at Cabrini Medical Center in New York. She was 81, and lived in New York.         Her husband, Dr. Hugh Clark Davidson, said the cause was polycythemia vera, a bone marrow disease.         During her years at the Met, Ms. Rankin sang many of the major dramatic mezzo-soprano roles. Among them were Amneris, with which she made her debut on Nov. 22, 1951, and several other Verdi roles -- Eboli in ''Don Carlo,'' Azucena in ''Il Trovatore'' and Ulrica in ''Un Ballo en Maschera,'' as well as Carmen, Ortrud in Wagner's ''Lohengrin,'' Santuzza in Mascagni's ''Cavalleria Rusticana'' and Herodias in Strauss's ''Salome.'' She ended her Met career in 1976, singing Laura in Ponchielli's ''Gioconda.''         Nell Rankin was born in Birmingham, Ala., on Jan. 3, 1924, and she studied with Jeanne Lorraine at the Birmingham Conservatory. She was a determined performer, and when the soprano Helen Traubel visited Birmingham to sing a recital in 1943 Ms. Rankin went backstage and persuaded Ms. Traubel's accompanist, Coenraad Bos, to hear her sing. On Bos's advice, she moved to New York to continue her studies with Karin Branzell. She made her debut at Town Hall, in a joint recital with her sister, Ruth Rankin, a soprano, in March 1947. Her operatic debut in New York was in a production of ''Aida'' at the Salmaggi Opera Company, in Brooklyn, in which she sang Amneris and her sister sang the title role.         In 1948, Ms. Rankin joined the Zurich Opera Company, where she made her debut as Ortrud in ''Lohengrin'' in 1949, and went on to sing 126 performances in her first year. Her breakthrough, though, came in 1950, when she became the first American singer to win the first prize at the International Music Competition in Geneva.         That victory led to her debuts at La Scala and at the Vienna State Opera, both as Amneris, in 1951, and to her Met debut in the same role later that year. Debuts at Covent Garden and the San Francisco Opera followed in 1953. On both occasions, she sang the title role in ''Carmen.''         In addition to her performances at the Met, Ms. Rankin continued to sing at major houses around the world, including La Scala, where she sang Cassandra, in Berlioz's ''Troyens,'' in 1960, and the Teatro San Carlo, in Naples, where she sang Adalgisa in Bellini's ''Norma,'' in 1963. She also sang with companies in Chicago, Fort Worth, Buenos Aires, Havana, Mexico City and Athens.         Ms. Rankin was the star of a CBS television production of ''Carmen'' in 1954, and she made several recordings, including a 1961 account of Puccini's ''Madama Butterfly'' in which she sang Suzuki and Renata Tebaldi sang the title role. The performance was recently reissued by Naxos Records.         After she retired from the Met, Ms. Rankin devoted herself to teaching, first at the Academy of Vocal Arts in Philadelphia, and then privately in New York until she retired in 1991.         She is survived by her husband.       
         Georgia Macris, an editor of influential energy industry publications for three decades, died on Jan. 13 at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 86.         The cause was lung cancer, her sister, Sophie Hocknell, said.         Ms. Macris graduated from Radcliffe College in 1940. She joined the Red Cross and served in the Pacific during World War II.         She was hired by McGraw-Hill World News in New York in 1947. When McGraw-Hill began publishing Petroleum Week magazine in 1955, she was named an assistant editor and then, a year later, foreign news editor. In 1961, she was named foreign news editor of Platts Oilgram News, a newsletter published by McGraw-Hill.         In 1968, Ms. Macris moved to Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, a newsletter that was then independently published by Wanda Jablonski and is now part of the Energy Intelligence Group. Ms. Macris served as managing editor from 1970 and as editor from 1972, retiring in 1983.         Ms. Macris chronicled the transformation of the international oil industry from the 1950's. She charted how the business evolved from one dominated by major corporations to one controlled by the nationalized companies in the 1970's.         Ms. Macris is survived by her sister, Ms. Hocknell, of Salem, Mass.       
         Dr. Esther Thelen, a psychologist whose research into the way babies develop early motor and mental skills exerted a powerful influence in the field, died on Dec. 29 at a hospital in Bloomington, Ind. She was 63.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Jennifer Thelen of Richmond, Calif.         Dr. Thelen, a psychology professor at Indiana University, was known for studying childhood development through the conceptual framework called dynamic systems theory. Many psychologists had once believed that babies developed on a relatively rigid timetable, dictated by changes in the brain. But Dr. Thelen proposed that developmental milestones occurred through a complicated interaction involving the brain, the environment, the baby's growing awareness of its body and other factors.         ''She had a profound impact on the way people think about how kids develop,'' said Dr. John Spencer, a psychology professor at the University of Iowa, a friend and former colleague of Dr. Thelen's. ''She really viewed development at the level of the organism, the whole child, and showed that it's not just the genes or the brain but all these things coming together.''         Dr. Thelen also proposed that environmental experiences in the first year of life played an enormous role in shaping the neuronal networks in the brain that determine much of a growing child's abilities -- intellectually, creatively and in other ways.         Dr. Thelen was born on May 20, 1941, in Brooklyn. She attended Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, and in 1977 she received a doctorate in biology from the University of Missouri. She was a member of the university's psychology department until she left for Indiana in 1985.         In addition to her daughter, Dr. Thelen is survived by her husband, David, a history professor at Indiana; a son, Jeremy, of Providence, R.I.; a sister, Harriet Saeck of Sacramento; and one grandson.       
         Dr. Sonja Buckley, a Yale virologist and investigator who helped in 1970 to identify the Lassa virus, a potentially deadly disease that originated in Africa, died on Feb. 2 in Baltimore. She was 86.         Dr. Buckley died in a nursing home after a series of strokes, said a close friend, Joyce Maclay.         In the Nigerian village of Lassa in 1969, two missionary nurses rapidly became ill and developed symptoms that included high fever and mouth ulcers before they died from what came to be known as Lassa fever. A third nurse in Lassa contracted the virus and was evacuated to Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan, where she later recovered. Dr. Buckley, who was part of Yale's Arbovirus Research Unit at the time, began to study the virus, using samples of the nurse's blood.         Working with Dr. Wilbur Downs and Dr. Jordi Casals-Ariet, Dr. Buckley succeeded in using tissue cultures to isolate and identify the virus. In the process, Dr. Casals-Ariet himself fell ill and was treated with antibodies taken from the surviving nurse's blood. He recovered from the illness and lived until last year, when he died at 92. But a laboratory technician, Juan Roman, also contracted the fever and died in 1969.         Because of the risk of contagion, the research on the virus was transferred from Yale to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. The virus is transmitted by contact with infected rodents and can be passed from person to person through body fluids.         Dr. Curtis L. Patton, professor of epidemiology of microbial diseases at Yale, said that Dr. Buckley had provided strongly persuasive ''in vitro evidence'' of both the virus and the effectiveness of its antibodies, and ''went on in very remarkable work to demonstrate that antibodies taken from survivors were protective of tissue cultures'' and could be used in treatment.         Lassa fever continues to be endemic in Nigeria, Liberia and Sierra Leone. It is treated with a combination of antibodies, the antiviral drug ribavirin and what Dr. Patton called ''good, close nursing care.''         Dr. Buckley was born Sonja Grob in Zurich and received her medical degree in 1944 from the University of Zurich, where she was later an instructor in microbiology. In 1941, she married Dr. John J. Buckley, a pathologist also studying in Zurich.         After working as a research assistant at Johns Hopkins, she joined the Sloan-Kettering Institute, where she was chosen as head of the solid tumor program in 1949. Sonja Buckley then joined the Rockefeller Foundation in 1957, working in the foundation's virus laboratories. In 1964, the labs were transferred to Yale and became known as the Arbovirus Research Unit.         Dr. Buckley retired from Yale in 1994. She lived in Stamford, Conn., before moving to Baltimore about five years ago.         She is survived by a sister, Annemarie Kohler of Zurich.       
         Midori Shimanouchi Lederer, who as founder and president emeritus of Japanese American Social Services Inc. helped provide social services to Asians and Asian-Americans in New York, died on March 9 at her home in Manhattan. She was 81.         The cause was respiratory failure, her husband, Peter, said.         Mrs. Lederer founded the organization in 1981. It assists the elderly, abused women, hospital patients who do not speak English and others.         Midori Shimanouchi was born in Fresno, Calif., on April 11, 1923.         At age 18, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, she was interned with her family at Topaz, Utah. Two years later, she came to New York, where she worked as a film publicist. She later volunteered with the Lower East Side Center, which helped elderly drug addicts, and with Japanese American Help for the Aging.         The recipient of many awards, Mrs. Lederer shunned publicity, saying she did not wish to embarrass her clients.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Lederer is survived by a sister, Ida Shimanouchi, of Medford, N.J.; a stepdaughter, Patricia Lederer Michaels, of Manhattan; and one stepgrandson.       
         Cushing N. Dolbeare, a leading expert on federal housing policy and a longtime campaigner for affordable housing for low-income people, died on March 17 at her home in Mitchellville, Md. She was 78.         The cause was cancer, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, the research and advocacy group Ms. Dolbeare founded in 1974.         A respected policy analyst and consultant, Ms. Dolbeare was an adviser to several secretaries of housing and urban development and was a former member of the President's Commission on Housing. In 1996, The New York Times Magazine called her ''the dean of housing advocates.''         Ms. Dolbeare founded the coalition in response to President Richard M. Nixon's 1973 moratorium on federal housing subsidies. In the organization's early days, she ran it out of her Capitol Hill home. She was its executive director from 1977 to 1984 and from 1993 to 1994; at her death she was its chairwoman emeritus.         As Ms. Dolbeare explained in an interview with The New York Times in 1983, the lack of affordable housing was for poor people a chronic problem with limited available solutions.         ''Unlike food stamps or Medicaid or welfare, low-income housing is not an entitlement,'' she said. ''Just needing it does not mean you get it.''         Mary Cushing Niles was born in Hartford on June 25, 1926, the daughter of Henry Edward Niles and the former Mary Cushing Howard. Her parents were management consultants, and Ms. Dolbeare had a peripatetic childhood as they moved around the country from one consulting job to the next. By the time she graduated from high school, she had attended 10 to 20 schools, her family said.         Ms. Dolbeare earned a bachelor's degree in political science from Swarthmore College in 1949 and began her career as a housing advocate in 1951, as associate executive secretary of the Citizens Planning and Housing Association of Baltimore. From 1965 to 1971 she was managing director of the Housing Association of Delaware Valley and, from 1967 to 1968, a consultant for the United States Commission on Civil Rights.         Ms. Dolbeare served on the President's Commission on Housing from 1981 to 1982. In 2002, she received the Heinz Award for the Human Condition from the Heinz Family Foundation; she was named a senior scholar at the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard the same year.         Ms. Dolbeare is survived by her husband, Louis P. Dolbeare; a sister, Alice Lynd of Niles, Ohio; two children, L. Niles Dolbeare of San Francisco and Mary Dolbeare O'Kane of Seattle; and four grandchildren.       
         Katherine A. Lathrop, a pioneering researcher in nuclear medicine and a member of a University of Chicago team that developed an isotope widely used to locate and diagnose cancers, died on March 10 at a nursing home in Las Cruces, N.M. She was 89.         The cause was advanced dementia, her family said.         A versatile scientist with degrees in biology, chemistry and physics, Ms. Lathrop was named a professor of radiology at Chicago, where she taught for four decades, without having received a doctorate.         In 1945 and 1946, she participated in the Manhattan Project as a junior chemist in the metallurgical laboratory in Chicago, studying the effects of radioactive materials on animals. Later, as part of a research effort led by Dr. Paul V. Harper, she investigated the qualities of technetium, a radioactive element discovered in the 1930's.         Ms. Lathrop and the Chicago team experimented with an isotope, technetium 99m, by injecting it into a patient's bloodstream and then tracing its path through the brain, heart, kidney, liver and other organs.         A scan of the isotope, also called a radionuclide or radiotracer, yielded images to help diagnose and record the size and growth of cancers and other tumors. Dr. Harper's team also found technetium was less radioactive and had a shorter half-life than many other isotopes, and was therefore less dangerous to patients. A scanning system for technetium was perfected in 1963 and was used to perform a successful brain scan. The isotope remains in clinical use worldwide and is often used to scan bones.         Dr. Robert Beck, an emeritus professor of radiology at Chicago and a member of Dr. Harper's team, recalled that Ms. Lathrop was ''an indispensable part of Paul Harper's team.''         Dr. Beck added, ''After that initial successful scan, the field of nuclear medicine took a major and continuing upward turn.''         Katherine Gray Austin was born in Lawton, Okla. She graduated from Oklahoma State University, where she also received a master's degree in chemistry in 1939.         Ms. Lathrop was appointed an associate biochemist at the Argonne National Laboratory, where she worked from 1947 to 1954. She next joined the staff of the Argonne Cancer Research Hospital, now the Franklin McLean Memorial Research Institute, which is affiliated with the University of Chicago. In 1978, she was appointed professor of radiology at Chicago, a position she held until retiring in 1985.         Ms. Lathrop served as chairwoman of the Society of Nuclear Medicine's Medical Internal Radiation Dose Committee from 1977 to 1984.         Ms. Lathrop lived in Hyde Park, Ill., before moving to Las Cruces last year.         She is survived by a son, Dr. David Lathrop, a physiologist at the National Institutes of Health, of Gaithersburg, Md.; three daughters, Laura Fowler of Santa Fe, N.M., Jane Grider of Las Cruces and Julia Smiddy of Valparaiso, Ind.; a sister, Billie Carol Austin of Denver; a brother, John C. Austin of Duncan, Okla.; 10 grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.       
         Dr. Georgeanna S. Jones, who was half of a husband-and-wife team that created the first program for in vitro fertilization in the United States and its first ''test tube'' baby, died on Saturday at a hospital in Norfolk, Va. She was 92 and lived in Portsmouth, Va.         The cause was cardiac arrest, said her husband, Dr. Howard W. Jones.         Dr. Georgeanna Jones, one of the country's first reproductive endocrinologists, was a quiet leader in her field for four decades at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, where she taught and conducted research. But she unwittingly stepped into the national spotlight when she and her husband, a gynecological surgeon, moved to Eastern Virginia Medical School in 1978 and set out to open a clinic that would allow conception outside a mother's body.         The first in vitro baby was born that same year, in England, but the procedure had never been accomplished in the United States. After three years and fierce denunciation from opponents who raised moral and ethical questions, Dr. Jones and her husband announced the birth of Elizabeth J. Carr on Dec. 28, 1981. Just slightly underweight at 5 pounds 12 ounces, Elizabeth was the first American ''test-tube baby.''         ''It was a major development, which essentially allowed I.V.F. to develop and flourish in the United States,'' said Dr. Zev Rosenwaks, who trained under the Joneses and directs the Center for Reproductive Medicine and Infertility at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell.         The news quickly led to a flood of attention, kindling hope in infertile couples around the country and prompting many doctors to converge on Norfolk to learn the procedure. More than 114,000 babies have since been born through in vitro fertilization in the United States, about 3,000 of them at the clinic in Norfolk now called the Jones Institute for Reproductive Medicine.         ''Literally right after they succeeded, every doctor interested in the field marched through Norfolk,'' said Sherry Sontag, the author of a coming book, ''One in a Million: A History of I.V.F. and the Quest to Make One Tiny Baby.'' ''They trained many of today's leading experts, and those they didn't train were taught by their students.''         Dr. Jones is widely credited with inspiring generations of women in medicine. She lectured, wrote some 350 scientific articles and worked closely with many of the patients at her clinic. Slowly progressing Alzheimer's disease restricted her in the 1990's, but she kept an office at the institute and never lost touch with the first crop of children whose lives began in her laboratory.         ''I always joked that they were like my second set of grandparents,'' said Ms. Carr, who is 23 now and lives in St. Petersburg, Fla., working as an online reporter for the Poynter Institute. ''They would call me every Christmas and birthday. For a while, all of the I.V.F. babies born at the clinic would travel down there for Mother's Day reunions. We all feel like brothers and sisters.''         Ms. Carr says she wears a silver pendant, engraved with her initials and the number one, given to her by the Joneses.         Born in Baltimore on July 6, 1912, Georgeanna Seegar earned her undergraduate degree from Goucher College there and her medical degree from Johns Hopkins. She was the daughter of an obstetrician, Dr. J. King Seegar, who also delivered her future husband.         In 1939, while at Johns Hopkins, Dr. Jones helped establish and lead the first division of reproductive medicine in the country. Several decades later, she identified a disorder, called luteal phase defect, that causes deficiencies in the hormone progesterone and sometimes leads to miscarriages.         In 1978, Dr. Jones and her husband left Johns Hopkins for Eastern Virginia Medical School shortly after the birth of the world's first in vitro baby was announced in England. The couple had not intended to open a clinic until a former patient of Dr. Georgeanna Jones, after reading about the birth, sent the Joneses a grant for $5,000 and encouraged them to do the same. They agreed, but almost backed out when opponents questioned whether the procedure would lead to selective breeding and the destruction of embryos.         ''We only went ahead with it because the board of trustees at the medical school said, 'We're behind you, go ahead,''' Dr. Howard Jones said yesterday.         Within a year of Elizabeth Carr's birth, the Joneses had helped deliver about 10 more in vitro babies.         ''Despite the controversy,'' said Ms. Sontag, the writer, ''Georgeanna never lost sight of the fact that the most important part about I.V.F. was making babies.''         In addition to her husband of 64 years, Dr. Jones is survived by two sons, Dr. Howard Wilbur Jones III of Nashville and Lawrence Massey Jones of Denver; a daughter, Dr. Georgeanna Jones Klingensmith of Denver; a brother, King Seegar of Towson, Md.; a sister, Elizabeth Seegar of Silver Spring, Md.; seven grandchildren; and one great-grandson.       
         Faith McNulty, a New Yorker staff writer who wrote many books about animals and country life for adults and children, died last Sunday at her home in Wakefield, R.I. She was 86. The cause was complications of a stroke, her sister, Elisabeth Keiffer, said.         In 1980, Ms. McNulty notably departed from her usual subjects with "The Burning Bed: The True Story of an Abused Wife" (Harcourt), an account of how in 1977 Francine Hughes, a battered Michigan housewife, killed her husband by setting him on fire after he passed out from drinking. She was acquitted of murder by reason of temporary insanity.         In 1984, the book was made into an NBC-TV movie, with a de-glamorized Farrah Fawcett as the star. The film enhanced Ms. Hughes's image as an advocate for women's rights.         But Ms. McNulty's more usual line of work was books like "The Whooping Crane: The Bird That Defies Extinction" (Dutton, 1966) and "How to Dig a Hole to the Other Side of the World" (Harper, 1979), with illustrations by Marc Simont.         Ms. McNulty came to her interests early. Although a city child, born in New York on Nov. 28, 1918, she spent her childhood summers on her grandmother's farm in Wakefield. Her father, Joseph Eugene Corrigan, was a judge. Her original name was Faith Trumbull Corrigan.         Intending to become a writer, she attended Barnard College in 1937-38, but dropped out after a creative-writing teacher told her she had no talent.         In 1938, she married Charles M. Fair, a writer. The marriage ended in divorce. In 1945, she married John McNulty. She met him about 1942, her sister said in a telephone interview, when she was one of the first three copy girls hired by The Daily News, where he was a rewrite man. He had begun to sell stories to The New Yorker, and went to work there in 1944. He helped her to sell her first piece to the magazine. A decade later, in 1953, she was hired by the editor William Shawn as a Talk of the Town reporter.         After her husband's death, in 1956, Ms. McNulty settled permanently on a farm they had bought in Wakefield and began to write books. In 1957, she married Richard H. Martin, a prop designer for the theater. He died in 1984.         In addition to her sister, Ms. McNulty is survived by a son, John Joseph McNulty of Brooklyn, and four grandchildren.       
         Maria Schell, an Austrian actress who achieved international fame in Hollywood and became a major star of German-language films, died on Tuesday at her home in Preitenegg, Austria. She was 79.         The cause was heart failure, the mayor of Preitenegg, Franz Kogler, told the German news agency Deutsche Presse-Agentur.         Before she went to Hollywood in the 1950's, Ms. Schell, who was sometimes called ''the blond angel,'' was already a celebrated film figure in Austria, Germany and Switzerland, where she was often typecast as a charming girl from the Alps.         Ms. Schell was named best actress at the Cannes film festival in 1954 for her portrayal of a young doctor in ''Die Letzte Brücke'' (''The Last Bridge'') and became internationally known for her role as Grushenka in ''The Brothers Karamazov'' in 1958.         She also appeared in several American movies alongside actors like Gary Cooper, in ''The Hanging Tree'' in 1959, and Marlon Brando, in ''Superman'' in 1978.         Ms. Schell made more than 200 film and television appearances, mostly in German. She was also a prominent stage actress in Austria and Germany.         She was born in Vienna on Jan. 15, 1926, the daughter of a Swiss writer and an Austrian actress. She grew up with three siblings who all went into acting, including Maximilian, her younger brother by four years, who also became a star. In 1938, the family moved to Switzerland, where, in 1942, at the age of 16, she appeared in her first film, the Swiss ''Der Steinbruch'' (''The Quarry'').         Even though her debut was not very successful, Ms. Schell decided to study drama in Zurich. She did not make another movie until she starred in Karl Hartl's Austrian-German 1948 production ''Der Engel mit der Posaune'' (''The Angel With the Trumpet''), the first film to bring her recognition abroad.         In 2002, Ms. Schell made her last public appearance at a presentation of ''Meine Schwester Maria'' (''My Sister Maria''), Maximilian's documentary about her life.         The Austrian film critic Alexander Horwath said she was ''one of the very few stars of postwar German-speaking cinema who had a lasting impact on the international film scene,'' Agence France-Presse reported.         Ms. Schell's two marriages ended in divorce. Her first husband was the film director Horst Hächler. Her second marriage, to the Austrian actor Veit Relin, ended after 22 years in 1988. In her last years, Ms. Schell suffered several strokes and led a secluded life at her home in the Alps.         Survivors include Maximilian; her son, Oliver, from her first marriage; and her daughter, Marie-Theres, from her second marriage.       
         Charlotte Kempner Beyers, a documentary filmmaker whose works were among the first to introduce students to the realities of AIDS, died on March 10 at her home in Palo Alto, Calif. She was 73.         The cause was complications of lymphoma, her family said.         The producer and writer of 15 films, Ms. Beyers began her career as a print journalist, writing about science and education for a variety of publications. She made her first film, ''AIDS in Your School,'' after a brother-in-law's death from AIDS in 1985. That film, along with her later ones about AIDS, was distributed to schools and youth groups by the World Health Organization.         Ms. Beyers's other films include ''A Is for AIDS'' and ''AIDS and Women: The Greatest Gamble,'' as well as movies about drug abuse, disability and homelessness.         Charlotte Kempner was born in Manhattan on Dec. 8, 1931; her father, S. Marshall Kempner, was a prominent investment banker. She earned a bachelor's degree in English from Stanford University in 1953 and a master's in journalism from Stanford in 1968.         Ms. Beyers's first marriage, to Gerald Davis, ended in divorce. Her second husband, Robert West Beyers, died in 2002. She is survived by a sister, Phyllis Kempner; four children from her first marriage: Pamela Davis Kivelson, Nancy Stewart, Alan Davis and Cynthia Kanner; three stepchildren: Bill Beyers, Robbie Beyers and Amy Theorin; and 13 grandchildren and step-grandchildren.       
         Carol Rothschild Noyes, a supporter of civic and environmental causes, died on April 18 at her home in Laurel Hollow, N.Y. She was 88.         Her family announced the death.         Mrs. Noyes sat on the boards of the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Center, Planned Parenthood of New York City, and the Rocky Mountain Institute in Old Snowmass, Colo. She was a trustee of the Brearley School and Vassar College.         Carol Warburg Rothschild was born in Manhattan. She graduated from Vassar in 1939, and in the late 1940's she and a friend, Dottie Noyes, owned a New York furniture store, New Design, that sold contemporary creations by the Eameses, Saarinen and Aalto.         Mrs. Noyes's first marriage, to Amory Bradford, ended in divorce in 1963; he died in 1998. She was the widow of Charles P. Noyes, who died in 1994. She is survived by two sons, Peter A. Bradford of Peru, Vt., and David A. Bradford of Guilford, Vt.; three daughters, Carola Lea of Lyme, N.H., Madhavi Bradford of Darlington, Idaho, and Deborah Bradford of Aspen, Colo.; a sister, Phyllis Farley of Manhattan; two stepsons, Charles P. Noyes III of Spencertown, N.Y., and James McC. Noyes of Hood River, Ore.; and eight grandchildren.       
         Evelyn Annenberg Jaffe Hall, a New York arts patron for 50 years and a supporter of medical institutions, died on April 22 at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 93 and also had homes in Palm Beach, Fla., and Newport, R.I.         Mrs. Hall, a sister of the late publisher Walter H. Annenberg, shared her fortune with many beneficiaries. Among her favorites were the Museum of Modern Art and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.         Mrs. Hall was born in Milwaukee. Her parents were Moses and Sadie Annenberg. She graduated from the Calhoun School and studied at the Art Students League of New York. With her second husband, William Jaffe, she assembled an outstanding art collection that included European paintings, sculpture and antique furniture; Chinese porcelain; pre-Colombian artifacts; and Renaissance drawings.         A member of the Modern Museum's International Council since 1970, a trustee since 1979 and a leading member of various museum committees, she stood in the forefront of donors to its collections. Among the works she gave to the museum were pieces by Bonnard, Picasso, Miró and Vuillard. Another notable gift, made with Mr. Jaffe, was a selection of 16 prints by Edvard Munch.         Mrs. Hall was a benefactor of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Brooklyn Museum as well. She financed a scholarship in art history at Yale University and in 1960 endowed the Jaffe-Friede Art Gallery at Dartmouth College.         She was also a donor to Mount Sinai Hospital, where she endowed a lecture series at the medical school.         Mrs. Hall's first marriage, to Kenneth Friede, ended in divorce. In 1947 she married Mr. Jaffe, a corporate lawyer; he died in 1972. She later married Melville Hall of Palm Beach, who died in 1991. She is survived by three sons, John Friede of Rye, N.Y., Robert Friede of Newton, Mass., and Thomas Jaffe of Manhattan; a sister, Enid Haupt of Greenwich, Conn.; three grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.       
         Margaret Popkin, an American lawyer who worked to overhaul the judicial system in strife-torn El Salvador, died on May 18 at a hospital in Washington. She was 54.         The cause was complications of heart surgery, her family said.         After working in California as an immigration lawyer for Central American refugees, Ms. Popkin moved to El Salvador in 1985.         There she served as deputy director of the Human Rights Institute at the University of Central America, where six Jesuit priests and two others were assassinated in 1989. Ms. Popkin traveled the country investigating human rights abuses at a time of internal warfare and corruption.         Ms. Popkin continued her work after moving back to the United States in 1993. She served as a consultant to members of United Nations commissions on El Salvador and published a book on the subject, ''Peace Without Justice: Obstacles to Building the Rule of Law in El Salvador,'' in 2000. In 1999 she became director of the Due Process of Law Foundation in Washington.         Margaret L. Popkin was born on May 21, 1950, in Iowa City. She had an undergraduate degree from the University of California, San Diego, a master's degree in women's studies from Goddard College in Vermont and a law degree from the Boalt Hall School of Law at the University of California, Berkeley.         Ms. Popkin is survived by her mother, Juliet, of Los Angeles; her son, Joel, of Silver Spring, Md.; her brother, Jeremy, of Lexington, Ky.; her sister, Susan, of Vienna, Va.; three nephews, Gabriel Popkin, Alexander Popkin and Zachary Popkin-Hall; and a niece, Rachel Kang Popkin-Hall.       
         Anne Bancroft, the stage and film star whose signature triumphs in a 50-year career ranged from the courageous Annie Sullivan in ''The Miracle Worker'' to the hungrily seductive Mrs. Robinson in ''The Graduate,'' died on Monday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 73 and had homes in Manhattan and Los Angeles. The cause was uterine cancer, said John Barlow, a spokesman for Ms. Bancroft's husband, Mel Brooks.         Graced with a sultry voice and expressive mouth, Ms. Bancroft could appear both tough and vulnerable, and she eagerly sought out nearly every kind of role, maturing effortlessly over the decades. She lent a singular potency to parts as varied as Brecht's ''Mother Courage'' and the mother superior of a convent, and from an aging ballerina to Prime Minister Golda Meir of Israel. She repeatedly won praise for her work, as well as an Academy Award and two Tonys.         Arthur Penn, who directed her award-winning Broadway performances in ''Two for the Seesaw'' and ''The Miracle Worker,'' both by William Gibson, put it this way: ''More happens in her face in 10 seconds than happens in most women's faces in 10 years.'' Broadway lights were scheduled to be dimmed tonight in her honor.         Ms. Bancroft worked hard to get beneath the surface, to inhabit a role as deeply as possible. While rehearsing for her role as the young Helen Keller's teacher in ''The Miracle Worker,'' she put tape over her eyes better to understand what it was like to be blind, learned sign language and spent time at a home for the visually impaired. Preparing for ''Golda,'' she traveled to Israel and got to know and observe Meir. She was more interested in performance than theory, although she was a member of the Actors Studio early in her career. The actor Rod Steiger once gave her a copy of Stanislavsky's writings on acting. ''I still have it,'' she said some years later, ''but I've never read it.''         The landmarks in Ms. Bancroft's acting life were, unquestionably, the two Gibson plays and ''The Graduate.'' She had already accumulated a long list of credits in TV dramas when she moved to Hollywood in the early 1950's to join the crowd of young hopefuls jostling for jobs in second- or third-rate films. She was among the few who found steady work, appearing in more than a dozen grade-C features with titles like ''Treasure of the Golden Condor,'' ''Gorilla at Large'' -- ''I played the title role'' -- and ''Demetrius and the Gladiators.'' Disenchanted after five years or so, and newly divorced, she headed back to New York with the promise of an audition for a new Broadway play called ''Two for the Seesaw.''         It was a two-character play, with Henry Fonda starring as a depressed Midwestern lawyer with marital troubles who comes to New York and meets Gittel Mosca, an attractive, thoroughly quirky young bohemian girl from the Bronx. They are two lost souls who, though their life styles are worlds apart, manage to help one another. Ms. Bancroft, who happened to be not only attractive and quirky but also Bronx-born and raised, auditioned and got the job. After a rocky start -- she had virtually no stage experience -- she quickly settled into the role. When the play opened in 1958, Ms. Bancroft stole the show and ultimately won a Tony Award as best supporting actress.         When the next Gibson-Penn theater project took shape the following year -- the story of Helen Keller and Annie Sullivan -- they knew who would play Sullivan from Day 1. The part of the hostile, 10-year-old Helen went to Patty Duke. Between them, Ms. Bancroft and Ms. Duke tore up the stage as Sullivan struggled to communicate with and calm her raging young charge, eventually breaking through the child's defensive shell. ''The Miracle Worker'' was a resounding hit, and Ms. Bancroft came away with her second Tony Award, this time as best actress. Tonys also went to Mr. Penn, Mr. Gibson and the play's producer, Fred Coe. Two years, two plays, two Tonys. And when ''The Miracle Worker'' was made into a film in 1962, both Ms. Bancroft and Ms. Duke won Academy Awards.         Hollywood now had a new star, and Ms. Bancroft was offered scripts rather better than, say, ''Gorilla at Large.'' She appeared with Peter Finch in ''The Pumpkin Eater'' (1964), Harold Pinter's adaptation of a novel by Penelope Mortimer about a woman driven into a nervous breakdown by her husband's casual philandering. Her work brought her an Oscar nomination. Next came ''The Slender Thread'' (1965), in which she played a housewife whose crumbling marriage leads her to attempt suicide.         By the time ''The Graduate'' came along, she was more than ready to play the alpha female and she got her wish with the character of Mrs. Robinson, the bored predator whose sexual binges with young Benjamin Braddock, the son of her husband's law partner are mechanical but necessary props for her self-indulgent ego. Directed by Mike Nichols, with a melancholic soundtrack of songs by Simon and Garfunkel, ''The Graduate'' was hailed as a winning social satire. Bosley Crowther, writing in The New York Times, called it ''devastating and uproarious'' and hailed Ms. Bancroft's ''sullenly contemptuous and voracious performance.'' Mr. Nichols won an Oscar, while nominations went to Ms. Bancroft, Mr. Hoffman and Katharine Ross, who played Mrs. Robinson's daughter. The still photograph that appeared in advertisements for the film, showing Mrs. Robinson slowly peeling off a nylon stocking under the glazed gaze of Mr. Hoffman's Benjamin, became a classic of its kind.         Anna Maria Louisa Italiano was born on Sept. 17, 1931, in the Bronx to Italian immigrant parents. Her father, Michael, was a patternmaker, and her mother, Mildred, a telephone operator. By the time she was 2 years old she was learning to sing and dance. ''Why play with dolls,'' she recalled years later, ''when you can sing 'I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate' on the street corner?'' Even so, by the time she left high school she had decided to become a laboratory technician. Instead, her mother insisted that she attend the New York Academy of Dramatic Arts.         Two years later she found work in television where, as Anne Marno, she appeared in scores of dramatic shows. In 1951 she was asked to participate in another actor's screen test for 20th Century Fox, after which she, not he, was offered the contract that took her to Hollywood. At the studio she was handed a book of names and urged to choose a new one. She became Anne Bancroft. She had no illusions about that chapter of her film career, noting some years later that ''20th Century Fox told me what to do and I did it. I learned nothing.''         During her first stay in Hollywood she married Martin A. May, a building contractor, in 1954. They were divorced in 1957. In 1964 she married Mr. Brooks, who survives her, as does their son, Maximilian. Also surviving are her mother and two sisters, Joanne and Phyllis.         In the 1970's and 80's Ms. Bancroft took on a variety of roles, from Winston Churchill's American-born mother in ''Young Winston'' to the actress-wife of a hammy Polish impresario (''world famous in Poland''), played by Mr. Brooks, in the farcical ''To Be or Not to Be.'' She also earned two more Oscar nominations, one for her portrayal of a ballerina confronting her choice of career over family in ''The Turning Point,'' the other for her work as a mother superior in ''Agnes of God.'' Other major roles included '''Night Mother,'' as a woman struggling with her daughter's decision to commit suicide, and ''84 Charing Cross Road,'' in which she played an American writer whose correspondence with a London bookseller (Anthony Hopkins) develops into a long-distance romance.         She rarely returned to the theater, although she did win praise as the steel-willed Regina Giddens in Mr. Nichols's 1967 staging of Lillian Hellman's ''Little Foxes'' at Lincoln Center. In The Times, Clive Barnes characterized her performance as ''a series of unforgettable visual and aural images.'' The following year Ms. Bancroft appeared in the Lincoln Center Repertory production of another William Gibson drama, ''A Cry of Players,'' set in Shakespearean England. Her performance in ''Golda'' (1977) brought her a Tony nomination. She played a crippled violinist the 1981 ''Duet for One,'' which closed after a two-week run, and then was absent from the stage until the spring of 2002, when she was set to star in Edward Albee's ''Occupant'' as the sculptor Louise Nevelson. The play's scheduled run had to be canceled when Ms. Bancroft contracted pneumonia during previews.         In later years she continued to appear in films, although the roles grew smaller. She was briefly on screen as Nicolas Cage's mother in ''Honeymoon in Vegas,'' trained a young woman as an assassin in ''Point of No Return,'' scored a few points as a wily Senator in ''G.I. Jane'' and had some campy fun in an updated version of ''Great Expectations'' as a loony character based on Dickens's Miss Havisham.         She fared better in television, earning Emmy nominations playing a killer in the PBS drama ''Mrs. Cage'' and the title role in ''Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All'' on CBS.         She was resigned to the fact that age and changing times worked against her. In a 1992 interview in The Times she admitted to taking parts ''even if they're one page,'' because ''there are very few good scripts, even for Julia Roberts.'' She preferred a good bit part to a heftier bad one. She often rejected work in favor of family life -- for a while. ''I retire after every project,'' she once said. ''Then somehow there's always something that pulls me out of retirement.''         Correction:  June 18, 2005, Saturday  The obituary of the actress Anne Bancroft on June 8 misstated the name of the acting school she attended and omitted a major award. The school was the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, not the New York Academy. Ms. Bancroft won an Emmy in 1999 for best supporting actress in a mini-series, for the CBS drama ''Deep in My Heart.''       
         Audrey G. Hochberg, a former New York State assemblywoman, died yesterday morning at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia hospital in Manhattan. She was 71 and lived in Scarsdale.         The cause was uterine cancer, her daughter Judith Hochberg said.         A Democrat, Ms. Hochberg represented the 88th Assembly District, which includes Scarsdale, Eastchester, Pelham and parts of New Rochelle and White Plains. First elected in 1992, she retired in 2000 after four terms.         Ms. Hochberg, who held public office for nearly three decades, was noted for her work on environmental, civil-rights and gun-control issues. She began her political career as a member of the Westchester County Board of Legislators, only the second woman, and at the time one of the few Democrats, to win a seat there.         Audrey Elaine Golden was born in Stamford, Conn., on June 26, 1933, the daughter of Abraham H. Golden and the former Fannie Dodek. She earned a bachelor's degree in economics from Radcliffe in 1955 and married Herbert L. Hochberg the same year.         Ms. Hochberg first worked as a security analyst with Shields & Company, a brokerage house, but later set her career aside to raise three children. She became politically active during the Vietnam era, working in the antiwar movement and in Democratic Party politics. In 1971 she was elected to the Westchester County legislature, where she served for 21 years.         In the State Assembly, Ms. Hochberg, the chairwoman of the Legislative Commission on Solid Waste Management, sponsored bills aimed at improving the state's recycling programs.         Besides her husband and daughter, both of Scarsdale, Ms. Hochberg is survived by a sister, Merle Bogin, of Manhattan; another daughter, Brenda Hochberg, of Brookline, Mass.; and seven grandchildren. A third daughter, Carol, died in 1998.       
         Clare Lynch O'Brien, an author, editor and consultant to children's television, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 62.         The cause was breast cancer, her sister Eileen Lynch Sussan said.         Mrs. O'Brien was a senior children's editor at Random House and a longtime colleague of Fred Rogers, the children's television host. Together they wrote ''Mr. Rogers Talks With Families About Divorce.'' She was also a consultant for ''Big Blue Marble,'' a children's show on public television. She later worked as an interior designer.         Clare Lynch was born in Manhattan on April 23, 1943, and graduated from the State University of New York at Cortland in 1965. She married Richard F. O'Brien, an advertising executive, in 1973. They lived in Manhattan, Washington and Nantucket, Mass.         In addition to her husband and her sister Eileen, of Stamford, Conn., Mrs. O'Brien is survived by her daughter, Kate, of Nantucket; her son, Miles, of Cockeysville, Md.; her brothers Daniel Lynch of Richmond, Va., and Thomas Lynch, of Greenwich, Conn.; and three other sisters, Moira Crabtree of West Caldwell, N.J., Sheila Casey of Washington and Elizabeth Berman of Los Angeles.       
         Lillian Lux, the matriarch of a celebrated Yiddish theatrical family who performed for decades as an actress and singer in New York and around the world, died on Saturday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 86 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was congestive heart failure, her son, Mike Burstyn, said.         With her husband, Pesach Burstein, Ms. Lux starred inYiddish-language plays and musicals from the 1930's on. Among her most famous roles was Feygele in the operetta ''A Khasene in Shtetl'' (''A Village Wedding''), which she played opposite her husband. In later years, the couple performed with their two children as the Four Bursteins.         The family was the subject of a documentary, ''The Komediant,'' shown in the United States in 2002. Directed by Arnon Goldfinger, an Israeli filmmaker, the film is narrated by Ms. Lux.         The first decades of the 20th century were the glory days of the Yiddish stage, with more than a dozen theaters in New York City alone. To their devoted fans, who packed the seats for original productions and adaptations of the classics, Ms. Lux and Mr. Burstein were the Lunt and Fontanne of the Lower East Side.         In the late 1940's Ms. Lux had her own Yiddish-language radio show on WEVD-AM. But by the 1950's, with theatergoers graying and many American Jews assimilating, Yiddish theater began to disappear. By the 1970's, it was almost completely gone. ''The Komediant'' chronicles the family's peripatetic existence as they travel to Europe, South America and Israel in pursuit of an ever more elusive audience.         Lillian Sylvia Lukashefsky was born in Brooklyn on June 20, 1918; her family Americanized its surname when she was young. She began her stage training as a child with the Yiddish Art Theater, run by the impresario Maurice Schwartz. As a teenager, she played the Catskills, performing opposite Danny Kaye.         At 17 Ms. Lux met Mr. Burstein, more than 20 years her senior and an established star. He was looking for an actress for his South American tour. After making the requisite good impression on Ms. Lux's parents, he hired her. They set sail and were married in Uruguay in 1938.         In the late 1930's, the couple toured Poland, catching the last ship out before the Nazis invaded in September 1939. After the war, they returned to Europe. Little of their audience remained. In the 1950's, the Bursteins went to Israel but found it difficult for Yiddish theater to take root there. They had better success a decade later, when they returned with ''The Megilla of Itzik Manger.'' The show, a musical version of the Book of Esther starring Ms. Lux, her husband and son, came to Broadway in a Yiddish-English production in 1968.         After her husband's death in 1986, Ms. Lux performed in a one-woman show and appeared often on radio.         Besides her son, of Los Angeles (an actor on Broadway and in films, Mr. Burstyn changed the spelling of his name as an adult), Ms. Lux is survived by a daughter, Susan Roth of Westfield, N.J.; and a sister, Beatrice Friedman of Washington.       
         Frieda Zames, a prominent advocate for the disabled who lobbied to make New York City accessible to them, died yesterday morning at her home in Manhattan. She was 72.         The cause has not been determined, said Anne Emerman, a longtime friend. She said Ms. Zames had been recovering at home from a recent appendectomy.         Ms. Zames, a retired mathematics professor, was a past president of Disabled in Action of Metropolitan New York, an advocacy group. At her death, she was a vice president of the organization.         Over the last several decades, Ms. Zames, who used a motorized scooter because of the effects of childhood polio, worked to improve access in places like subway stations, movie theaters, stores, restaurants and public restrooms. Her work helped make city buses wheelchair-accessible beginning in the 1980's; in recent years, she lobbied for wheelchair access to taxis and ferryboats.         With her sister, Doris Zames Fleischer, Ms. Zames wrote ''The Disability Rights Movement: From Charity to Confrontation'' (Temple University, 2001), a historical survey.         Frieda Zames was born in Brooklyn in 1932. She earned an undergraduate degree from Brooklyn College and a doctorate in mathematics from New York University. Until her retirement, she taught for many years at the New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark.         In addition to her sister, of Brooklyn, Ms. Zames is survived by her partner of more than 30 years, Michael Imperiale.       
         Shana Alexander, a journalist and television personality best known as the liberal sparring partner of the conservative commentator James J. Kilpatrick on the television newsmagazine ''60 Minutes'' in the 1970's, died on Thursday in Hermosa Beach, Calif. She was 79 and had lived in Manhattan and Wainscott, N.Y., for many years.         The cause was cancer, her family said. She had been in an assisted living facility.         A former columnist for Newsweek and Life magazines, Ms. Alexander joined ''60 Minutes'' in 1975 as the liberal voice of its debate segment, ''Point/Counterpoint.'' Once a week for nearly five years, she and Mr. Kilpatrick, a columnist for The Washington Star, locked horns over some of the most divisive issues of the day, including drugs, women's liberation and the Vietnam War. ''60 Minutes'' dropped the segment in 1979.         Ms. Alexander also wrote several nonfiction books, including ''Anyone's Daughter'' (Viking, 1979), about Patty Hearst; ''Very Much a Lady: The Untold Story of Jean Harris and Dr. Herman Tarnower'' (Little, Brown, 1983); and ''When She Was Bad'' (Random House, 1990), about the Bess Myerson conspiracy trial.         In 1995, she published a memoir, ''Happy Days: My Mother, My Father, My Sister and Me'' (Doubleday), an account of her privileged but loveless childhood.         Shana Ager was born in Manhattan on Oct., 6, 1925. Her father, Milton Ager, was a successful Tin Pan Alley composer whose tunes included ''Ain't She Sweet'' and ''Happy Days Are Here Again,'' which became a Democratic Party anthem. Ms. Alexander's mother, Cecelia, was a film critic for Variety and the New York newspaper PM.         Shana and her younger sister spent their early childhood in the family's opulent home on West 57th Street. In later years, the family lived in a string of elegant hotels. Her parents numbered Irving Berlin, the Gershwin brothers and the Marx Brothers among their friends.         Ms. Alexander earned a bachelor's degree in anthropology from Vassar in 1945. While in college, she worked as a copy girl for PM and after graduating became a reporter there; her first assignment was to interview the stripper Gypsy Rose Lee. Ms. Alexander was later an entertainment editor at Flair magazine.         In 1951, Ms. Alexander was the first woman to be named a staff writer of Life. She wrote a regular column, The Feminine Eye, for the magazine from 1964 to 1969. From 1969 to 1971, she was the editor of McCall's magazine, the first woman in nearly half a century to hold the job.         Ms. Alexander joined ''60 Minutes'' on Jan. 5, 1975, replacing the journalist Nicholas von Hoffman. Though she and Mr. Kilpatrick were friends off camera, their on-camera arguments were so famously heated, and so exquisitely literate, that they were regularly parodied by ''Saturday Night Live'' in its mock newscast, ''Weekend Update.''         Playing a character modeled on Ms. Alexander, Jane Curtin would begin the segment with a stream of impassioned statements. Dan Aykroyd, as Mr. Kilpatrick's alter ego, would invariably retort, ''Jane, you ignorant slut.'' She would shoot back, ''Dan, you pompous ass.''         In the years after ''60 Minutes,'' Ms. Alexander turned to writing accounts of true crime, which often opened windows onto larger issues like sex roles and social class and, in some cases, onto Ms. Alexander's own life. In most of her books, the central figures were women whose lives of privilege had caused them little but sorrow.         Many reviewers praised Ms. Alexander's strong characterizations, eye for detail and ability to capture entire social milieus. But some critics took her to task for identifying with her subjects too strongly. Her biography of Jean S. Harris, convicted in 1981 in the shooting death of her lover, the diet doctor Herman Tarnower, is an impassioned portrait of Ms. Harris as the victim of a domineering man. Ms. Alexander later publicly supported clemency for Ms. Harris. (Ms. Harris's sentence was commuted in December 1992.)         If Ms. Alexander felt a kinship with her subjects, she had good reason: she too was reared in icy splendor, by a remote, glamorous mother. Reviewing her memoir, ''Happy Days,'' in The New York Times Book Review, Delia Ephron called it ''heartbreaking,'' adding: ''There is no physical cruelty in this tale, just the awesome power of withheld love.''         Ms. Alexander's two marriages ended in divorce. Her only child, Kathy, died in 1987 at the age of 25 in a fall from Ms. Alexander's Park Avenue apartment building, an apparent suicide. Ms. Alexander's sister, Laurel Bentley of Manhattan Beach, Calif., is her only immediate survivor.         Among Ms. Alexander's other books are ''Nutcracker: Money, Madness, Murder'' (Doubleday, 1985); ''The Pizza Connection: Lawyers, Money, Drugs, Mafia'' (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1988); ''Marking Time: Letters From Jean Harris to Shana Alexander'' (Scribner, 1991); and ''The Astonishing Elephant'' (Random House, 2000).         Though Ms. Alexander always considered herself a print journalist, it was her gleeful, if carefully scripted, battles with Mr. Kilpatrick that made her famous. ''Imagine having to explain the facts of life to Jack Kilpatrick on national TV,'' Ms. Alexander said in a 1976 segment on maternity leave.         And from Mr. Kilpatrick, in a 1977 broadcast: ''If ever I heard an oversimplified fairy tale of the last years in Vietnam, I just heard one from you.''         Their act, Ms. Alexander knew, had a time-honored antecedent. ''Unwittingly,'' she told Publishers Weekly in 1979, ''we have reinvented an ancient classical art form known as the 'Punch and Judy Show.'''       
         Grete Sultan, a pianist and teacher who was both a performer of Bach and Schubert and a mentor to John Cage and his contemporaries, died in her sleep at St. Vincent's Hospital last Sunday morning. She was 99.         ''Basically, her heart gave out,'' said Robert Jurgrau, a former student and close friend. She had been hospitalized for about a week with pneumonia.         Ms. Sultan was a matter-of-fact proponent of the avant-garde. Her calling cards included Bach's Goldberg Variations, which she performed with all the repeats in downtown New York and, later, in uptown concert halls -- which, in the 1940's, before Glenn Gould's 1955 recording helped make the piece familiar fare, was practically outré.         But Ms. Sultan was open to all kinds of music. She met Cage in 1945; his ''Études Australes'' from the mid-1970's, based on notes derived from star charts, were written for her. Other contemporary composers whose works she performed included Earle Brown, Stefan Wolpe, Alan Hovhaness, Ben Weber and Christian Wolff, one of her students.         She said in a 1996 interview: ''Music is music. That's all.''         Johanna Margarete Sultan was born on June 21, 1906, in Berlin. Her family was musical -- two of her aunts had studied with Clara Schumann -- and Richard Strauss, Artur Schnabel, and Ferruccio Busoni were regular visitors to her childhood home. So was the American pianist Richard Buhlig, who introduced her to the composer Henry Cowell and the music of other contemporary composers. At the Hochschule für Musik in Berlin, she completed a course of study in only three years, working with Leonid Kreutzer. But a more important mentor was the pianist and conductor Edwin Fischer, teacher of Alfred Brendel, Paul Badura-Skoda and Daniel Barenboim, with whom she began private lessons after graduation.         Her burgeoning concert career was, however, abruptly curtailed by Hitler's rise to power, after which Jewish pianists could no longer play German music, although Arturo Toscanini set up some recitals for her in Italy. In 1941, Buhlig helped her escape to the United States, where she arrived with a suitcase and the clothes on her back. (Her mother was able to join her in 1946; a sister also managed to escape.)         Ms. Sultan began teaching at Vassar College and at the 92nd Street Y in New York before taking a post at the Masters' School in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., in 1952, which she held until 1971. It was Buhlig who introduced her to his former student Cage; Ms. Sultan, in turn, introduced Cage to her student Mr. Wolff, who gave Cage his first copy of the I Ching. In addition to Mr. Wolff, her students included the composer Lucia Dlugoszewskiwho moved to New York to study Bach with her in 1948 and ended up meeting the choreographer Erick Hawkins, who had a studio next door.         Ms. Sultan also continued to perform in concert throughout her life, winning praise for her natural, unflashy manner and musical integrity, and doggedly following her own musical tastes through the years, performing now Schubert, now Schoenberg, now Stravinsky, now Cage or Feldman without proselytizing and with equal aplomb. In 1996, shortly after her 90th birthday, she played the Goldberg Variations at Merkin Hall. The same year brought the release of the first of two retrospective CD sets that give a flavor of her performances and the breadth of her repertory.         ''She clearly strives for something higher from music than emotion or adventure,'' wrote Mark Swed, the Los Angeles Times music critic, after that 1996 concert. ''Her Bach has the modernist's attention paid to the smallest detail of sound and structure. The feeling here is that the spirit will soar much higher if it isn't pushed.''         She leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Elizabeth C. Beine, a retired director of New York City's Bureau of Child Welfare, who for more than a decade oversaw one of the largest child welfare programs in the world, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 96.         Susan Vail, a longtime friend, confirmed the death.         Ms. Beine (pronounced BYE-nee) was the director of the bureau, then part of the city's Department of Welfare, from 1962 to 1975. The bureau provided a range of services, including counseling, temporary shelter and long-term foster care.         The bureau became Special Services for Children in 1974 and the Child Welfare Administration in 1989. In 1996 the city established the Administration for Children's Services as a separate agency.         During Ms. Beine's tenure the bureau started the city's first protective-services program, which allowed needy children to receive help at home rather than being sent to foster care. The bureau also instituted the city's first family day care programs, which provided child care at home instead of in an institution.         Elizabeth Charlene Beine was born in Manhattan on July 4, 1909; her mother was a social worker with the New York Mission Society. Ms. Beine earned an undergraduate degree from Hunter College and, in 1949, a master's degree from the New York School of Social Work.         In 1950 Ms. Beine joined the Welfare Department, where she eventually supervised the city's three children's shelters. After retiring as bureau director in 1975, she became an executive with the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies.         Ms. Beine is survived by a sister, Deanie Alexander of Manhattan.       
         Judith Rossner, a novelist who used crisp, piercing prose to tell of women pushed to often grotesque extremes, most famously in her 1975 book ''Looking for Mr. Goodbar,'' died on Tuesday at New York University Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 70.         The cause was not immediately determined, Rayner Pike, her brother-in-law, told The Associated Press.         Ms. Rossner marshaled intriguing plot twists, precise description and deep empathy to examine women's experiences, addressing situations like pregnancy, sex with strangers and the introduction of a man into a single-parent household.         ''Many of her novels offer a clinical dissection of America's failed marriages and of a culture that has not permitted women to have a life apart from their children and husband,'' said the reference book Contemporary Novelists.         ''Mr. Goodbar,'' the fourth of Ms. Rossner's 10 novels, sold four million copies and in 1977 became a popular movie starring Diane Keaton. The book was based loosely on the 1973 murder of a young schoolteacher in New York who frequented singles bars and could be read as a particularly harrowing caution for the sexually adventurous.         Her seventh novel, ''August,'' published in 1983, was also a best seller. It is about of the complex relationship between a troubled teenager and her psychiatrist, with much of the story told in what seem like transcripts of analytic sessions.         Ms. Rossner's vivid imagination is suggested by the circumstances of the young analysand: Dawn Henley was raised by a lesbian aunt and her lover after Dawn's mother killed herself and her homosexual father drowned in a boating accident. Her foster parents have since separated.         Other fanciful plots include a woman who falls in love with a young man who turns out to be her illegitimate son in ''Emmeline'' (1980), and conjoined twins who marry two women in ''Attachments'' (1977), with the curiosity-inspiring sexual gymnastics hardly ignored.         John Leonard in The New York Times called ''Attachments'' an ''ambitious, disturbing novel by a best-selling author who might have written a trashy book, but decided instead to mess up our minds.''         Judith Perelman was born in Manhattan on March 31, 1935, and grew up in the Bronx. Her father was a textile merchant and her mother a schoolteacher who nurtured her daughter's early interest in writing. At 19 she dropped out of the City College of New York to marry Robert Rossner, a teacher and writer whose name she kept after their divorce in 1972.         She later married and divorced Mordecai Persky. She is survived by her husband Stanley Leff; her children, Daniel and Jean Rossner; her sister, Nancy Pike; and three grandchildren.         Her first marriage broke up after an ill-fated move to a New Hampshire commune, and she returned to New York, where she supported her family with secretarial work, carving out time to write her first three novels. These included ''Any Minute I Can Split,'' finished just before her first divorce.         ''My abiding theme is separations,'' she said in an interview with The Washington Post in 1983.         Ms. Rossner became fascinated by the murder of Roseann Quinn, the 27-year-old schoolteacher killed after an encounter in a singles bar, and proposed an article for a special women's issue of Esquire magazine. Esquire's lawyers, fearing the article might jeopardize the accused man's defense, killed the story.         Ms. Rossner, who was recovering from a car accident, found herself pondering the extent to which people are to blame for their own misfortunes. She wrote a one-sentence proposal for a novel on the episode to Simon & Schuster. It read: ''I want to write a book about a schoolteacher who's murdered picking up someone when she's cruising a singles bar.''         According to some published reports, she received a $5,000 advance; others say $10,000. ''Mr. Goodbar'' was sold for $300,000 as a paperback and for $250,000 as a movie, making her financially independent.         Christopher Hawtree, writing in The Guardian of London in 1990, described the book's bleak theme: ''Some of the raunchiest sex scenes ever written lead to a despair that makes death almost inevitable, perhaps even sought.''         Ms. Rossner's other books included ''To the Precipice'' (1966), ''Nine Months in the Life of an Old Maid'' (1969), ''His Little Women'' (1990), ''Olivia'' (1994) and ''Perfidia'' (1997).         Her works repeatedly explored but never explained what she considered an unsettling quandary.         ''It's astonishing what some women will put up with just to have a warm body -- some of the brightest women I know are obsessed with that search,'' she told The Washington Post. ''It's very sad.''       
         Ernesta Drinker Ballard, who saved the Philadelphia Flower Show and transformed it from a horticultural beauty show into a spectacular international educational event, died Aug. 11 at the Cathedral Village retirement community in Philadelphia. She was 85 and formerly lived in the Chestnut Hill area of Philadelphia.         The cause was complications of a stroke, her family said.         For 18 years, from 1963 to 1981, she was the executive director of the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society. Early in that period, the society's annual flower show, which began in 1829 and eventually grew into the largest indoor flower show in the United States was faltering, and a two-year suspension was discussed. Mrs. Ballard argued that a suspension might be fatal and instead changed the content of the show, bringing it to international prominence.         An exhibitor herself, she directed the show for 17 years, until 1981. She opened it to amateur growers and used it as a teaching laboratory for a wider public. Last year's show covered more than 30 acres with flower, garden and landscape displays and competitions, and lectures, workshops and cooking demonstrations. It drew more than a quarter million visitors.         Under Mrs. Ballard's guidance, the event began to produce a financial surplus, which she used to start the Horticultural Society's community gardening program, Philadelphia Green. That program, which turns vacant lots into vegetable gardens and flower beds, became one of the largest such urban greening projects in the nation.         Mrs. Ballard also played a leading role in saving public monuments like the Swann Fountain on Logan Circle and restoring the buildings and grounds of Philadelphia's historic Fairmount Waterworks. She was a Fairmount Park commissioner for 21 years, until 2002.         Ernesta Drinker was born into a distinguished Philadelphia family, a daughter of a prominent lawyer, Harry Drinker, and Sophie Hutcheson Drinker, a feminist and author. She was not encouraged to attend college but graduated as an adult from the Pennsylvania School of Horticulture for Women (now part of Temple University) in 1954, when she started her own greenhouse business.         Mrs. Ballard was also known as the ''godmother of Philadelphia feminism.'' She was a founder of local chapters of groups like the National Organization for Women and campaigned for the Equal Rights Amendment and abortion rights.         ''The Feminine Mystique'' (1963) by Betty Friedan propelled Mrs. Ballard toward feminism, and it was Ms. Friedan who invited her to start the NOW chapter. She was also a co-founder of Women's Way, a seminal Philadelphia fund-raising group that supports an array of women's organizations and causes.         Mrs. Ballard's husband, Frederic, a prominent lawyer and former president of the American Bonsai Association, died in 2001. She is survived by their son, Frederic L. Jr., of Bethesda, Md.; three daughters, Alice W. Ballard of Philadelphia, Sophie B. Bilezikian of Scarsdale, N.Y., and Ernesta Ballard of Ketchikan, Alaska; a sister, Cecilia D. Saltonstall of Exeter, N.H.; a brother, Henry Drinker of Bedford, Mass.; eight grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Nora Kerr, a longtime editor at The New York Times and a former editor of its Sunday Travel section, died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 61 and a Manhattan resident.         Ms. Kerr, who retired from the paper this month, died after having been ill with cancer for some years, her husband, Gordy Thompson, said.         Ms. Kerr joined The Times in 1976 as a copy editor; she was later editor of the paper's Westchester Weekly section and an assistant metropolitan editor. She was editor of the Travel section from 1986 to 1989, and was afterward an editor in The Times Magazine and the Arts & Leisure and Culture sections.         Nora Kerr was born on Nov. 19, 1943, in Cairo, where her parents had met during the war; the family later moved to New Jersey. She attended William Paterson College and Rutgers University and from 1967 to 1976 was a reporter and editor at The Bergen Record.         Ms. Kerr's first marriage ended in divorce. In addition to Mr. Thompson, a retired manager of Internet services at The Times, Ms. Kerr is survived by their son, Andrew Kerr-Thompson; her mother, Hermine, of Wayne, N.J.; and a sister, Jacqueline Kerr Harrold, of Benton, Pa.       
         Dr. Margot S. Kruskall, a Harvard hematologist and an expert on blood banks who was an early advocate for patients' donations of their own blood before surgery, a practice propelled by the spread of AIDS in the 1980's, died on Aug. 27 at her home in Dover, Mass. She was 56. The cause was ovarian cancer, her family said.         In 1982, when Dr. Kruskall headed Beth Israel Hospital's blood bank and hematology laboratory in Boston, she established a program for patients to donate and store their own blood, in large part stemming from concerns about hepatitis infections.         The practice, known as autologous donation, was known for more than a century, although it had never before been instituted on a wide scale. Dr. Kruskall and others at Beth Israel set up a system to label the blood, decided what surgical procedures were best served by it and created an inventory system.         The program's timing was propitious, coming just as H.I.V. was being recognized as a blood-borne virus.         When similar programs appeared nationwide, Dr. Kruskall and others analyzed their effectiveness and published the findings in the journal Transfusion in 1986. Autologous donations have since declined, largely because of closer controls on blood banks and the application of the hormone erythropoietin, which stimulates production of red blood cells and markedly reduces the need for blood transfusions.         Dr. Justine M. Carr, a hematologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and a former director of the hematology lab there, said Dr. Kruskall began to research the viability of erythropoietin in the 1980's, helping to prove its effectiveness and determine dosages.         She and other scientists later developed a blood test to detect erythropoietin, which has been used by athletes to reduce muscle fatigue and illicitly enhance performance.         More recently, Dr. Kruskall pursued research to develop a kind of universal red blood cell that could be safely infused, regardless of a patient's blood type. She worked with Type B blood, modifying its red cells with enzymes to react like the cells in blood Type O, which can be received by most patients.         Margot Sheffield Kruskall was born in New York City. She earned an undergraduate degree from Jackson College of Tufts University, and her medical degree from the Medical College of Wisconsin in 1974.         She arrived at Beth Israel in 1976 and remained for the rest of her career, ultimately serving as director of the division of laboratory and transfusion medicine. Harvard appointed her an associate professor of medicine in 1992 and a professor of pathology in 2002.         Dr. Kruskall was an associate editor of Transfusion.         She is survived by her husband of 32 years, Dr. Stephen Kruskall, co-chairman of the emergency room at MetroWest Medical Center in Framingham, Mass.; a son, Peter; two daughters, Gillian and Lauren, all of Dover; and by a sister, Denni Day of Rochester.       
         Ruth Farbman, an aide to Mayor Robert F. Wagner who was prominent in New York City civic affairs during the 1950's and 60's, died on Sept. 2 in Manhattan. She was 92.         Ms. Farbman's daughter-in-law, Marie Farbman, confirmed the death.         During the Wagner administration, 1954-65, Ms. Farbman directed the mayor's correspondence office, cataloguing and analyzing the thousands of letters that poured in each month on a bewildering variety of issues. She was also executive secretary of the city Department of Labor and later held executive posts with the city's Community Mental Health Board.         Ms. Farbman was previously known for her work with the United Parents Associations, a group concerned with educational issues; she was its president from 1950 to 1952.         Ruth Rubin was born in Pittsburgh on May 25, 1913. In 1933 she married Leonard X. Farbman. He survives her, along with a sister, Florence Horn, of Salisbury, Md.; a son, David, of Kinnelon, N.J.; and two grandchildren.       
         Sandra Feldman, the blunt-spoken former president of the American Federation of Teachers and its local in New York, who emerged from the shadow of her mentor, Albert Shanker, to become a deft and intimidating labor powerhouse on her own, died Sunday night at her home in Manhattan. She was 65.         Alex Wohl, a spokesman for the national union, which Ms. Feldman led from 1997 to 2004, said the cause was breast cancer, which recurred last year and deterred Ms. Feldman from seeking re-election.         A scrappy fighter who rarely minced words, the Brooklyn-born Ms. Feldman took on mayors, school chancellors and American presidents with the same inattention to ceremony with which she dispatched rivals for her union leadership.         As head of the American Federation of Teachers, the nation's second-largest union, with 1.3 million members, she was an impassioned advocate for the public schools that educated her. She worked with members of the Bush administration and members of Congress to write the education law known as No Child Left Behind, which imposed stricter performance standards on all schools receiving federal aid. But she was not timid about assailing President Bush when she thought he was not funneling enough resources to sustain those standards.         She put the power of the United Federation of Teachers, the New York local, with 110,000 members at the time, behind the election of David N. Dinkins as mayor in 1989, an effort that helped him garner white votes. But when he disappointed her by letting a year pass without a new contract, she publicly let him know. ''I feel angry at him,'' she said, and added, ''The mayor had better understand that I'd fight him to the end for the needs of my members.''         At one point in the late 1980's, she fought so ardently for Bernard Gifford to become New York City schools chancellor that Robert F. Wagner Jr., the president of the Board of Education, threatened to resign unless Ms. Feldman backed off.         ''She is part shop steward, part visionary,'' Mr. Wagner said in a comment at the time that seemed to capture her earthy charm.         Yet, even as she could be fierce in fighting battles like smaller class sizes, she had an artful touch in private dealings over the brass-tacks issues of pensions and benefits and often veiled her thoughts.         Randi Weingarten, who succeeded Ms. Feldman as president of the United Federation of Teachers, said, ''People remember her take-no-prisoners kind of attitude, but Sandy was far more pragmatic than people give her credit for.'' She recalled how in 1991 the Dinkins administration planned to lay off 4,000 paraprofessionals, and to save those jobs Ms. Feldman agreed to defer a $40 million portion of a 5 1/2 percent wage increase she had negotiated not long before. ''She was courageous in explaining the difficulties to her members,'' Ms. Weingarten said.         The person to whom she was most wedded in the public eye was Mr. Shanker, who built a rudderless collection of local unions into the United Federation of Teachers, which came to have perhaps the most powerful voice in who would become chancellor. As a 29-year-old union field representative, she was often at Mr. Shanker's side in 1968 when he locked horns with an experimental, largely black community school district in Ocean Hill-Brownsville, Brooklyn, that tried to transfer 13 white, mostly Jewish teachers and administrators.         The conflict was fraught with charges of anti-Semitism and racism, and Ms. Feldman was in a difficult position, having been an advocate for civil rights, working to integrate Howard Johnson restaurants along Route 40 in Maryland. Her instincts were at first to avoid confrontation, Ms. Weingarten recalled.         Although the battle culminated in legislation creating a diluted version of community control in a decentralized school system, the union, by going on strike three times, had proved it could shut down the schools at will and, in a fragmented system, it emerged more powerful than ever with increased job protections for its members.         Hardened in that caldron, Ms. Feldman became the union's secretary and took over its presidency in 1986, when Mr. Shanker became head of the national union. She battled chancellors and mayors for significantly higher pay and improved working conditions for her members.         ''Having lived through the contentious teachers' strikes of the late 1960's, she was wary of any effort to remove due process protections from her membership,'' said Diane Ravitch, the education scholar.         Detractors in government said she sometimes protected teachers' rights at the expense of students, by, for example, winning concessions that put aides rather than teachers in charge of discipline in hallways and cafeterias. Critics also pointed out that she never abandoned her insistence that the school system should not have the right to reassign seasoned teachers to failing schools, even if they were needed there most.         As head of the American Federation of Teachers, she worked to increase federal and state spending for programs for the youngest children in a program she called Kindergarten Plus. She also tried unsuccessfully to devise a merger with the largest national union, the National Education Association.         Ms. Feldman, whom almost everyone called Sandy, was born Sandra Abramowitz in Coney Island in October 1939, about six weeks after the outbreak of war in Europe. The daughter of a milkman and a sickly woman who worked part time in a bakery, she grew up in a tenement and later in a public housing project.         She went to James Madison High School and studied English at Brooklyn College, where she immersed herself in socialist politics and civil rights activities. After her freshman year she married Paul Feldman, whom she met at the college literary magazine. They divorced 17 years later.         Her first full-time appointment was to Public School 34 on the Lower East Side, where she taught fourth grade for three years. ''When I came into that school, there was only one union member,'' she said. ''I organized it immediately.''         She loved to read fiction and sometimes went dancing in salsa and jazz clubs with her second husband, Arthur H. Barnes, senior vice president for external affairs of HIP Health Plan of New York.         Besides Mr. Barnes, she is survived by a brother, Larry Abramowitz of New York City; a sister, Helen Berliner of Wylie, Tex.; two stepchildren, David Barnes and Donna Marie Barnes; and two grandchildren.       
         Lea Nikel, an abstract painter who was one of Israel's most esteemed artists, died on Sept. 10 at her home in Moshav Kidron, Israel. She was 86.         The cause was cancer, her nephew Yehuda Bock said.         Ms. Nikel devoted a career of more than 50 years to a form of expressionistic abstraction sometimes called lyrical abstraction. Painting with a brusque, generous touch and favoring high-keyed colors, she created buoyant compositions consisting of rough-edged blocks of color and scribbly, calligraphic lines that together convey a sense of imaginative excitement and urgent sensuousness.         Ms. Nikel was born Lea Nikelsberg in Zhitomir, Ukraine, in 1918, and emigrated with her parents to British Mandatory Palestine in 1920. She began studying with the painter Chaim Gliksberg in Tel Aviv in 1935. A decade later, she studied with Yehezkel Streichman and Avigdor Stematsky, who started their own school because they thought Israeli art schools were too conservative.         Ms. Nikel lived and worked in Paris from 1950 to 1961. She had her first solo exhibition at Chemerinsky Art Gallery in Tel Aviv and her first solo show in Paris at Galerie Colette Allendy in 1957. In 1995, the Tel Aviv Museum of Art presented a career retrospective exhibition of her paintings.         From 1961 to 1977, Ms. Nikel led a peripatetic life. She lived on Macdougal Street in Greenwich Village for a year in the early 60's; in Rome for three years at the end of the 60's; and, from 1973 to 1977, at the Chelsea Hotel in New York. After that she remained in Israel.         Ms. Nikel was included in numerous international group exhibitions, including the Venice Biennale in 1964. In 1995 she received the Israel Prize for painting and in 1997 was made a Chevalier of Arts and Letters by the French minister of culture.         Ms. Nikel continued to paint until just a few days before her death, and it is a measure of the continued vitality of her late work that the Sommer Gallery in Tel Aviv, which specializes in young and emerging artists, mounted an exhibition of new works by her in 2002.         Ms. Nikel is survived by her husband, Sam Leiman; her daughter, Ziva Hanan; three grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren, all of Moshav Kidron; and a sister, Sara Bock, of Rockaway Beach, Queens.       
         Betty Leslie-Melville, who called herself ''a total giraffe junkie'' and proved it not only by helping save a giraffe breed from extinction, but also by living amid the animals in a home called Giraffe Manor, died on Sept. 23 at a hospice in Baltimore. She was 78.         The cause was complications of dementia, said her husband, Vice Adm. George Peabody Steele.         In the 1970's, Ms. Leslie-Melville helped snatch a patch of land near Nairobi, in Kenya, before developers could turn it into subdivisions, and she made it a sanctuary for the Rothschild giraffe, a subspecies.         The population, once around 120, is now 300 to 400 in Kenya, and perhaps 500 in all of Africa, partly because of her efforts and those of her husband at the time, Jock Leslie-Melville, who died in 1984. The couple helped save part of 18,000 acres as natural habitat. They also helped set up giraffe preserves in four national parks in Kenya.         Others of the resurgent population of Rothschild giraffes, which are characterized by white legs and five horns, live in the Giraffe Center surrounding Giraffe Manor, near Nairobi. The Leslie-Melvilles were among the earliest conservationists to raise a wild giraffe.         Ms. Leslie-Melville founded a conservation organization called the African Fund for Endangered Wildlife USA, and Mr. Leslie-Melville, a Kenyan citizen, started a separate branch for Kenya. They began the organization by bringing five giraffe babies to their own preserve.         Mr. and Ms. Leslie-Melville collaborated on about 10 books on conservation topics and opened their center to visits from tens of thousands of local schoolchildren; most of them had never seen many of their own country's threatened species.         Ms. Leslie-Melville made their home into an inn after Mr. Leslie-Melville died. Giraffes regularly poke their noses into the windows of upper-floor guest rooms. A double room with lunch now goes for $595 a night, and much of the revenue is used for the conservation of giraffes and other species, including the black rhinoceros and the African elephant. The inn is now run by Rick Anderson, Ms. Leslie-Melville's son from her first marriage, to Lloyd Anderson, which ended in divorce.         In addition to her husband and son, Ms. Leslie-Melville is survived by her daughter, Dancy Bruce Mills of Glen Arm, Md., and five grandchildren. Another son, McDonnell Marshall Bruce, died in 2004.         Betty McDonnell was born in Baltimore and eventually moved back there in the 1980's. She attended Johns Hopkins University, ran a nursery school with her sister and worked as a fashion model. She first went to Africa in 1958 to visit a friend who was a member of the White Sisters, a Roman Catholic religious order.         She fell in love with the continent. ''You go there, and it's like you're in a Technicolor world,'' she said in a 1994 profile of her in The Baltimore Sun. ''It's magic.''         She persuaded her second husband, Danny Bruce, to move to Kenya. He ran a nonhunting safari business; their marriage ended in divorce.         She then married Mr. Leslie-Melville, who had been raised in Africa and was the grandson of a Scottish earl. They bought the stone manor house that became the inn.         Their giraffe-centered vacations became a staple of travel writers, and visits by Mick Jagger and Jerry Hall, Marlon Brando, Brooke Shields and other celebrities hardly hurt. In a particularly imaginative stroke, the Leslie-Melvilles named a warthog that lived on their property Cronkite, after Walter Cronkite, the CBS news anchor, and wrote a book about the animal.         They were also adept at raising money through receptions and dinners, often inviting guests to come in formal or safari clothing, or some combination of the two.         At one such event, the couple were auctioned off as a maid and butler. The buyer ordered them to serve a dinner party at his home.         Mr. and Ms. Leslie-Melville went there expecting to prepare loin of lamb, only to discover that they had misunderstood their boss for the evening. The main course was loin of lion.         They protested mightily, but finally prepared the meal. They did not partake.       
         The Rev. Mother Benedict Duss, who in the late 1940's helped found the first monastery for cloistered Benedictine nuns in the United States but stepped down as its abbess in 1995 amid a Vatican investigation into charges that it was being run in an authoritarian, cultlike manner, died Oct. 2 at the Abbey of Regina Laudis in Bethlehem, Conn. She was 94.         The death was confirmed by Sister Angèle Arbib, a spokeswoman for the abbey. At her death, Mother Benedict was abbess emerita there.         An American who trained as a surgeon in France before World War II, Mother Benedict helped found the abbey in 1947. Situated on 400 acres, it is home to a contemplative community of 37 women who farm, run a dairy and practice traditional crafts like weaving, bookbinding and ironworking.         The community, whose name is Latin for Queen of Praise, follows the Benedictine principles of prayer, hospitality and stewardship of the land. It is also famous for perpetuating the sacred tradition of Gregorian chant, which the women of Regina Laudis sing seven times daily and once each night. The abbey has released two recordings on compact disc, ''Women in Chant'' (1996) and ''Recordáre'' (2000), and a textbook, ''A Gregorian Chant Master Class'' (2002).         Mother Benedict's efforts to start the abbey inspired a popular Hollywood movie, ''Come to the Stable'' (1949). With a script by Clare Boothe Luce, the film stars Loretta Young and Celeste Holm as two young nuns trying to build a children's hospital.         Mother Benedict was born Vera Duss on Nov. 21, 1910, in Pittsburgh. When she was 3, she and her brother moved with their mother to France. In 1936, she earned a medical degree from the University of Paris. That year, she entered Notre Dame de Jouarre, a Benedictine abbey outside Paris, taking the name Sister Benedict.         During the war, she quietly continued her work as a community doctor. With Nazi officers occupying the abbey, she spent days living in near seclusion in its bell tower to escape their notice. After Allied forces liberated the abbey in August 1944, she resolved to start a Benedictine community in the United States. In 1946, she arrived in New York with Mother Mary Aline Trilles de Warren, a French nun.         The women started the Regina Laudis monastery in an abandoned factory on land donated by a Connecticut industrialist. In 1976, the Vatican elevated the monastery to an abbey; Mother Benedict was named its first abbess.         In the early 1990's, the Vatican began investigating accusations that Mother Benedict and the Rev. Francis J. Prokes, a longtime spiritual adviser to Regina Laudis, were running the abbey in a manner some critics described as cultlike.         The abbey made no public comment on the charges at the time and, through Sister Angèle, declined to comment last week.         In 1994, Father Prokes was removed as the community's spiritual adviser. ''That was a discernment of Rome, and this community has the greatest respect for that discernment,'' Sister Angèle said in a telephone interview last week.         The next year, Mother Benedict stepped down from the day-to-day administration of the abbey, becoming abbess emerita, Sister Angèle said.         Mother Benedict, who continued to live at the abbey until her death, leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Vivian Malone Jones, who on a blisteringly hot June day in 1963 became one of two black students to enroll at the University of Alabama after first being barred at the door by the defiant governor, George C. Wallace, died yesterday in Atlanta. She was 63.         The cause was a stroke, her sister Sharon Malone told The Associated Press.         Her entrance to the university came as the civil rights struggle raged across the South. On June 12, the day after Ms. Jones and James Hood were escorted into the university by federalized National Guard troops, the civil rights leader Medgar Evers was shot to death in Jackson, Miss.         On May 30, 1965, Ms. Jones became the first black to graduate from the University of Alabama in its 134 years of existence, earning a degree in business management with a B-plus average.         The performance of Governor Wallace, who stood at the doorway of Foster Auditorium flanked by state troopers, fulfilled a campaign pledge stop integration at ''the schoolhouse door.''         But historians have written that his defiance was scripted and came with a promise to federal authorities that he would be brief and would soon comply.         At the time, The Tuscaloosa News wrote contemptuously that the governor ''squeezed every suspenseful moment of drama from the occasion.''         The students waited in a car, as Nicholas deB. Katzenbach, deputy attorney general of the United States, avoided a direct confrontation. He said to Mr. Wallace: ''From the outset, Governor, all of us have known that the final chapter of this history will be the admission of these students.''         Only after the federalized guard troops arrived, four and a half hours after Mr. Wallace's initial refusal, were the students admitted. Mr. Wallace read a second statement challenging the constitutionality of the court order, then briskly left.         The students entered Foster Hall, registered, went to their dormitories, ate in the cafeteria and experienced no further incidents that day.         The first African-American at the university, founded in 1831, was Autherine Lucy, who arrived in February 1956 to pursue a master's degree in library science. But after experiencing three days of threats Ms. Lucy was suspended, ostensibly for her own safety, and later expelled.         More than 35 years later, she earned a master's degree in elementary education at Alabama.         Mr. Hood left the university after two months, saying he wanted to avoid ''a complete mental and physical breakdown.'' He transferred to Wayne State University in Detroit and graduated with a bachelor's degree, having studied political science and police administration.         Mr. Hood. returned to the University of Alabama and earned a doctorate in higher education in 1997.         Vivian Juanita Malone grew up in Mobile, Ala., where she was a member of the National Honor Society in high school.         She earned a bachelor's degree at Alabama A&M, a predominantly black university, but it lost its accreditation. To get an accredited degree, she applied to the University of Alabama's School of Commerce and Business Administration and was admitted as a junior.         One night at midnight, someone knocked on her dormitory door and told her there was a bomb threat. No bomb materialized, but that November, there were three bomb blasts at the university, one of them four blocks from her dormitory.         After Mr. Evers was killed, Ms. Jones said she felt even more determined not to give up.         ''I decided not to show any fear and went to classes that day,'' she said in an interview with The Post Standard of Syracuse in 2004.         In the same interview, she said one of her strongest memories of Alabama was that she often smiled at white students, but got no response.         The university hired a driver for her, a student at Stillman College in Tuscaloosa named Mack Jones. They later married, and he became an obstetrician. He died last year.         Ms. Jones is survived by her son, Michael A. Jones; her daughter, Monica Jones Shareef; three brothers; four sisters; and two grandchildren.         After graduating from Alabama, Ms. Jones worked for the United States Justice Department in its civil rights division. She also worked at the Environmental Protection Agency as director of civil rights and urban affairs and director of environmental justice before retiring in 1996 to sell life insurance.         In 1996, former Governor Wallace presented the Lurleen B. Wallace Award for Courage, named for his late wife, to Ms. Jones. He told her that he made a mistake 33 years earlier and that he admired her. They discussed forgiveness.         In a speech to University of Alabama graduates in 2000, Ms. Jones suggested one lesson that might be taken from her historic experience: ''You must always be ready to seize the moment.''       
         Betty Lee Hunt, a longtime Broadway and nightclub publicist and producer, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 85.         The cause was non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, said her partner, Maria Pucci. Among the many shows Ms. Hunt publicized were the original Broadway productions of ''Sweet Charity'' and ''Grease.''         She was an associate producer of ''Torch Song Trilogy,'' Harvey Fierstein's groundbreaking play, which won the 1983 Tony Award for best drama and Mr. Fierstein a Tony for best actor. She also co-produced the successful 1986 Off Broadway musical ''Beehive.''         Her extensive personal client roster at various times included Lena Horne, George Shearing, Marian McPartland and Bobby Short, with whom she worked for 35 years.         Born Betty Lee Hurewitz in Brooklyn, Ms. Hunt graduated from Erasmus Hall and began her career as an assistant to Dorothy Ross, a New York publicist for nightclubs like Spivy's Roof, Le Martinique and Le Ruban Bleu. In her early 20's she became publicity director for the Music Corporation of America, then worked for several other companies before forming Betty Lee Hunt Associates in 1950, which represented ''House of Flowers'' and ''The Zoo Story,'' the first of four Edward Albee plays she publicized.         The business was renamed Hunt/Pucci Associates three years after Ms. Pucci joined the company. Among the many shows they represented were Beth Henley's ''Crimes of the Heart,'' Marsha Norman's '''Night, Mother,'' Michael Cristofer's ''Shadow Box,'' John Pielmeier's ''Agnes of God,'' ''Liza Minnelli at the Winter Garden'' and Peter Allen's ''Up in One.''         In addition to Ms. Pucci, Ms. Hunt is survived by a sister, Aileen, and a brother, Saul.       
         Ruth Clement Bond, an educator and civic leader who in the mid-1930's, in her first and only foray into quilt design, helped transform the American quilt from a utilitarian bedcovering into a work of avant-garde social commentary, died on Oct. 24 at her daughter's home in Manhattan. She was 101.         Her death was confirmed by her family.         Mrs. Bond was noted for a series of quilts known collectively as the T.V.A. quilts. Designed by her, the quilts were sewn in rural Alabama by the wives of African-American workers building dams there for the Tennessee Valley Authority. Visually arresting and contemporary-looking even today, the T.V.A. quilts are considered pivotal in the history of American quiltmaking.         While most quilts of the period were based on the traditional geometric and floral designs that had endured for more than a century, the T.V.A. quilts are dynamic works of modern art. Using solid-colored fabrics appliquéd onto stark backgrounds, they depict bold, stylized silhouettes of black people. With their jagged yet elegant lines, the figures have been compared to the paper cutouts of Matisse and to the work of the Harlem Renaissance painter Aaron Douglas.         Mrs. Bond, who had trained as an academic and did not know how to quilt, embarked on the project after her husband was sent to northern Alabama to supervise the black workers at the dam sites there. The Bonds lived for a time near the Wheeler Dam, in one of the segregated villages built for the workers and their families.         The women completed a half-dozen large quilts, all believed to have been made in 1934. Three are extant, as are several very small quilts, made as samples.         The T.V.A. quilts have been exhibited in New York at the Museum of Arts and Design, and elsewhere around the country. They are featured in several books, among them ''Soft Covers for Hard Times: Quiltmaking and the Great Depression'' (Rutledge Hill Press, 1990), by Merikay Waldvogel.         In later years, Mrs. Bond, whose husband joined the Foreign Service in 1944, taught at universities in Haiti, Liberia and Malawi and worked with women's and youth groups in Afghanistan, Tunisia and Sierra Leone. After returning to Washington in the 1960's, she served as president of the African-American Women's Association.         In 1978, Mrs. Bond was part of a fact-finding mission for the National Council of Negro Women that studied the role of women in Senegal, Togo and the Ivory Coast.         Ruth Elizabeth Clement was born in Louisville, Ky., on May 22, 1904, the fourth of seven children of a prominent black family. Her father, George, was a bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church. Her mother, the former Emma Williams, was, in 1946, the first black woman to be named American Mother of the Year.         Ruth received bachelor's and master's degrees in English literature from Northwestern University and was afterward the head of the English department at Kentucky State College.         In 1931, she married J. Max Bond and followed him to the University of Southern California, where he earned a doctorate in sociology. Mrs. Bond also started work on a Ph.D., but left after the birth of her first child. Mr. Bond later took a position with the T.V.A., becoming the highest-ranking black administrator there.         Mr. Bond died in 1991. Mrs. Bond is survived by their three children, Jane Clement Bond and J. Max Bond Jr., both of Manhattan, and George Clement Bond of Teaneck, N.J.; a sister, Emma Clement Walker, of Seattle; six grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.         When Mrs. Bond joined her husband in Alabama, she planned to finish her doctoral studies, but there was no local university at which she could enroll. So, while her husband trained the builders, she went to work with their wives in the makeshift villages along the Tennessee River.         Many of the workers were former sharecroppers, and the dam project gave them their first real income. Almost overnight, their wives were buying pianos for their parlors. But to Mrs. Bond's consternation, they were wallpapering those parlors with the pages of the Sears catalog.         ''These country women were buying things they didn't need, yet weren't fixing up their houses,'' she said in 1992, in an oral history for the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training.         Mrs. Bond started a home beautification program, helping the women make curtains from dyed feed sacks and rugs from cornhusks. Many of the women were expert quilters, and she began designing pictorial quilts that celebrated black Americans' expanded opportunities under the New Deal. Mrs. Bond cut the pattern pieces out of paper and chose the colors; the women pieced and quilted the cotton fabric.         One quilt depicts a man torn between an alluring woman, tantalizingly glimpsed at one edge of the image, and a solid government job, represented by an extended uniformed arm, at the other.         Another shows a black fist seeming to rise straight from the earth. The fist clutches a jagged red lightning bolt, symbolizing the T.V.A.'s promise of rural electrification.         The women called the quilt ''Black Power.''       
         Ruth M. Siems, a retired home economist whose best-known innovation will make its appearance, welcome or otherwise, in millions of homes tomorrow, died on Nov. 13 at her home in Newburgh, Ind. Ms. Siems, an inventor of Stove Top stuffing, was 74.         The cause was a heart attack, according to the Warrick County coroner's office in Boonville, Ind.         Ms. Siems (pronounced ''Seems'') spent more than three decades on the staff of General Foods, which introduced the Stove Top brand in 1972. Today, Kraft Foods, which now owns the brand, sells about 60 million boxes of it at Thanksgiving, a company spokeswoman said.         Prepared in five minutes on the stove or in the microwave, Stove Top stuffing comes in a range of flavors, including turkey, chicken, beef, cornbread and sourdough.         Comforting or campy, Stove Top stuffing is an enduring emblem of postwar convenience culture. Its early advertising tag line, ''Stuffing instead of potatoes?'' remains in the collective consciousness.         As Laura Shapiro, the author of ''Something From the Oven: Reinventing Dinner in 1950's America'' (Viking, 2004), said in a telephone interview yesterday:         ''Stove Top made it possible to have the stuffing without the turkey, probably something no cook would ever have dreamed of but people eating Thanksgiving dinner might well have thought of: 'Take away everything else; just leave me here with the stuffing!' It's kind of like eating the chocolate chips without the cookies.''         Stove Top's premise is threefold. First, it offers speed.         Second, it divorces the stuffing from the bird, sparing cooks the nasty business of having to root around in the clammy interior of an animal.         Third, it frees stuffing from the yoke of Thanksgiving; it can be cooked and eaten on a moment's notice any day of the year.         In 1975, General Foods was awarded United States Patent No. 3,870,803 for the product, generically called Instant Stuffing Mix. Ms. Siems is listed first among the inventors, followed by Anthony C. Capossela Jr., John F. Halligan and C. Robert Wyss.         The secret lay in the crumb size. If the dried bread crumb is too small, adding water to it makes a soggy mass; too large, and the result is gravel. In other words, as the patent explains, ''The nature of the cell structure and overall texture of the dried bread crumb employed in this invention is of great importance if a stuffing which will hydrate in a matter of minutes to the proper texture and mouthfeel is to be prepared.''         A member of the research and development staff at General Foods, Ms. Siems was instrumental, her sister Suzanne Porter said, in arriving at the precise crumb dimensions -- about the size of a pencil eraser.         Ruth Miriam Siems was born in Evansville, Ind., on Feb. 20, 1931. She earned an undergraduate degree in home economics from Purdue University in 1953, and after graduation took a job at the General Foods plant in Evansville, where she worked on flours and cake mixes. She moved to the company's technical center in Tarrytown, N.Y., not long afterward. Ms. Siems retired in 1985.         Besides Ms. Porter, of Copley, Ohio, Ms. Siems is survived by another sister, Rosemary Snyder, of Chicago; and a brother, David, of Milford, Mich.         As a mark of just how deeply inscribed on the American palate Ms. Siems's stuffing has become, there are several recipes, available on the Internet, that promise to reproduce the taste of Stove Top from scratch, using fresh ingredients.       
         Leona Nevler, a prominent book editor who 50 years ago helped secure the publication of a first novel set in an imaginary town called Peyton Place, died on Saturday at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. She was 79 and had homes in Manhattan and Westport, Conn.         The cause was a pulmonary embolism after surgery, her daughter, Ellen J. Silberman, said.         At her death, Ms. Nevler was a senior editor at Berkley Books, an imprint of the Penguin Group. For much of her career she was an executive at Fawcett Books.         Known primarily for publishing paperbacks, Ms. Nevler handled the work of many prominent writers, among them John Updike, Margaret Atwood, Jane Smiley, P. D. James, Dick Francis, James A. Michener, Jeffrey Archer, Amy Tan and Fannie Flagg.         Leona Joan Nevler was born in Lynn, Mass., and earned a bachelor's degree in English from Boston University in 1947.         Her first publishing job was with Little, Brown, followed, in the mid-1950's, by a stint as a manuscript reader for Lippincott. She joined Fawcett in 1955.         While reading for Lippincott, Ms. Nevler was sent the draft of a novel by a New Hampshire housewife named Grace Metalious. Originally titled ''The Tree and the Blossom,'' it chronicled the dark sexual underside of a picture-postcard New England town.         The book had far too much steam for Lippincott, as Ms. Nevler knew. She recommended it instead to Kathryn G. Messner, who ran Julian Messner, an independent publishing house in New York. Ms. Messner snapped it up, asking Ms. Nevler to help edit the manuscript as a freelance.         Published in 1956, ''Peyton Place'' went on to sell more than 10 million copies and spawn several movies and a television series. The title became a catchphrase for suburban dysfunction.         At Fawcett, Ms. Nevler helped start the Crest Books reprint line and held various editorial positions, eventually becoming vice president and publisher of Fawcett Books.         She left in 1981 and moved to Ballantine Books, which had acquired the Fawcett list.         She retired from Ballantine in 2001 as a senior vice president and editorial director.         Ms. Nevler's marriage to James H. Silberman ended in divorce. Besides her daughter, of Newton, Mass., she is survived by a son, Michael Silberman, of Montclair, N.J.; a sister, Alberta N. Grossman of Manhattan and Westport; and four grandchildren.       
         Margretta Madden Styles, a nursing educator who conceived and helped establish precise national standards for certifying nurses in pediatrics, cardiology and other medical specialties, died on Nov. 20 at her home in Clearwater, Fla. She was 75.         The cause was colon cancer, her family said.         It was in the 1970's that Dr. Styles and others began to press for stricter certification of nurses and a rational system to regulate them. She lectured and wrote on the subject in nursing journals, contributing articles on advanced nursing practices and ways to determine criteria for issuing sound credentials.         In the 1980's she helped found the American Nurses Credentialing Center, which now administers testing for more than 20 medical specialties and, said Catherine L. Gilliss, dean of the Duke University School of Nursing, ''helped to standardize across the nation just what to expect from your nurse.''         The center is the credentialing arm of the American Nurses Association, which represents 150,000 nurses and nurse specialists. Dr. Styles served as the association's president from 1986 to 1988.         Later in her career she studied the emerging importance of trained nurses in developing countries and, in 1993, was elected president of the International Council of Nurses.         She continued to write on certification and helped edit a popular anthology, ''On Nursing: A Literary Celebration'' (1993), which ''framed the art of healing, the pain of suffering, and was received as a gift to the profession,'' said Barbara A. Blakeney, the current president of the American Nurses Association.         Margretta Madden was born in Mount Union, Pa., and earned an undergraduate degree from Juniata College, a master's from Yale and a doctorate in education from the University of Florida.         She worked as a staff nurse in hospitals before becoming an associate professor of nursing at Duke in 1967. She was dean of nursing at the University of Texas at San Antonio; then at Wayne State University, in Detroit; and finally at the University of California, San Francisco.         Dr. Styles's husband of 47 years, the Rev. Douglas Styles, an Episcopal priest, died in 2002.         She is survived by two sons, Michael, of St. Petersburg, Fla., and Patrick, of Redmond, Wash.; a daughter, Megan Styles of Danville, Calif.; a brother, Joseph Madden of Indian Rocks, Fla.; a sister, Jane Rupp of St. Petersburg; and two grandchildren.
