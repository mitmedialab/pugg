         Former Representative Tillie Fowler, who despite being the most powerful woman in Congress did not run for re-election in 2000 to keep a promise to serve only four terms, died yesterday in Jacksonville, Fla. She was 62.         She had suffered a brain hemorrhage two days earlier, a family spokesman, Tom Alexander, told The Associated Press.         Ms. Fowler was vice chairwoman of the House Republican Conference and No.5 in the House leadership when she left Congress. Her steely intelligence earned her the nickname Steel Magnolia. A member of the House Armed Services Committee, she was known for her expertise on military matters, including vigorous efforts to retain armed services bases in her Florida district.         After leaving Congress in 2001 and joining a law firm, she continued her leadership role in military matters as chairwoman of both the commission that investigated sexual abuse accusations at the United States Air Force Academy and the Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee, which advises the secretary of defense.         Ms. Fowler was also on an independent panel that last year investigated the abuse of prisoners in Iraq, attributing the problem to a string of failures that led all the way up the chain of command to the Pentagon.         She was born on Dec. 23, 1942, in Milledgeville, Ga., where her father, Culver Kidd, owned a drug store. Mr. Kidd served for 44 years in the Georgia Legislature.         A photograph in Ms. Fowler's Congressional office showed her at age 7 playing on the desk of Gov. Herman Talmadge of Georgia. She recalled that she was arguing with him.         She earned a law degree from Emory University, where she also did her undergraduate work. She later worked as a Congressional aide and in the Nixon White House, in consumer affairs. In 1971, she moved to Jacksonville with her husband, Buck Fowler.         She threw herself into volunteer work, then used those contacts to run successfully for the Jacksonville City Council. Elected president of the Council, she had three members arrested in 1989, when they tried to walk out of a meeting, which would have prevented a quorum needed to pass the city budget.         In 1992, she ran for Congress, promising to serve no more than four terms. She received 57 percent of the vote and was unopposed in her next three races.         She got a seat on the Armed Services Committee and was elected co-chairwoman of the Freshman Republican Task Force on Reform. In her second term, she became a deputy whip for the Republicans. In late 1996, Speaker Newt Gingrich gave her and Representative Jane Harman, Democrat of California, the tough assignment of investigating sexual harassment in the Army.         In 1998, Ms. Fowler was elected vice chairwoman of the House Republican Conference on the vow that she would serve no longer than two years in the Republican leadership. She filed papers in 1999 to seek re-election, but later decided to keep her initial promise.         She is survived by her husband and her daughters, Tillie Anne, of Washington, and Elizabeth, of California.       
         Col. Mary A. Hallaren, who led the Women's Army Corps into the ranks of the regular military in 1948, died on Feb. 13 in McLean, Va. She was 97.         Her death was announced by the Women's Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, N.Y., which made her a member in 1996.         Colonel Hallaren commanded the first battalion of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps to serve in Europe, the largest unit of women to serve overseas in World War II. Shortly afterward the word auxiliary was dropped, making it the Women's Army Corps.         She returned from three years in Britain and France with several decorations, including the Bronze Star, the Legion of Merit and the Croix de Guerre of France. She was then among the officers who helped to overcome strong resistance and to persuade Congress to pass the Women's Armed Services Integration Act.         Signed into law in 1948, the act accepted women into the regular armed services for the first time in United States history. Colonel Hallaren was the first woman to be sworn in as an officer of the Regular Army outside its medical branch.         She was named director of the Women's Army Corps, Regular Army, which gave enlistees a chance to try for any noncombat position and provided for an initial peacetime strength of 18,000. But the rank of colonel was the highest Mary Hallaren attained even under the new system.         She directed the corps during the Korean War until 1953, then had other military assignments. She decided to retire from the military in 1960, well before the Women's Army Corps was finally dissolved and women were formally integrated into all the services in the 1970's without restrictions on rank.         ''The Greatest Generation,'' by Tom Brokaw (Random House, 1998), devoted much of a chapter to Mary Hallaren, who always said she was five feet tall and relied in her job on a no-nonsense presence and a voice that commanded attention.         ''She was called the 'Little Colonel' because of her diminutive stature,'' Mr. Brokaw wrote, ''but when it came to promoting a wider role for women in the military, she was a towering figure, a godmother to the women who continued to struggle to find their places in the male-dominated military establishment.''         After retiring, Colonel Hallaren helped organize Women in Community Service, an outgrowth of the civil rights and women's rights movements and the War Against Poverty of the 1960's. She became its first executive director in 1965 and oversaw its growth into a national organization, known as WICS.         Based in Alexandria, Va., WICS recruits women for the Job Corps and helps women in need with job placements and other services. Colonel Hallaren retired once again in 1978.         Mary Agnes Hallaren was born in Lowell, Mass., and studied there at State Teachers College. Certified as an instructor in remedial reading, she took courses in psychology and education at Harvard and Boston Universities.         She enlisted in the WAAC in 1942 and trained at Officer Candidate School in Fort Des Moines, Iowa. She served as an administrative officer stateside until, by then a captain, she was named commanding officer of the WAAC Separate Battalion in July 1943 and sailed for England and duty with the Eighth Air Force.         She became Air WAC staff director, in charge of WAC personnel assigned to both the Eighth and Ninth Air Forces, and was on duty during the V-1 and V-2 bombardments of London. In March 1945 she was named WAC director for the European Theater, commanding 6,000 members, the largest WAC contingent outside the United States.         Mary Hallaren was teaching junior high school when Pearl Harbor was attacked, and she instinctively followed her brothers to enlist.         ''To me there was no question that women should serve,'' she said later.         She had to stand on her toes to meet the height requirement for enlistment. As she recalled it, she was challenged by a doubtful recruiter but passed muster after she told him, ''You don't have to be six feet tall to have a brain that works.''       
         Moura Lympany, the colorful and elegant British concert pianist whose career lasted more than 65 years, died on March 28 in Menton, France. She was 88.         Her death was confirmed by her former French managers, Bureau de Concerts de Valmalete.         Ms. Lympany avoided specialization, yet she is often associated with Russian music, particularly Rachmaninoff (she was the first to record his complete Preludes) and Khachaturian. She gave Khachaturian's piano concerto its first performances outside the Soviet Union, touring with it in 1940.         She also championed British composers, like Alan Rawsthorne (whose piano concerto she played in Paris immediately after the liberation in World War II), Cyril Scott, Benjamin Dale and others.         Ms. Lympany was born Mary Gertrude Johnstone on Aug. 18, 1916, in Saltash, Cornwall, England. Her mother, who had been a governess in St. Petersburg, Russia, before marrying an army officer, was her first piano teacher, and sent her to school in a convent in Liège, Belgium, when she was 6, setting the tone for a nomadic and international life.         After a few years in Belgium, Ms. Lympany returned to London, where she heard a child prodigy play a concerto with the conductor Basil Cameron and asked her mother if she could do the same. She made her concerto debut under Cameron when she was 12, playing the Mendelssohn G-minor Concerto. It was Cameron who advised her to spice up her name a bit, so she replaced her first name with Moura, a Russian diminutive, and Lympany, a variant of her mother's maiden name.         She studied in Vienna with Paul Weingarten, then in London with Mathilde Verne and Tobias Matthay, who remained an important influence. In the first Liszt competition in Budapest in 1933, she took second place to Annie Fischer; in the 1938 Queen Elisabeth International Competition of Belgium she came in second to Emil Gilels. During World War II she became popular in Britain by performing in the National Gallery lunchtime concerts organized by Dame Myra Hess.         After the war she embarked on a major international career. She made her New York debut in 1948 at Town Hall; Noel Straus in The New York Times described her playing as having ''a refreshing and irresistible wholesomeness, a freedom from exaggerations, an impeccable taste, a sanity, and at the same time a definite individuality.''         In 1944 she married Colin Defries, a colonel, engineer and amateur pianist; they were divorced in 1950. In 1951 she married Bennet Korn, an American radio-advertising executive. She had two miscarriages before giving birth to a premature baby who lived less than two days. The second marriage ended in 1961. Ms. Lympany later had a double mastectomy and a difficult period in her career, but had a minor renaissance in the 1970's.         She lived in London, Monte Carlo and the French village Rasiguères in the Languedoc, where in 1981 she founded a festival ''of music and wine'' that ran through 1992. A passionate gardener, she also owned a vineyard. She wrote her autobiography in 1991.         She became somewhat infamous in Britain for her appearance on the popular radio program ''Desert Island Discs.'' When asked to choose which records she would take with her to a desert island, she selected her own recordings.         ''My records are damned good,'' she said.       
         Mo Mowlam, the earthy, straight-talking politician who as Britain's Northern Ireland secretary helped negotiate the Good Friday peace settlement in 1998, died Friday morning at a hospice in Canterbury, her family said. She was 55.         Unsteady on her feet at times as a result of radiotherapy treatments for a brain tumor discovered in 1997, Ms. Mowlam fell and hit her head two weeks ago, slipping into a coma from which she never recovered. She left instructions that she not be kept alive artificially if there was no hope of improvement, her family said, and doctors removed her artificial feeding tube earlier this week.         Ms. Mowlam, who retired from politics four years ago, was an unusually blunt and unusually popular member of Parliament. After the radiation treatments caused her hair to fall out, she regularly flung her wig off during negotiations and news conferences, complaining that it made her head itch.         ''I hate the bloody things and have to carry two around with me because I kept losing one,'' she once said.         During the 1998 Labor Party conference, Prime Minister Tony Blair referred to her as ''our Mo'' in passing during his keynote speech, only to have the audience unexpectedly give her a prolonged standing ovation. Although the prime minister joked about it, she later said she thought that he resented being upstaged and felt threatened by her popularity.         In any case, the two fell out politically. He removed her from her Northern Ireland post against her will in 1999, shuffling her to a less important job in the Cabinet Office, and she eventually quit politics, growing increasingly disillusioned with his New Labor government.         But as tributes poured in from across the political spectrum on Friday, the prime minister called Ms. Mowlam ''one of the shrewdest political minds I ever encountered'' and said she was ''great company, utterly irreverent, full of life and fun.''         ''It is no exaggeration to say she transformed the politics not just of Northern Ireland itself but crucially of relations between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom,'' he said, ''and it was this transformation that created the culture in which peacemaking could flourish.''         Marjorie Mowlam was born in 1949 and brought up in Coventry. She had a tough childhood -- her family was invariably short of money, and her father was an alcoholic. She came to politics late, at the age of 38, after working as a college lecturer.         She decided to run for Parliament just five days before the deadline to register as a candidate for the 1987 election and won a seat in Redcar, on the North Sea coast. Immensely charismatic, bawdy, unpretentious and funny, she became an integral part of Mr. Blair's rejuvenated Labor Party, helping lead it into power in the 1997 general election.         She was quickly made Northern Ireland secretary, with a mission to help effect a peace settlement for the warring province. She visited paramilitary prisoners at Maze Prison to win them over to the idea of peace.         But even as she worked hard to build good relations with Sinn Fein, the political arm of the Irish Republican Army, which wants Northern Ireland to become part of the Irish Republic, she alienated unionists, who want it to remain united with Britain and who accused her of being too sympathetic to the republican cause.         She complained that she was increasingly marginalized during the talks that eventually led to the peace agreement, saying she was no more than ''a tea lady.'' After she was removed from the Northern Ireland post, her criticism of the government grew louder. When she finally left politics, she said it had become ''harder and harder to defend what the Labor government is doing.''         In 2002 she published a memoir, ''Momentum,'' in which, among other things, she stated that Mr. Blair and Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the Exchequer, were not getting along.         She is survived by her husband, Jon Norton, and two stepchildren.         Her plain-spokenness extended to shouting and swearing at intransigent politicians from both sides in Northern Ireland, invariably men, and invariably tough combatants. She was once overhead saying to Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, ''Bloody well get on and do it; otherwise I'll head-butt you!''       
         Hermine Braunsteiner Ryan was a Queens homemaker in 1964 when The New York Times revealed her notorious past as a vicious Nazi death camp guard.         Nearly a decade later, she became the first United States citizen to be extradited for war crimes. She was sent to West Germany, where she was tried, convicted and sentenced to life in prison.         That was in 1981, and little has been written about her since, although a German newspaper took note of her release, for health reasons, in 1996.         It turns out that she died three years later, on April 19, 1999, at the age of 79.         Her death appears to have gone unrecorded by American newspapers and magazines, although it is noted on the Internet encyclopedia Wikipedia and in a footnote in a 2005 memoir, ''Omaha Blues,'' by Joseph Lelyveld, a former executive editor of The Times, who recounts his experience as the young reporter who knocked on the door of the Ryan home more than 40 years ago.         Official word of Mrs. Ryan's death came in recent weeks from the Simon Wiesenthal Center's office in Israel, in response to questions by another Times reporter who was researching an article on the former Maidanek death camp in Poland, where Mrs. Ryan was once assigned.         Efraim Zuroff, director of the Israeli center, said he believed the death had been noted in some German papers. He said he did not know the cause, but in 1996, when the German government pardoned her from her life sentence, she suffered from diabetes and had had a leg amputated.         Dr. Zuroff said Mrs. Ryan's extradition and conviction were among the few successful legal actions against Nazis in the United States before the Justice Department Office of Special Investigations was established in 1979.         At the time she was discovered, Mrs. Ryan was living as the wife of an electrical construction worker in Maspeth, where she was known for her scrupulous housecleaning and friendly manner. When she was fighting deportation in 1972, The Times quoted neighbors saying her gruesome past was impossible for them to believe.         Survivors of the Maidanek concentration and death camp, near Lublin, told of her whipping women to death, seizing children by the hair and throwing them on trucks to take them to the gas chamber, kicking away a stool to hang a young girl, and stomping old women to death with her jackboots, among other cruelties. Her nickname was the Stomping Mare.         In her five-and-a-half-year trial by a West German court, which ended in mid-1981, Mrs. Ryan was convicted of just two murders. The deaths of possible witnesses and fading memories may have weakened the prosecution's case on other counts. Also, rules limited convictions to individual crimes actually witnessed.         Hermine Braunsteiner was born in Vienna on July 16, 1919. Her father was a butcher and not involved in politics. She received a strict Roman Catholic education and first wanted to be a nurse.         She instead worked in a brewery and as a household servant before going to work at the Heinkel Aircraft Works in Berlin, where she adopted the Nazi ideology. She applied to work at the Ravensbrück women's concentration camp in part to get more pay, starting in 1939.         In October 1942, she was transferred to Maidanek and promoted to assistant warden. She became known for whipping women for not sewing on their prison numbers correctly.         In 1944 she was sent back to Ravensbrück to lead a work detail. She had risen to supervising warden when the Soviet Army approached the camp. She fled to Vienna before the Soviet soldiers liberated the camp on July 23, 1944.         In 1946, she was arrested in Austria and handed over to Allied authorities, who shuffled her between internment and prisoner-of-war camps. In 1949 Austrian authorities again arrested her, and this time tried her.         She was convicted of assassination, infanticide and manslaughter at Ravensbrück in 1941 and 1942. Maidanek was barely mentioned.         Mrs. Ryan was sentenced to three years in prison, but was released early, in 1950. The Austrian government promised not to charge her with any additional crimes and granted her amnesty.         She then worked at hotels and restaurants, and met Russell Ryan, described in various sources as an American soldier or an American construction worker in Germany. In 1958, they moved to Nova Scotia, marrying in October of that year.         In April 1959, they moved to Queens, and she became an American citizen in January 1963.         Simon Wiesenthal, the Nazi hunter, who died in September, wrote in ''Justice Not Vengeance'' (1989) that he was approached in January 1964 in the Cafe Royal in Tel Aviv by three survivors of Maidanek. They told him about the cruel guard called Kobyla, the Polish word for mare.         One of his aides went to Vienna and discovered from her friends that she was in Halifax. Mr. Wiesenthal learned from a friend in Toronto that she had moved to Queens and got the address. The Nazi hunter then told the Vienna correspondent of The Times this information.         Mr. Lelyveld, as a young reporter, was assigned to check out the tip, but wrote that he was not given a specific address. He knocked on many doors of Queens residents with the last name Ryan.         On July 14, 1964, Mr. Lelyveld wrote that Mrs. Ryan readily acknowledged that she was Hermine Braunsteiner of Maidanek. She protested that she had already been punished in Austria, and said she was sick in the infirmary for much of the time she was assigned to Maidanek. Her husband told the reporter that he did not know she was a prison guard until Mr. Lelyveld informed him.         ''This is the end of everything for me,'' Mrs. Ryan said.         In 1971, she was stripped of her citizenship because she had concealed her criminal conviction from American immigration authorities. Germany and Poland then applied for her extradition.         She feared going to Poland, but said she was agreeable to going to West Germany. In August 1973, Mrs. Ryan was expelled from the United States. Her trial in Düsseldorf began in November 1975. With the many witnesses and procedural delays, it did not end until mid-1981.         Mr. Lelyveld wrote that in prison, Mrs. Ryan refused to speak to other inmates and liked to sew dolls and soft toys. When she was released, she went to a nursing home in Bochum-Linden where her husband lived.         A German weekly, Süddeutsche Zeitung Magazin, wrote of the couple in 1996, saying he had been seen pushing her through the market in a wheelchair, and asking her if she would like a bouquet of flowers. She did not respond. He looked at his watch and pushed on. Nothing is known of him now.         Correction:  December 10, 2005, Saturday  An article on the obituary page on Dec. 2 about Hermine Braunsteiner Ryan, a Queens homemaker who had once been a Nazi death camp guard, referred incompletely to the coverage of her death, in 1999. Although her death appears to have gone unrecorded at the time in the United States, it was noted in passing by some newspapers -- including The Daily News and Newsday -- in their obituary coverage, in September, of Simon Wiesenthal, the Nazi hunter who tracked her down.       
         Constance Keene, a pianist and teacher whose recordings of the Romantic keyboard repertory were highly regarded, died on Dec. 24 at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 84, and lived in Manhattan.         Her death was announced by Debra Kinzler, the spokeswoman for the Manhattan School of Music, where Ms. Keene has taught since 1969. She also joined the school's board of trustees in 1997.         Ms. Keene maintained a fairly low-key performing career in recent years, but her influence as a teacher and occasional writer on keyboard topics for Clavier magazine was considerable. She was a juror at several major competitions, and in addition to her work at the Manhattan School, she gave master classes in Europe, Asia and South Africa.         Early in Ms. Keene's career, her playing was praised by Artur Rubinstein, who said that her recording of the Rachmaninoff Preludes left him ''completely flabbergasted by the fantastic sweep, color, tone and last but not least, by the incredible technique.'' When Rubinstein decided that his children were old enough to take piano lessons, he hired Ms. Keene as their teacher.         Ms. Keene was born in Brooklyn on Feb. 9, 1921, and began to play the piano when she was 4. She completed high school when she was 15 and never attended college or a conservatory. But in 1934, when she was 13, she became a student of Abram Chasins, the pianist, composer, writer and broadcaster. She and Chasins married in 1949, and performed and recorded together as a duo-piano team. Chasins died in 1987. Ms. Keene later married Milton Kean, who survives her.         In addition to her duet performances with Chasins, Ms. Keene pursued a solo career that was given a boost by her victory at the Naumburg Competition in 1943. She then spent the remaining years of World War II touring Army installations for the U.S.O. At one camp, in Mississippi, she played eight concerts in three days for 65,000 soldiers.         She undertook her first professional tour in 1945, and made headlines in 1946 when she substituted for Vladimir Horowitz at a recital for an audience of 4,000. In the several years that followed, she performed with the New York Philharmonic and the Philadelphia Orchestra, and toured with Benny Goodman, as the soloist in Gershwin's ''Rhapsody in Blue.''         Her recordings included works of Bach, Handel, Griffes, MacDowell, Schumann, Beethoven, Rachmaninoff and Chasins, as well as widely praised recent discs devoted to the complete sontatas of Hummel and Weber.
