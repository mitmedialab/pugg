         Tanaquil Le Clercq, one of the greatest of American ballerinas, who was George Balanchine's ideal muse and Jerome Robbins's happiest inspiration at the New York City Ballet in the 1940's and 1950's, died yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 71 and had homes in Manhattan; Weston, Conn.; and Windermere, Fla.         The cause was pneumonia, a spokesman for the New York City Ballet said.         In a tragic end to her performing career, the still-young ballerina contracted paralytic polio in 1956 while she was at the peak of her powers. At the time she was also married to Balanchine, his fourth wife. Her luminously elegant style, the freshness of her long-legged wit and her mysterious dramatic perfume had attracted an adoring public. The dance world went into shock.         Yet although she remained paralyzed below the waist, Ms. Le Clercq became a teacher at Dance Theater of Harlem, wrote two books and frequently attended dance performances. In 1998, City Ballet opened its 50th-anniversary season with a tribute to her as a charter member of the company and to her legendary status within it. Ms. Le Clercq acknowledged a tumultuous ovation at the New York State Theater from her wheelchair as Peter Martins, the company's artistic director, presented her with a bouquet.         The tribute included films of her performances and interviews. Robbins, who cast her as the sensuous girl in his ''Afternoon of a Faun,'' summed up her range. ''Tanny,'' he said, ''could do anything.''         With an elongated physique that she used with refinement or humor (Balanchine once cast her as a dragonfly), she epitomized the modernized look in classical dancing that Balanchine was promoting in the United States in the 1940's. As the first City Ballet ballerina personally trained since childhood by Balanchine, she was naturally identified with his major works and the roles he created for her in them. These ballets included ''Symphonie Concertante,'' ''Symphony in C,'' ''Bourree Fantasque,'' ''Western Symphony'' and ''La Valse,'' in which her doomed heroine danced herself to death with chilling fervor.         Nonetheless, she was equally unforgettable in the Robbins ballets and as the stunning white-faced allegorical figure of Sacred Love wafted high above the ground by a male retinue in ''Illuminations,'' which the British choreographer Fredrick Ashton choreographed for City Ballet in 1950. In 1949, she was also willing to experiment in Merce Cunningham's works in Europe.         Ms. Le Clercq was one of those singular dancers whose dramatic projection and brilliant technique could appeal simultaneously to a broad audience and a cultlike following of artists and writers.         She was born in Paris on Oct. 2, 1929. Her mother, Edith Whittemore, was American, and her father, Jacques Le Clercq, was a French poet and writer. Their daughter was named after an Etruscan queen and was 3 when the family moved to New York.         At 7, Ms. Le Clercq began studying with Mikhail Mordkin, the former star of the Bolshoi Ballet. In October 1941, she won a scholarship competition at the School of American Ballet, founded in 1934 by Balanchine, Lincoln Kirstein and others. Ms. Le Clercq also attended the French Lycee and the King-Coit School.         Although Balanchine and Kirstein had no permanent ballet company at this time, Balanchine cast her in 1945 in a student performance of ''Symphonie Concertante,'' a ballet to Mozart. After Kirstein and Balanchine founded Ballet Society in 1946, the precursor to City Ballet, she recreated her role as the second ballerina opposite Maria Tallchief, whom Balanchine had married in 1946.         As a 15-year-old in 1944, Ms. Le Clercq had also appeared in ''Resurgence,'' a short piece Balanchine created for a benefit for the March of Dimes. Balanchine portrayed an evil character, Polio, who caused Ms. Le Clercq to look paralyzed.         Balanchine would later refer to the event as an omen of the polio attack suffered by Ms. Le Clercq while she and Balanchine were on tour with City Ballet in Copenhagen. Her misfortune affected many deeply. Robbins wrote her every day during the first year of her illness.         Balanchine returned to choreography in 1957. But even in 1959, B. H. Haggin, a critic who was especially devoted to the ballerina, wrote that for some spectators, there was ''an aching feeling of loss over the absence of Le Clercq from the works in which they had watched the development of her extraordinary powers as a dancer and as a stage personality.''         Particularly amazing was that Ms. Le Clercq affected so many in a professional career that lasted only 10 years. She was not the only dancer who served as a muse to Balanchine or with whom he had a relationship. After his first wife, Tamara Geva, left him, he lived with the ballerina Alexandra Danilova and subsequently married Vera Zorina and Ms. Tallchief. He married Ms. Le Clercq in 1952, and they were divorced in 1969. There are no immediate survivors.         Ms. Le Clercq created 32 roles for Ballet Society and City Ballet. She danced the dynamic ''Choleric'' variation in the 1946 premiere of Balanchine's ''Four Temperaments.'' In 1949 she appeared in two pieces by Merce Cunningham (''Games and Trio'' and ''Amores'') in a Paris studio.         Kirstein saw her as ''the epitome of Balanchine's lyrically athletic American criterion.'' Repeatedly, she combined French elegance with American energy, as was obvious in her dance-hall girl in ''Western Symphony,'' which Balanchine set to cowpoke tunes in 1954. Strutting on toe and her needle-sharp long legs, she exhibited flair and flounce; vulgarity was anathema to her dancing.         Her work was colored, above all, by a mysterious individuality. Others succeeded her in ''La Valse,'' a neo-romantic work by Balanchine to Ravel. But few could exemplify her pathos and fragility as she threw her head back and plunged a hand into a long black glove.         In some ballets, she was irreplaceable. In ''The Concert'' (1956), Robbins's big comic hit, she was a daffy heroine who struck a serious note with a long introspective solo. Robbins dropped the solo after Ms. Le Clercq stopped dancing.       
         Beverley Peck Johnson, a noted voice teacher and a member of the faculty at the Juilliard School of Music since 1964, died on Saturday in Manhattan. She was 96.         Ms. Johnson was a highly trusted and notably successful voice teacher, as the long list of eminent singers who studied with her bears out. Among her students from Juilliard were Renee Fleming, Faith Esham, Anthony Dean Griffey and Robert White. The roster of singers who came to her studio for private coaching includes Renata Tebaldi, Anna Moffo, Evelyn Lear, Giorgio Tozzi, Mignon Dunn, Theodor Uppman and Phyllis Bryn-Julson. Though she provided solid grounding in basic vocal technique, Ms. Johnson was particularly valued by students for a keen ability to find individual solutions to their problems.         Many good voice teachers play the piano well enough to accompany their students in lessons, but Ms. Johnson was one of the few who worked periodically as a professional accompanist, playing for, among others, Martha Atwood and Sigurd Nilssen. Several of her students became prominent accompanists and voice coaches, including Margot Garrett, Brian Zeger and Ken Noda.         Ms. Johnson, who kept her age secret from friends and colleagues, was born in Portland, Ore., on June 12, 1904, to Hartwig O. and Cecilia W. Peck. When she was young, her family moved to Walla Walla, Wash., where she was brought up. She studied at the White Conservatory in Portland, where she pursued a double major in drama and speech. As a young woman she moved to New York and polished her skills as an accompanist in lessons with the conductor Andre Kostelanetz. Some years later she studied voice with the tenor Hardesty Johnson, whom she married and with whom she toured as an accompanist. Her husband died in 1952.         Ms. Johnson also served on the faculty of the School of Sacred Music, Union Theological Seminary (1960-65), and the Manhattan School of Music (1982-1989), and was an adjunct professor at the Conservatory of Music, Brooklyn College.         Given her background in drama, Ms. Johnson was sought out by several prominent actors for voice lessons and coaching, including Madeline Kahn, Kevin Klein, Constance Towers, Tammy Grimes and Blythe Danner. When, during his presidency, Lyndon B. Johnson was recuperating from surgery to remove some vocal nodules, Ms. Johnson was summoned to his ranch in Texas to serve as a post-operative speech coach.         Ms. Johnson has no immediate survivors. No photograph of her was discovered in her files at Juilliard or her New York apartment, friends said. Besides keeping her age a secret, Ms. Johnson adamantly refused to have her picture taken.       
         A tribute to Beverley Peck Johnson, a voice teacher and faculty member at the Juilliard School of Music, will take place on Monday at 5 p.m. at the Juilliard Theater, 155 West 65th Street, Manhattan. Ms. Johnson died on Jan. 20 at 96.         The memorial service, which is open to the public, is to include performances by the soprano Renée Fleming and the tenor Anthony Dean Griffey, who studied under Ms. Johnson, and the pianist Ken Noda, who worked in her studio. There will also be spoken tributes by faculty members from Juilliard, former students and associates.       
         Eleanor Lawrence, a flutist who played frequently in chamber music performances and with several orchestras in New York and who is credited with transforming a newsletter into an important resource for flutists, died on Jan. 16 at her home in Manhattan. She was 64.         The cause was brain cancer, said Nancy Toff, a flute historian and a former president of the National Flute Association.         Ms. Lawrence, who was also known by her married name, Eleanor Steindler, was born in Boston and grew up in Athens, Ohio, where her father, John C. Baker, was president of Ohio University. After completing her bachelor's degree at Radcliffe College, she studied the flute at the New England Conservatory with James Pappoutsakis, the principal flutist of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. She later studied with the flutist Marcel Moyse as well as with William Kincaid, the principal flutist of the Philadelphia Orchestra, and Harold Bennett, the principal flutist of the Metropolitan Opera orchestra.         When Ms. Lawrence moved to New York in the 1960's, she joined the American Symphony Orchestra and the Brooklyn Philharmonic and performed periodically with the New York Philharmonic and at the Metropolitan Opera. She also toured the United States as a recitalist. In 1969 she founded the Monomoy Chamber Ensemble, which played an annual summer series at the Monomoy Theater in Chatham, Mass. In recent years the ensemble performed as Monomoy Music and presented an annual series at Weill Recital Hall.         Ms. Lawrence had a broad repertory that included Ernst von Dohnanyi's Aria for Flute and Piano and Passacaglia for Solo Flute, both composed for her, and works by Hindemith, which she recorded for the Musical Heritage Society. One of her last projects was a reissue of Moyse's recordings, produced with the flutist William Bennett.         In addition to performing, Ms. Lawrence was an influential teacher at the Manhattan School of Music, and in master classes.         She was the president of the New York Flute Club for three nonconsecutive terms from 1973 to 1989. She edited The National Flute Association Newsletter, now The Flutist Quarterly, from the mid-1970's to the early 80's and expanded it from a concise information sheet to a publication that regularly included interviews with important flutists.         She is survived by her husband, Frank Steindler; a daughter, Catherine Steindler; a son, Frederick Steindler; and two sisters, Elizabeth Baker and Anne Baker, all of New York.       
         Kitty Buck, who with her husband, Otto, ran Cake Masters Bakery, an institution on the Upper West Side of Manhattan that made cakes for Liberace, President Kennedy and Elizabeth Taylor -- and for less famous families' celebrations -- for more than half a century, died on Jan. 9 in Oceanside, N.Y.         She was 93 and lived in Manhattan.         Cake Masters, which the Bucks founded and operated, was known by its slogan, ''where baking is an art.'' At its peak, there were 15 shops, 14 in Manhattan and one in Queens. Many of the stores were clustered within blocks of each other on Broadway, a reflection of a time before supermarkets when people walked to bakeries for their daily loaves.         The chain developed the concept of cake as extravaganza, and sold many creations to theatrical and film productions. When Michael Todd staged a Madison Square Garden celebration in 1957 for the first anniversary of his movie ''Around the World in 80 Days,'' Cake Masters delivered the cake, even as an elephant delivered Mr. Todd's wife, Miss Taylor.         Mrs. Buck was born Gussie Rubin on June 15, 1907, in Hurleyville, N.Y., in the Catskills and attended a one-room school, where the teacher demanded, ''What kind of name is Gussie?'' According to her grandson Michael Halio, the teacher then said, ''I'm going to call you Katherine.''         She immediately shortened her new name to Kitty, and in the 1930's, had it legally changed.         She grew up on a dairy farm near Bridgeville, also in the Catskills, her daughter Barbara Halio said. Her father opened a rooming house for summer tourists, which later became the Capitol Hotel. When the hotel burned down in the late 1920's, the family moved to the Bronx and settled down on Morris Avenue.         She got a job as a sales clerk in a Bronx bakery, where a co-worker introduced her to Otto, a young baker who had recently immigrated from Germany. They married in 1930. In 1937, they borrowed $500 from Kitty's sister, Muriel, for a down payment on the first Cake Masters, at Broadway and 84th Street. Eventually baking operations were centralized at the company's building on West 72nd Street, which opened in 1955, and the other locations were used as stores.         In 1959, Mr. Buck died at 52. Mrs. Buck resolved to carry on. ''This is my husband's sweat and blood,'' she said, according to family lore.         A woman running what was then often a man's business, Mrs. Buck pushed racks around the bakery floor, rode to the stores in the cabs of her trucks and dealt with unions daily. In a photograph of a food industry gathering at the Waldorf-Astoria in 1965, she was the only woman on the dais.         By herself, she more than kept up the bakery's style. In 1961, it was a Cake Masters technician who was sent to Washington to confect a huge cake for President John F. Kennedy's inaugural ball. In 1982, a Cake Masters cake towered over the first ''Night of 100 Stars'' at Radio City Music Hall. Often, one of its creations was part of the bridal display at Tiffany & Company.         Mrs. Buck was also admired for her personal style, with some likening her upswept hair, smoky voice and quick wit to those of Lauren Bacall, who bought her children's birthday cakes at Cake Masters.         The stores began to close as rents rose and customers began to bypass butchers and bakers for supermarkets. The last Cake Masters shop, on Third Avenue at 65th Street, closed in 1992. Mrs. Buck, then 85, retired.         In addition to her daughter Barbara, of Oceanside, and her sister, Muriel Merritt, of San Antonio, Mrs. Buck is survived by another daughter, Joan Buck of Manhattan; five grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.       
         A'Lelia Nelson, a librarian who was a former president of a famous early black enterprise, the Madame C. J. Walker Manufacturing Company, died Jan. 20 at her home in Manhattan. She was 82. The cause was pancreatic cancer.         Ms. Nelson was linked to the company's founder, Madame C. J. Walker, who was her father's boss. Walker became a legend in the early 20th century by rising from poverty to become a millionaire, the first black American woman to do so. Her hair-straightening method and line of beauty products were sold by thousands of sales agents.         After Walker died in 1919, her daughter A'Lelia Walker took over the company. Her life was extravagant, and she ran a salon in Harlem called the Dark Tower that attracted celebrities like Langston Hughes.         A'Lelia Nelson's father, Freeman B. Ransom, was the company's general manager and lawyer during the years A'Lelia Walker was president, and named his daughter for her when she was born on Aug. 14, 1918. Her mother, Nettie Cox Ransom, was a teacher.         Miss Ransom entered Talladega College in Alabama at 16. After graduation, she got a master's degree in library science from Columbia University, where she was the only black person in her year of the program, said one daughter, the writer Jill Nelson.         She worked for a year in Waco, Tex., as a school librarian. In 1942, she became acquisitions supervisor for the Library of Congress in Washington, where she met Stanley Earl Nelson, then a student at Howard University's dentistry school.         They married in 1948 and moved to New York City. Ms. Nelson became vice president of Walker Manufacturing. In 1953, she became president. Walker's will decreed that the president must always be a woman. But the company was by then in decline. It was sold in the 1980's.         In 1968, Ms. Nelson worked on the ''Harlem on My Mind'' exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         From 1969 to 1996, she was a librarian at the City College of New York, where she compiled ''Black Spectrum: Bibliography of Black Studies Holdings in Cohen Library.'' She also organized a writers' festival named for Langston Hughes.         She was divorced in the 1970's. She is survived by two daughters, Jill and Lynn Nelson of New York; two sons, Stanley Earl Nelson Jr. of New York and Ralph Lewis Nelson of Berkeley, Calif.; and five grandchildren.       
         Sonia Arova, a Bulgarian-born ballerina who became an international star and was an early partner of such great male dancers as Erik Bruhn and Rudolf Nureyev, died on Sunday in San Diego. She was 74.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, her family said.         Ms. Arova was the ballerina with whom Nureyev danced the ''Don Quixote'' pas de deux at his New York debut with Ruth Page's Chicago Opera Ballet on March 10, 1962, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. She and Bruhn first met in the mid-1940's in the Metropolitan Ballet, a short-lived but artistically enterprising London troupe.         Nureyev, Bruhn, Ms. Arova and the American ballerina Rosella Hightower joined forces to present sensationally successful programs together in Paris in 1962. Later that year, she was again Nureyev's ballerina as guest artist with the Royal Ballet in London.         A dancer of strong technique and dramatic projection, Ms. Arova was born Sonia Errio in Sofia, the Bulgarian capital, where she studied music as well as ballet, receiving her dance training at the school of the Sofia Opera Ballet. When her teachers recommended further study in Paris, she left Bulgaria at age 11 with her mother. Her father sold his stamp collection to pay for her Parisian classes.         With the outbreak of World War II, Ms. Arova's British piano teacher in Paris urged her to escape France. Disguised in male attire as the teacher's son, Ms. Arova was smuggled into England on a fishing boat in 1940. She never saw her father again but was eventually reunited with her mother and sister.         In England, she danced with International Ballet (1942), Ballet Rambert (1946) and, most notably, with Metropolitan Ballet (1947-48). Then she became a balletic globe-trotter.         Ms. Arova was first associated with Page in Paris in 1951 when she danced a leading role in ''Revenge,'' the popular choreographic adaptation of the opera ''Il Trovatore'' that Page created for Les Ballets des Champs Élysées. Later, she appeared with Page's own Chicago company.         She was guest artist with American Ballet Theater several times in the 1950's and 60's, dancing both classical and contemporary works. Reviewing her performance in 1956, John Martin of The New York Times said she had become ''a lovely and curiously individual dancer, especially where dramatic color and characterization are involved.''         She also danced with Col. W. de Basil's Ballets Russes, the Marquis de Cuevas Ballet, London Festival Ballet, the Komaki Ballet of Japan, the Australian Ballet and the National Ballet of Washington.         Ms. Arova became increasingly involved with company direction, often in association with Thor Sutowski, the American dancer and choreographer, whom she married in 1965. As director of the Norwegian National Ballet from 1966 to 1970, she introduced several ballets by George Balanchine into the repertory, produced the first complete Oslo versions of ''Swan Lake'' and ''La Sylphide'' and was knighted for her services by King Olaf V.         She became director of the San Diego Ballet in 1971. In 1977 she and Mr. Sutowski were named co-directors of the dance department at the Alabama School of Fine Arts, a state-run high school in Birmingham. Many dancers they trained joined the Birmingham-based Ballet South, which made its New York debut at Brooklyn College in 1996 with a ''Swan Lake,'' staged by Ms. Arova and Mr. Sutowski. Anna Kisselgoff of The Times praised it for allowing its young women to ''show off a brilliant clarity and detail in their footwork'' and ''dance with a pure classical style.''         Ms. Arova and Mr. Sutowski returned to San Diego in 1997, where they taught for both the San Diego Ballet and the California Ballet.         She is survived by her husband; a daughter, Ariane Sutowski of San Diego, and a sister, Jeanette Errio of Vence, France.       
         Inna Zubkovskaya, a leading ballerina in the Kirov Ballet when that Russian company first appeared in the West, died on Feb. 5 in St. Petersburg, Russia. She was 77.         The Kirov was at a peak but unfamiliar to ballet audiences throughout the world until 1961. Ms. Zubkovskaya led the troupe in its United States debut when she appeared in the dual role of Odette-Odile in ''Swan Lake'' at the Kirov's opening night on Sept. 11, 1961, at the Metropolitan Opera House.         The company had performed a few months earlier in Paris, where it was rocked by Rudolf Nureyev's defection but continued on to London for its British debut. The depth of dancing at that time proved that the company from St. Petersburg was dependent on no single star but had an array of distinguished ballerinas, a stunning corps and other male dancers of superstar caliber like Yuri Soloviev.         Ms. Zubkovskaya belonged to the heroic generation of Soviet dancers that was responsible for the Kirov's impact in the West and who was deeply admired at home. She was prominent in the London season, where she was praised for her range and the mix of sweep and bravura in her classical style. Writing from London, John Martin of The New York Times called her Odette ''beautifully lyrical, always with a dramatic tone beneath the surface.''         Ms. Zubkovskaya was born Inna Izraelyeva in Moscow, where she graduated in 1941 from the Bolshoi Ballet school. Invited to join the Kirov, she danced with that company until 1970, performing in the classics and the premieres of major Soviet ballets including Leonid Jakobson's version of ''Spartacus'' and Yuri Grigorovich's ''Legend of Love.'' She had continued to work as a teacher and coach until her death.         She was married twice to fellow dancers, first to Nikolai Zubkovsky and then to Sviatoslav Kuznetsov.       
         Dame Ninette de Valois, the founder of England's Royal Ballet and a major British choreographer, died yesterday at her home in London. She was 102.         With keen vision and unflagging energy, Dame Ninette guided one of the 20th century's greatest ballet companies.         It was under her directorship, from 1931 to 1963, that the troupe made its United States debut with Margot Fonteyn in 1949. As a choreographer, she experimented widely, yet regarded classical ballet as the basis for dance training. Her works often looked Expressionistic or grotesque, and she had dancers perform in bare feet as well as in toe shoes, but all were rooted in the academic ballet tradition and could be performed only by classical dancers.         Most of her best-known creations date from the 1930's. ''Job'' (1931) was inspired by William Blake's illustrations for the biblical story. ''Bar aux Folies-Bergère'' (1934) derived from the Manet painting of a Parisian nightspot. ''The Rake's Progress'' (1935) brought to life Hogarth's series of paintings showing a fashionable young man's decline into debauchery and madness. ''Checkmate'' (1937) was an allegorical chess game between love and death.         Despite her love of art as source material, Dame Ninette's ballets were more than living pictures. Theatrically vivid, they were also thoughtfully conceived. As early as 1928, Dancing Times, a British magazine, called her ''essentially a choreographer who thinks.''         When her death was announced by the Royal Ballet, Sir Anthony Dowell, the company's director, offered a tribute to Madam, as Dame Ninette was known to generations of dancers: ''Through her achievements she will remain a source of inspiration and encouragement as she has been throughout her life to so many of us as dancer, choreographer, director, teacher and mentor.''         The daughter of an English Army officer, she was born Edris Stannus in County Wicklow, Ireland, in 1898; her family moved to England when she was 10. She once recalled that as a girl, she was reserved, obstinate and ''capable of the sulks.'' Later in life, a medical examination revealed that she had survived undetected childhood polio.         She enjoyed ballroom dance classes, and her mother, who invented Ninette de Valois as a stage name, considered her talented. At age 12, she was sent to the Lila Field Academy, a London theatrical school. She danced in London productions and studied with some of the major teachers of the day, including Edouard Espinosa, Nicholas Legat and Enrico Cecchetti. When almost every British seaside resort boasted  a theater, she toured the country until, as she later joked, she felt as if she had ''danced the 'Dying Swan' on every pier in England.''         In 1923 she joined Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, remaining with it for three years.         Returning to London in 1926, Miss de Valois opened a school and began to build what eventually became a national ballet company. She was soon involved with three important theater groups: the Old Vic in London, the Festival Theater in Cambridge and the Abbey Theater in Dublin. For them, she staged dances in plays, taught classes and presented dance programs. At the Abbey she worked with William Butler Yeats on some of his plays that combined poetry and dance.         On May 5, 1931, her dancers from the Old Vic offered their first full program, and a company was born. Called the Vic-Wells Ballet (after the jointly managed Old Vic theater and the Sadler's Wells, where the company originally performed), the troupe became the Sadler's Wells Ballet when all its performances were at that theater. It kept that name in 1946 when it moved to the Royal Opera House and in 1949 when it made its New York debut.         After the company settled into the Royal Opera House, Miss de Valois  established a second company, the Sadler's Wells Theater Ballet, at Sadler's Wells. This troupe was reorganized in several forms over the years and was the forerunner of today's Birmingham Royal Ballet, a major British company.         The original London company was renamed the Royal Ballet when it received a royal charter in 1956. Dame Ninette, who was made a Dame of the British Empire in 1951, remained its director only until 1963. Yet, for the rest of her life she helped guide the policies of the company and its affiliated school.         Although she choreographed less as her administrative duties increased, she remained an esteemed choreographer. She also offered directorial advice at the founding of the Turkish State Ballet in 1947 and choreographed for it on occasion until 1966.         She was considered a strict disciplinarian in the classroom, yet she was a witty conversationalist and, during her stage career, excelled in comic roles. Dame Ninette also wrote poetry, although she seldom published it. However, in 1985 the Sadler's Wells Trust issued ''The Cycle,'' a volume of her poetry, with all proceeds from its sale going to the Sadler's Wells Development Appeal.         As she became frail in later years, Dame Ninette spent most of her time at home. She was frequently visited by dance colleagues and her choreography was revived to the acclaim of new audiences. In 1993 there were two successful revivals: ''Checkmate,'' produced by the Royal Ballet, and a triumphant staging of ''Job'' by the Birmingham Royal Ballet, which was danced in theaters and in Coventry Cathedral. Dame Ninette attended the opening performance of ''Job'' when the Birmingham company had a season at Covent Garden that July, and she and her ballet received an ovation.         In 1998, to celebrate Dame Ninette's 100th birthday, the Royal Ballet offered ''The Rake's Progress'' as part of a gala program that included excerpts from some of her other works, and the Birmingham Ballet revived ''The Prospect Before Us'' (1940), a comedy about the rivalry between two 18th-century theater managers.         Dame Ninette always kept her private and public lives separate. In ''Come Dance With Me,'' an autobiography published in 1957, she noted that she was married in 1935, but not once in the book did she mention her husband's name: Dr. Arthur Connell, a physician who died in 1987. She left no survivors.         Dame Ninette was awarded the French Legion of Honor in 1950, and received the Erasmus Prize (1974), the Society of West End Theaters' Special Award (1992), the Dance Magazine Award (1998) and honorary degrees from London (1947), Reading (1951), Oxford (1955), Aberdeen (1958) and Cambridge (1992) universities. In 1980 Queen Elizabeth II made her a member of the Companions of Honor, for those who have done ''conspicuous national service.''       
         Ann Sothern, a deft comedian and talented singer who was known as the Queen of the B's at Columbia and RKO, where she made 18 movies between 1934 and 1936, died on Thursday at her home in Ketchum, Idaho. She was 92.         Perhaps never the star she might have been, Ms. Sothern was nevertheless one of the shrewdest actresses around. Her astuteness would eventually lead to her ownership of two early television series, ''Private Secretary'' and ''The Ann Sothern Show.''         In 1938 Ms. Sothern ditched her blond ingénue image and stormed Hollywood's greatest studio, MGM, only to be stuck in a wildly successful series of 10 movies about a tough, scatterbrained, down-on-her-luck Brooklyn chorus girl with a heart of gold, Maisie Ravier.         ''Maisie'' (1939), which had been bought for Jean Harlow and then shelved when Harlow died, was an instant phenomenon. Letters addressed to ''Maisie, U.S.A.'' had no trouble being delivered. After ''Congo Maisie'' (1940), ''Gold Rush Maisie'' (1940), ''Ringside Maisie'' (1941) and ''Maisie Was a Lady'' (1941) and between ''Swing Shift Maisie'' (1943) and ''Undercover Maisie'' (1947), Ms. Sothern begged the studio head, Louis B. Mayer, to allow her to quit the series. Mr. Mayer always answered: ''No. Your movies pay for our mistakes.''         Through bad luck or fate, Ms. Sothern was never more than a minor star: ''a Hollywood princess,'' she once said, ''not a Hollywood queen.''         Joseph Mankiewicz, the Academy Award-winning director who cast Ms. Sothern in her best role, as the soap opera-writing wife of Kirk Douglas in ''A Letter to Three Wives'' (1949), said of her: ''Poor Annie. Annie was a damned good Broadway musical comedy actress.  She had the sexiest mouth any woman ever had. But, at Metro, poor Annie got stuck in the Sam Katz unit.  She never got the big break Gene Kelly and others did, of being with the Arthur Freed steamroller of talent.''         Ms. Sothern got a few chances to show off her her talent, her timing and her figure in MGM musicals, most notably ''Lady Be Good'' (1941) and in the Ethel Merman role in the film version of the Cole Porter musical comedy ''Panama Hattie'' (1942). And she got good reviews as a hard-boiled ex-waitress pressed into service as a nurse and doomed when the island of Bataan was conquered by the Japanese in the World War II drama ''Cry Havoc'' (1943). But it would be 35 years after ''Cry Havoc'' before she earned her sole Academy Award nomination.         In 1988, at the age of 79, she was nominated for an Oscar as best supporting actress for her performance as Lillian Gish's optimistic friend and neighbor in the 1987 drama of old age, ''The Whales of August.''         A few months before the nominations were announced, Ms. Sothern told an interviewer that her chances were dismal. ''I think Hollywood has been terrible to me,'' she said. ''Hollywood doesn't respond to a strong woman, not at all. I was too independent. How dare a woman be competitive or produce her own shows?''         Like her friend Lucille Ball, Ms. Sothern turned early to television. In  their B-movie days at RKO, the two actresses had cried on each other's  shoulders, with Ms. Sothern complaining that she got all the roles Katharine Hepburn did not want and Ms. Ball saying that she got all the parts Ms. Sothern did not want.         Ms. Sothern was savvy enough to produce ''Private Secretary,'' and to demand that the situation comedy be shot on film, to preserve it. As Susie McNamera, private secretary to a New York talent agent, Ms. Sothern became a heroine to secretaries all over America. The show alternated Sunday nights on CBS with ''The Jack Benny Show'' from February 1953 to September 1957.         When Ms. Sothern quarreled with the show's other producer over her right to take on movie roles, she left the series and sold her 104 episodes for well over $1 million. She immediately returned to CBS in ''The Ann Sothern Show'' as the assistant manager of a swanky New York hotel.  Lucille Ball, as Lucy Ricardo, was a guest star on the first episode, and Ms. Sothern returned the favor several times as the Countess Framboise on ''I Love Lucy.'' In 1989, 28 years after ''The Ann Sothern Show'' went off the air, the actress sold the rights to the cable channel Nickelodeon, where the show became an unexpected hit.         Ann Sothern was born Harriette Lake on Jan. 22, 1909, in Valley City, N.D., where her mother, a concert singer, was on tour. She was the eldest of the three daughters of Walter and Annette Yde-Lake. Of Danish stock, she was raised in Minnesota by her mother and grandmother after her father, a meat salesman and womanizer, deserted the family when she was 5.         At 16 she was named the outstanding high school composer in Minnesota and sent to Detroit to represent Minnesota in a national contest. She spent a year at the University of Washington before joining her mother, who was a singing teacher in Hollywood. When half a dozen bit parts in movies got her nowhere, she tried Broadway with somewhat more success.         Florenz Ziegfeld offered her a part in ''Smiles'' with Marilyn Miller, but the star considered the 20-year-old Ms. Sothern too much competition and had her fired after the Boston tryout. In 1931 she played the ingenue in ''Everybody's Welcome,'' the play that introduced the song ''As Time Goes By''; she then toured for seven months in the George S. Kaufman-Morrie Ryskind-Ira and George Gershwin musical ''Of Thee I Sing.''  After the tour ended she took over the same role on Broadway, replacing Lois Moran. And Hollywood noticed.         She was signed by Columbia Studios, which changed her name to Ann Sothern and her hair color from red to platinum blond. From ''Let's Fall in Love'' in 1933 through ''The Hell Cat,'' ''Blind Date'' and ''Kid Millions'' with Eddie Cantor in 1934, the Maurice Chevalier musical ''Folies-Bergère'' in 1935 and a dozen more lightweight but pleasant musicals and comedies, she bubbled and sang.         Married to the bandleader Rogert Pryor and living in a huge rented house in Beverly Hills, she decided she had had enough of B movies. ''I found a much smaller house in Hollywood,'' she recalled. ''We lived cautiously, not as extravagantly, for a year. I was just so sick of those pictures, I decided I wasn't going to do them anymore.''         After making seven movies in 1937, she was off the screen until 1939, when she returned with fourth billing in an A movie, MGM's ''Trade Winds,'' as Fredric March's manipulative secretary. When he saw ''Trade Winds,'' Walter Ruben, the producer of ''Maisie,'' refused to cast one of MGM's contract actresses as Maisie; he insisted on Ann Sothern for the role that would define her career for the next decade.         In 1950, with her MGM contract coming to an end, she collapsed on the ski slopes at Sun Valley, Idaho, with a near-fatal case of hepatitis and was in and out of hospitals for a year. She had divorced Pryor in 1942. In 1943 she married the actor Robert Sterling and had a daughter. That marriage also ended in divorce.         Her movie career was essentially over, too, although she had solid parts in Gore Vidal's satirical political drama, ''The Best Man,'' and the Olivia de Havilland thriller ''Lady in a Cage,'' both in 1964. In 1965 she played her most bizarre role, as the voice of the mother of Jerry Van Dyke reincarnated as a 1928 Porter automobile in the television series ''My Mother the Car.''         Like many former stars she turned eventually to summer stock and dinner theater, with disastrous results. In 1974 on a stage in Jacksonville, Fla., falling scenery broke her back and smashed the nerves in her legs. She finished the performance, held together with silver gaffer's tape.         Told she would probably never walk again, she refused to accept the diagnosis. Immensely athletic, she was a crack trap shooter and deep sea fisherman, and her MGM contract gave her three months off each winter to ski in Sun Valley. She never came to terms with what the accident had done to her body. But she did walk, with a cane that she used reluctantly and constantly misplaced. And, a decade after the accident, she moved out of Southern California to Ketchum, where she could see Dollar Mountain, which she used to ski, through the window of her house.         A different kind of accident brought her one more chance for glory. The producer of a television remake of ''A Letter to Three Wives'' thought it would be a great marketing ploy to get one of the original stars, Jeanne Crain or Ms. Sothern, to play a cameo role. Ms. Sothern's bit part let Lindsay Anderson, the director who would be making ''The Whales of August,'' know that Ms. Sothern was still alive.         Mr. Anderson had retained ''a memory of her charm'' from Ms. Sothern's early musicals. ''In a sense she was too good an actress to be a star,'' he said. ''Being a star requires elephantiasis of the ego.''         Ms. Sothern is survived by her  daughter, Tisha Sterling, an actress and designer; a sister, Sally Adams of Boise, Idaho; and a granddaughter.         Summing up her career after ''The Whales of August,'' Ms. Sothern shook her graying gold ringlets and said, ''I've done everything but play rodeos.''         Correction:  March 20, 2001, Tuesday  An obituary of the actress Ann Sothern on Saturday misidentified the distributor of ''Trade Winds,'' a 1938 film in which she played a supporting role. It was United Artists, not MGM.         Because of an editing error, the article also misidentified the television show on which she appeared as the Countess Framboise. It was ''The Lucy Show,'' not ''I Love Lucy.''       
         Beatrice Straight, a graceful and versatile actress who won both an Oscar and a Tony Award, died on Saturday in North Ridge, Calif. She was 86 and lived in Beverly Hills, Calif., for most of the last 10 years.         Because she came from a wealthy  family, the Whitneys (her mother was Dorothy Payne Whitney), she never had to act for a living but was dedicated to the art of theater. When she became successful, she continued to choose roles for their challenges rather than for their ability to further her career.         Onstage and in films, Ms. Straight projected an image that was dignified but with strong emotional undercurrents. She brought believability to whatever role she undertook, acting in classics as well as contemporary plays and movies.         In the original Broadway production of Arthur Miller's ''Crucible'' in 1953, she was the essence of Elizabeth Proctor. Reviewing the play in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson said that both Ms. Straight and her co-star, Arthur Kennedy, were superb, adding that in performance, she was ''reserved, detached, above and beyond the contention.'' That role earned her a Tony as best supporting actress.         In 1977 she won an Academy Award as best supporting actress for her performance in Sidney Lumet's ''Network'' as the wife William Holden's character spurns. The role was brief but noticeable, behind the dramatic fireworks, a familiar place for Ms. Straight.         She had a variety of roles in plays by Shakespeare, Shaw, Chekhov, Ibsen and Tennessee Williams. In 1982 she scored another film success in ''Poltergeist'' as a psychologist moonlighting as a parapsychologist.         Beatrice Whitney Straight was born in Old Westbury, N.Y. Her father, Willard Dickerman Straight, was a banker and former official in the State Department. She attended the Lincoln School in New York and Dartington Hall Community in Devonshire, England, a school founded by her mother and stepfather, Leonard Elmhirst.         She made her Broadway debut in 1935 in ''Bitter Oleander.'' After she persuaded Michael Chekhov, Chekhov's nephew, to join her in forming an acting school and company, the Dartington Hall Players in England, they brought the troupe to the United States, where she performed in Shakespeare. Then she continued on Broadway as Olivia in ''Twelfth Night,'' Emily Dickinson in ''Eastward in Eden'' and Lady Macduff in ''Macbeth,'' with Michael Redgrave.         In 1948 she succeeded Wendy Hiller as Catherine Sloper in the Broadway production of ''The Heiress,'' an adaptation of Henry James's ''Washington Square'' in which she played opposite Peter Cookson. After the run, she and Mr. Cookson married. It was a second marriage for both.         In 1950 Ms. Straight played the governess in ''The Innocents,'' an adaptation of James's ''Turn of the Screw'' produced by Mr. Cookson. In his Times review, Mr. Atkinson said that Ms. Straight acted ''with force, sensitivity and old-fashioned charm, in a style that Henry James would have been compelled to applaud.''         She continued to act on and off Broadway, playing opposite Richard Kiley in Robert Ardrey's ''Sing Me No Lullabies'' and opposite Van Heflin in the Broadway version of Rod Serling's television play ''Patterns.'' She also had the title role in Racine's ''Phèdre.''         In 1967 she was in ''Everything in the Garden,'' Edward Albee's adaptation of a play by Giles Cooper. In 1973 she played Mrs. Alving in a Roundabout Theater production of Ibsen's ''Ghosts'' and in 1979 was Gertrude to William Hurt's Hamlet at the Circle Repertory Company.         Among her many television appearances, she was Goneril to Orson Welles's King Lear in an abbreviated version of the play on ''Omnibus,'' and Rose Kennedy in ''Robert Kennedy and His Times.'' In 1986 she was in Mr. Lumet's film ''Power'' and in 1991 played Goldie Hawn's mother in ''Deceived.''         Throughout her life, Ms. Straight was also a producer and teacher. As a founder of Theater Incorporated, she was instrumental in bringing the Old Vic, with Laurence Olivier and Ralph Richardson, to the United States. In 1981 she helped revive Michael Chekhov's School of Theater in New York.         Ms. Straight's husband died in 1990. She is survived by her sons, Gary Cookson, an actor in New York, and Tony Cookson, a writer and director in Santa Monica, Calif.; two stepchildren, Peter Cookson Jr. of Irvington, N.Y., and Jane Coopland of Hawaii; a brother, Michael Straight of Chicago, a former deputy chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts; seven grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.         Despite her patrician background, Ms. Straight always regarded herself as a working actress. ''I may have been born in society,'' she once said, ''but I was never part of anything but theater.''       
         Barbara Krakauer, a violinist who played chamber music and taught in New York and for nearly 25 years in summer programs in Provence, France, died on Monday. She was 69 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was breast cancer, said her husband, Dr. William Krakauer.         Mrs. Krakauer was born in Brooklyn and studied the violin with William Jones at the Third Street Music School Settlement and with Ivan Galamian at the Juilliard School and at Meadowmount, a summer training program. She also studied chamber music at both Juilliard and the Mannes College of Music, and continued her musical studies on her own in France with Nadia Boulanger, Pierre Pasquier and Jean Pasquier.         Beginning in 1977, Mrs. Krakauer began teaching at a series of summer master classes that were overseen by the violinist Zino Francescatti in Aix-en-Provence. After leading classes under the sponsorship of René Garmy, a luthier in Aix, Mrs. Krakauer, her husband and Jeaneane Dowis, the pianist, founded their own summer music program in Vaison-la-Romaine, France. She also taught in the preparatory and extension divisions of Mannes.         Although she worked primarily as a teacher, Mrs. Krakauer performed as a member of the Alaria Chamber Ensemble and other groups, and in 1988, when she was 57, she presented a New York debut recital at Town Hall. The concert was devoted largely to 20th-century music, including works by Hindemith, Britten and Ursula Mamlok.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Krakauer is survived by a son, the clarinetist David Krakauer; a daughter, Lisa Schultz, of San Jose, Calif.; a brother, Dr. Theodore Lieberman of New York; and her mother, Jean H. Lieberman of Florida.       
         Rita Hunter, the British soprano famed especially for her performances as Brünnhilde and Norma, died last Sunday in Sydney, Australia. She was 67.         Possessed of an immense voice, forthright and ringing, Ms. Hunter in her prime, which coincided roughly with the 1970's, seemed ready to take over from Birgit Nilsson as the world's leading Wagnerian soprano. In 1975, when the two singers appeared together at the Metropolitan Opera in ''Die Walküre,'' Ms. Hunter as Brünnhilde and Ms. Nilsson switching from that role to Sieglinde, it was as if the bequeathing -- or the challenge -- were being staged.         But the process stalled. When Ms. Hunter began to have difficulty controlling her voice, her gifts of native ability and robust good sense were insufficient.         Rita Nellie Hunter was born on Aug. 15, 1933, in Wallasey, England, where her father was a boilermaker. She had singing lessons with Olive Lloyd and Harry Burgon, and appeared in ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' when she was 14. She also studied with Edwin Francis in Liverpool.         In 1954 she joined the chorus of the Sadler's Wells Opera, in London, and continued her training with Edward Renton. Three years later she joined the Carl Rosa Opera and married a colleague, the baritone John Darnley-Thomas. She found herself back in London when the Carl Rosa and Sadler's Wells companies merged in 1959, but before resuming her career, she won a scholarship that allowed her to study for six months with the great soprano Eva Turner.         After that she went to her husband's teacher, Redvers Llewellyn, and began to get important roles at Sadler's Wells, including Senta in ''The Flying Dutchman'' in 1964, her first Wagner. In 1968 she had a baby, but was soon preparing for the English National Opera's ''Ring,'' under the conductor Reginald Goodall.         That ''Ring,'' which began with ''Die Walküre'' in 1970 and was completed in 1973, was a triumph, thanks partly to Ms. Hunter's boldly sung and magnificent Brünnhilde. She went on to sing -- apart from her Met Brünnhilde in the spring of 1975 -- the title role in ''Norma'' in San Francisco in October that year and at the Met immediately after. Her other roles included Abigaille in ''Nabucco'' (New Orleans, 1978), Turandot (Welsh National Opera, 1979) and Leonora in ''Il Trovatore'' (Welsh National Opera, 1980). She also repeated her Brünnhilde in the Seattle ''Ring'' of 1980.         She was made a Commander of the British Empire in 1980.         In 1981 she signed a three-year contract with the Australian Opera, and sang Brünnhilde, Isolde, Donna Anna in ''Don Giovanni,'' Aida, the ''Trovatore'' Leonora, Norma, and Santuzza in ''Cavalleria Rusticana.'' She elected to remain in Australia, and, though she did rather little stage work after 1985, was much in demand for concerts and recitals in Australia, Britain and the United States. Her autobiography, ''Wait Till the Sun Shines, Nellie,'' came out in 1986.         Her husband died in 1994. She is survived by her daughter, Mairwyn.       
         Marie Jahoda, one of the world's foremost social psychologists and an emeritus professor at the University of Sussex, died on April 28 at her home in Keymer, in southeast England. Dr. Jahoda, who taught at New York University in the 1950's, was 94.         In a long career as a researcher, teacher and writer, Dr. Jahoda, known as Mitzi, examined social issues in the field well beyond the realm of dry statistics, and in her classes emphasized a humanistic approach and adherence to scientific rigor in social research.         In New York from 1949 to 1958, she was a professor of social psychology at N.Y.U. and was a founding director of its Research Center for Human Relations. She was the source of a steady stream of surveys and reports on the social fabric of the city and the country.         Her topics included anti-Semitism and ethnic and religious prejudice in the work place and in intergroup relations. In one report she found that opinion researchers must sometimes resort to biased questions to detect bias on the respondent's part.         ''People with prejudices,'' she concluded, ''seldom like to admit it.''         On behalf of the federal Public Health Service, she investigated the effect of conditions in a wartime boom town on the mental health of workers. For this, she documented overcrowded living quarters and a dearth of education, health and recreation centers.         She tackled the delicate issue of loyalty in the political atmosphere of the 1950's by studying the impact of federal security measures on government employees.         In 1954 she assessed the role of women in America and wrote that women seeking to combine marriage with a career need strong mental health and an ability to solve problems.         Her investigation of conformity in America in the 1950's found the issue to be oversimplified. There were several basic types of conformers, she said. The most common type she called drifters, people who willingly changed their beliefs because they lacked adequate knowledge of the arguments pro or con. Another category she characterized as people who had definite and unpopular beliefs that they kept to themselves for fear of the consequences of speaking out.         Born in Vienna, Marie Jahoda absorbed the teachings of Freud and Jung and received her doctorate at the University of Vienna. She gained early recognition with a sociological study conducted in Marienthal, near Vienna, with Hans Zeisel and her first husband, Paul Lazarsfeld.         Marienthal, an industrial district, was racked by unemployment in the 1920's and 1930's. Working unobtrusively, the researchers measured the psychological consequences. For Dr. Jahoda the project demonstrated that work met a basic need for most people, giving them personal worth, social coherence and structured time.         As a Social Democrat opposed to the Austrian government even before Hitler annexed the country, she was imprisoned in 1936 but managed to reach England. There her research took on topics like unemployment in the coal mines and the transition from the classroom to the work place.         She came to the United States after World War II and worked as a researcher for the American Jewish Committee and at Columbia University before moving to N.Y.U.         She returned to Britain in 1958 to marry Austen Albu, a Labor member of Parliament. She worked as a researcher and teacher at the University of Sussex from 1965.         Mr. Albu died in 1994. Dr. Jahoda is survived by a daughter from her first marriage, Lotte Bailyn of Belmont, Mass., a professor of management at M.I.T.; and two grandsons. Dr. Jahoda and Dr. Lazarsfeld divorced in the 1930's. He became a professor of sociology at Columbia University and died in 1976.         Correction:  May 18, 2001, Friday  An obituary on May 10 about Dr. Marie Jahoda, a social psychologist, omitted two survivors. They are a sister, Rosi Kuerti of Cleveland, and a brother, Fritz Jahoda of Concord, Mass.       
         Judith Moses, a television news producer and teacher who also worked to expose the abuses confronted by journalists working on dangerous assignments abroad, died at home in Manhattan on Saturday. She was 61 and lived in Manhattan and Kent, Conn.         The cause was liver cancer, her husband, Harry Moses, said.         Mrs. Moses was on the board of the Committee to Protect Journalists, a human rights organization in Manhattan that focuses on the rights of reporters overseas. She produced public affairs documentaries and news programs for numerous networks and film companies over a 25-year career in journalism.         Her most recent work included the U.S. News & World Report/Freedom Forum series ''World@Large,'' which is broadcast on WNET, Channel 13, in New York.         Mrs. Moses, a Fulbright scholar, was an adjunct professor of journalism at the New York University Graduate School of Journalism last year and had taught in 13 African countries since 1991 as part of the United States Information Agency's Visiting Scholars Program, her husband said. She also trained human rights monitors in recording violations on videotape.         Since 1989, Mrs. Moses had been a principal in the Mosaic Group, a media company she founded with her husband in 1985. A PBS series that she produced with the Children's Express News Magazine won Peabody and Emmy Awards. From 1979 to 1989, she was an investigative producer for ''20/20,'' the ABC News magazine.         Mrs. Moses was born in Charleston, W.Va., and graduated from Smith College in 1962. After studying on a Fulbright scholarship in Germany, she worked as a translator, then began her career in news as an associate producer at ABC News, her husband said.         In addition to her husband, a producer for ''60 Minutes II,'' she is survived by their daughter, Anne Moses, and a granddaughter, both of San Francisco.       
         Lyubov Sokolova, a Russian actress whose roles in more than 300 movies in the years after World War II shaped the image of the Soviet wife and mother, died on June 6 at her home in Moscow. She was 79.         The cause was a heart attack, according to the German newspaper Die Welt.         Die Welt said of Miss Sokolova that in the postwar years, ''None of her Russian women colleagues formed as she did the image of the woman -- which was also propagandistically polished up, to be sure.''         She was one of only three professional performers in the 1967 Soviet movie ''Asya's Happiness,'' set on a collective farm. One of her best-known films, it was shown at the New York Film Festival in 1988. She also appeared in a 1965 Soviet movie that has been shown under the English titles ''Workers' Quarters'' and ''Workers' Settlement.'' It was shown at the Locarno Film Festival last August.         After Miss Sokolova's death, The Moscow Times called her ''Soviet cinematography's ultimate strong woman with a hard life.'' Her final movie, made last year, is titled ''The Agonies of Love.''         There was also drama in her real life. During the Nazi siege of Leningrad in World War II, when she was working in a factory and also training to become a teacher, her first husband, Georgi Arapovsky, and her mother-in-law starved to death.         After the war, when she had begun acting in films, she married a prominent director, Georgi Daneliya. He left her for another woman after more than two decades of marriage. Their son died in 1985.         Lyubov Sergeyevna Sokolova was born in the industrial city of Ivanovo, 198 miles northeast of Moscow. Her mother sold fabrics in a store. Her father was a carpenter.         As a girl, she was a theater buff and performed in school plays. In 1948, she acted in her first movie, ''The Genuine Human Being.'' As an established actress with a kindly face and large, handsome eyes, she was so helpful to fledgling performers that she acquired the nickname Mama.       
         Frances R. Horwich, the amiable educator who engaged millions of preschoolers as the host of the pioneering children's program ''Ding Dong School'' in the 1950's, died yesterday. She was 93.         Ringing an old-fashioned school bell to start the show, she would look into the camera, warmly wish a good morning and ask, ''How are you today?'' She paused so that toddlers at home, watching a somewhat matronly figure in swept-back hair and wearing a wool jacket, could answer. And they often did, thanks to her kindly, conversational style.         Then, ''Miss Frances'' would tell stories or demonstrate activities, like making pipe-cleaner figures or clay models. She used inexpensive, familiar toys and interspersed her presentation with unobtrusive lessons:         ''Ask your mother where to play with it,'' for a homemade musical instrument.         ''Be sure your sleeves are rolled up,'' for a messier project.         The half-hour show ended with a five-minute summation of the material.         ''Ding Dong School'' began on a Chicago station, WNBQ, in 1952. It was so popular that after six weeks, NBC picked up the program, and soon it was seen in at least 36 cities, with viewership reaching three million. The program was broadcast live at 10 a.m. on weekdays for four years, going to WNET in New York in 1959.         ''Ding Dong School,'' directed and produced by Reinald Werrenrath Jr., was one of a series of high-quality, innovative broadcasts by WNBQ that became its own of golden age of television, said Jeff Kisseloff, a television historian.         Unlike many of the children's show hosts of the period, Ms. Horwich ''actually taught kids things,'' Mr. Kisseloff said. And rather than the ''high-tech, dazzly stuff'' of today, ''it was her sitting in front of a piano or a drawing table,'' he said.         ''The intent was to educate the kids plainly and straightforwardly,'' he said. ''The fact was that it worked. You didn't need all the bells and whistles to keep kids watching.''         Its daily competitors at the time were ''Captain Kangaroo'' on CBS and ''Mickey Mouse Theater'' on ABC. A few years later, the successors to ''Ding Dong School'' appeared: ''Sesame Street'' and ''Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood.''         In her era, a far simpler time when there was no Cartoon Network or hip, irony-tinged children's programs, Ms. Horwich won acclaim. She received a George Foster Peabody award in 1953.         ''She imbues in the youngsters a sense of friendliness, confidence and faith that is truly magical television,'' The New York Times television critic, Jack Gould, wrote that year. ''She is a teacher, yes, but she is also a very genuine friend of the tots who sit entranced before the receivers.''         When she began promoting the products of sponsors, however, Mr. Gould called the step ''heartbreaking.''         ''The program is too important in too many homes to be allowed to go astray through regrettable short-sightedness,'' he wrote.         In interviews, Ms. Horwich seemed better at saying what children's programming should not be.         ''I don't think a television program should make a child's life complicated,'' she said in a 1955 interview. ''It should not get him into trouble with his parents. Sometimes very innocently a television program teaches a child a trick that is not socially acceptable and, therefore, gets him into trouble. It is not socially acceptable to throw a pie at someone or to fill someone's hat with water,'' she added, perhaps a not-so-subtle jab at Bozo the Clown.         She also deplored the violence of Westerns and crime programs, though added that normal children could handle it.         What television should do is appeal to their interests, open ''new doors and windows'' of enlightenment and help children learn to be resourceful, Ms. Horwich said.         Frances Rappaport was born in Ottawa, Ohio, on July 16, 1908, and received a bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago in 1929. She earned her doctorate in education from Northwestern University in 1942.         In 1931, she married Harvey L. Horwich, who was later a technical consultant to the United States Air Force. Mr. Horwich died in the early 1970's. The couple had no children.         For more than two decades before first ringing the ''Ding Dong'' bell, Ms. Horwich worked in education. She taught first grade, supervised nursery schools in Chicago, was a principal, and held professorships in education at the University of North Carolina and Roosevelt College in Chicago.         But her biggest class was filled with the millions of children in America's living rooms born just a few years after World War II.         ''Our little school gives them a sense of belonging,'' she said.       
         Laura Foreman, the director of dance at the New School University and a visual artist, writer and teacher, died on June 15 in Manhattan. She was 64 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, said her companion, Richard Keene.         Ms. Foreman came to New York in the mid-1960's after receiving a degree in dance from the University of Wisconsin at Madison. She directed the dance program at the New School, long the center of her dance activities, from the late 1960's until her death.         Her Foreman Dance Theater and Composers' and Choreographers' Theater were in residence at the school. There Ms. Foreman provided much needed exposure for new and avant-garde choreographers and dancers in several dance and music series, among them Choreoconcerts and Critiques. She and her company also performed regularly into the 1970's at the Cubiculo and the American Theater Lab.         One of Ms. Foreman's best-known pieces was her 1981 ''Wallwork,'' created with her husband, the composer John Watts, a frequent collaborator who died in 1982. A conceptual event, it existed only in advertising posters and on a telephone reservations number, which grew very busy when a sold-out sign was slapped on the posters. Ms. Foreman also worked in film and video, winning awards for her ''TimeCoded Woman I, II, III.''         After Mr. Watts's death, she concentrated on art and writing. She began to exhibit sculptures in the early 1980's, becoming most famous for her 1990 ''Birdhouse as Metaphor,'' a show at the Souyun Yi Gallery in SoHo. The New Yorker described the sculptures as ''serious ruminations on the housing crisis, homelessness and personal entrapment.'' Many were eventually installed in neighborhood gardens in Manhattan.         Ms. Foreman's short stories were published in journals, including Confrontation and Lamia. Her stories were collected in a book, ''Close Encounters,'' published in 1997 by Outloud Books. She was also a co-founder and member of Artists and Scientists in Collaboration.         In addition to Mr. Keene, she is survived by her mother, Gladys Foreman of Los Angeles.       
         Elizabeth Yates, a writer whose books, many of them for children, were more than enough to fill a library shelf, died on Sunday at a hospice in Concord, N.H. A resident of Peterborough, N.H., she was 95.         Ms. Yates published her first book in 1938 and wrote more than 50 others into the mid-1990's. Many remain in print, including one that has taught young readers about black history in New England for half a century.         First published in 1950, ''Amos Fortune, Free Man'' traced the story of an adolescent African prince sold into slavery and brought to this country. Ms. Yates became aware of him when she happened upon his grave in a New Hampshire cemetery.         Intrigued by the inscription, she painstakingly researched his life and found how he, a complex man with a deep sense of honor, bought his freedom and built a home, a family and his own successful business as a skilled weaver and tanner. Like 25 other books by her, it was illustrated by her friend, the British artist Nora Unwin. It won the 1951 Newbery Medal and was translated into several foreign languages, as were some of her other books.         She also wrote an autobiographical trilogy and biographies of some strong-willed people. Among the latter was ''Prudence Crandall'' (Aladdin, 1955), about a teacher who defied Connecticut law in 1833 when she opened a private girls' school that accepted black and white pupils as equals.         Elizabeth Yates was born in Buffalo and went to school there and in Mamaroneck, N.Y. Living in Europe in the 1930's she started writing travel articles for American newspapers, including The Christian Science Monitor and The New York Times.         Back in this country she helped organize writers' conferences and lectured at Christian Writers and Editors Conferences in Green Lake, Wis.         She was active as an environmentalist. One of her books, ''The Road Through Sandwich Notch'' (Greene, 1972; reprinted 1984) helped to discourage development of that part of the White Mountains and to turn it into a national forest. She donated her Peterborough home, along with 45 acres of land, to the State of New Hampshire and the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests.         Her husband, William McGreal, died in 1963.       
         Jane Dudley, a prominent dancer in Martha Graham's company in the 1930's and 40's who was also one of early modern dance's social-protest choreographers and a leading teacher in the United States and Britain, died on Wednesday in London. She was 89.         Ms. Dudley had lived in London since 1970, when she started to teach at the London Contemporary Dance School, founded by the Graham patron Robin Howard to further modern dance in Britain.         One of the most influential teachers of early Graham technique, she was director of contemporary dance studies at the London school until 1991, retiring from it in 1998. Although suffering from an arthritic hip and virtually crippled in her last years, she continued to choreograph. She appeared in ''Dancing Inside,'' a recent film about her work that was shown last year at the Dance on Camera festival at Lincoln Center.         Tall and powerful in her movement, with remarkably expressive long arms, Ms. Dudley was initially identified with the roles she created in some of Martha Graham's signature works. In the 1940 ''Letter to the World,'' Graham's lyrical but fierce  meditation on Emily Dickinson and her poetry, Ms. Dudley was the Ancestress, a symbol of death and of the Puritan heritage.         Ms. Graham's Emily figure was nurtured in Ms. Dudley's arms, but the same arms also separated the heroine and her lover later with amazingly powerful swings. John Martin in The New York Times reviewed Ms. Dudley in the same role in 1953. ''She is mother, conscience, death, negation, tender care,'' he wrote, ''and she manages with great eloquence, to be both cruel and compassionate.''         None of that force seemed lost in 1970 when Ms. Dudley returned as the Ancestress in a guest appearance with the Graham troupe at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The same season featured a revival of ''Death and Entrances,'' in which Graham, Ms. Dudley and Sophie Maslow had personified the Brontë sisters in 1943.         Ms. Dudley's 1938 signature piece, ''Harmonica Breakdown,'' was in a different vein. Graham often commented on political and social issues, including the Depression and the Spanish Civil War. Ms. Dudley, however, belonged to a more politically radical wing of modern dance.         She was a founder in l942 of the New Dance Group (an outgrowth of the earlier Workers' Dance League), which openly proclaimed the left-wing sympathies of its dancers and choreographers. Many of their dances were topical social-protest pieces. This was also true of many but not all works that Ms. Dudley, Ms. Maslow and William Bales created for a small troupe, the Dudley-Maslow-Bales Trio, from 1942 to 1954.         Early pieces by Ms. Dudley bore titles like ''In the Life of a Worker,'' ''Songs of Protest,'' ''Under the Swastika'' and ''Women of Spain.'' But ''The Lonely Ones'' in 1946 was based on the cartoons of William Steig.         When Ms. Dudley set ''Harmonica Breakdown'' to the music of Sonny Terry on the harmonica and Brownie McGhee on the washboard in 1938, it was seen originally as a solo of despair in the Dust Bowl era. She later described the repeated shuffle she performed in this solo as ''the effort that just living might seem to mean to black people.'' Revived in recent years to the acclaim of modern-dance troupes in the United States and Europe, the solo now appears vivid but more universal.         Ms. Dudley was born on April 3, 1912 in New York City, where she attended the Walden School and started dance lessons at 6 with Ruth Doing. She attended the University of North Carolina. She studied dance in New York with Hanya Holm and performed with her company before joining the Graham troupe in 1935.         She remained a member until 1944, but later appeared as a guest artist with the company. She taught as an assistant to Graham at the Neighborhood Playhouse and at the Graham school from 1938 to 1958. Later her students in London and at the New Dance Group knew her to be a exacting and uncompromising teacher.         Ms. Dudley was divorced from Leo Hurwitz, a filmmaker. She is survived by her son, Tom Hurwitz, of New York, and three grandchildren.       
         Barbara K. Olson, who was killed on Tuesday on the commercial jetliner that was hijacked and flown into the Pentagon, was well known to television viewers across the nation as a combative and confident political commentator representing the conservative Republican point of view.         Mrs. Olson, 45, was also half of a highly influential couple on Washington's social-political scene; her husband, Theodore B. Olson, an appellate lawyer, successfully argued the Florida election case for George W. Bush before the Supreme Court. President Bush named Mr. Olson the nation's solicitor general, the official who formulates the administration's strategy before the nation's courts.         Mr. Olson was in his Justice Department office on Tuesday morning when he received two calls from Mrs. Olson, who was using her cell phone aboard American Airlines Flight 77 to tell him the plane had been hijacked. Her description of what was occurring in her last moments provided what officials said was valuable information about the incident. She reported that the flight crew had been herded to the back of the plane with the passengers, and she asked her husband what she should tell the pilot who was apparently beside her while the hijackers were in control of the cockpit.         Mrs. Olson's friends and her husband said her efforts to ''do something'' on the doomed plane were exquisitely in character. ''She never sat back,'' her husband said in an interview.         The Olsons, who were married four years ago, complemented each other in style. Mrs. Olson was the more outspoken of the two in her televised commentaries, while Mr. Olson presented a more deliberative face in his role as the reigning constitutional litigator for the Republican establishment.         Although Mrs. Olson was generally a take-no-prisoners advocate, Mr. Olson recalled on Tuesday that she recently told him she had come to believe that the national political debate had become too acrimonious. He recalled that she said that during one television appearance, she believed those who called in comments to her and her liberal counterpart, Bill Press, were far too harsh.         Barbara Kay Bracher Olson was born on Dec. 27, 1955, in Houston, and trained to be a teacher at the University of St. Thomas in her hometown. But, she had told friends, she wanted to save enough money to go to law school and decided a quicker way to do so than teaching was to become a part of the film industry.         With no experience in the field but  an abundance of self-confidence, she moved to Hollywood and began telephoning production companies connected to well-known actors, offering herself as an all-around helper. Stacy Keach finally offered her a job, Mr. Olson recalled this week, and when she saved enough money to go to law school, she moved to New York to attend the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University.         Mrs. Olson turned down jobs in New York after law school because she yearned to live in Washington. As chief counsel for the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee's Republican majority from  1995 to 1996, Mrs. Olson led the investigation into President Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton's role in firing longtime employees of the White House travel office. She became a caustic and relentless critic of the Clintons.         Mrs. Olson wrote ''Hell to Pay'' (Regnery, 1999), a highly critical book about Mrs. Clinton, and recently finished a sequel, ''Final Days,'' about the Clintons' last weeks in the White House. Mr. Olson said it would be published by Regnery.         Mrs. Olson is survived by her brother, David Bracher, and her sister, Antoinette Lawrence, both of Houston, as well as her husband.       
         Margaret Byrd Rawson, an educator, researcher and author who spent some 70 years identifying and treating reading disorders, died on Nov. 25 at her home near Frederick, Md. She was 102.         She wrote nine books and many articles on dyslexia and was an early and enduring force in the International Dyslexia Association, a 13,000-member professional group based in Maryland. She was its national president in the 1960's, when it was called the Orton Society. She received the group's lifetime achievement award on her 100th birthday.         Born in Rome, Ga., she was reared in Philadelphia and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Swarthmore College in 1923. In 1940, she received a master's degree from the University of Pennsylvania, where she studied elementary education and psychology, with emphasis on educational testing and measurements.         In 1929, Mrs. Rawson helped establish the School in Rose Valley, a private school near Philadelphia, and was a librarian, psychologist and teacher until 1947. It was there that she came to the field of dyslexia.         She had been trying in vain to help a boy who had great trouble reading. Frustrated, she enlisted the assistance of Dr. Samuel T. Orton, the neurologist who identified dyslexia and its causes. Dr. Orton tested the child and sent him back with what are known as Orton-Gillingham teaching materials devised to overcome such difficulties. The boy was soon reading at grade level, and Mrs. Rawson had found her niche.         Mrs. Rawson conducted one of the longest-running studies of people with neurological language problems, tracking the lives of 56 children from the school for more than 50 years. Many of them went on to successful careers and stayed in contact with her.         Moving to Frederick in 1947, she taught sociology at Hood College. She also was a clinical psychologist and language consultant and had a private practice diagnosing and correcting language disorders.         Her books included ''A Bibliography on the Nature, Recognition and Treatment of Language Difficulties'' (1966) and ''Developmental Language Disability: Adult Accomplishments of Dyslexic Boys'' (1968).         Mrs. Rawson's husband, Arthur, an engineer, died in 1963. She is survived by a son, Kenneth S., of Swarthmore, Pa.; six grandchildren; and 13 great-grandchildren.         Mrs. Rawson was 99 when she testified before the Maryland Department of Education. The hearing, on the teaching of reading, lasted four hours and she was there for the duration.       
         Mary Whitehouse, a British schoolteacher and mother of three who for more than 30 years campaigned vociferously against sex, violence and blasphemy on television, stage and screen, died on Nov. 23 in Colchester, England. She was 91.         Variously called ''the most dangerous woman in Britain,'' ''the Queen of Clean'' and ''the Archangel of Anti-Smut,'' Mrs. Whitehouse became in the end a beloved national institution, though she achieved far less than she sought. She struggled tirelessly to quell a rising tide of libertarianism in British public entertainment as the country traversed the ''Swinging 60's'' and embraced the ''Permissive Society.''         Her case, put simply, was that television programs and theater obsessed with sex and violence would breed that kind of a society. Many people agreed with her.         She was not without effect. ''The Clean Up TV Campaign,'' which she started in 1964 and which the next year became the National Viewers and Listeners Association, influenced several pieces of British legislation.         These included the 1978 Protection of Children Act, which curbed the pornographic exploitation of minors; the Indecent Displays Acts of 1981, regulating shop window displays and magazine covers; the creation of a Broadcasting Standards Committee in 1988; and the 1990 Broadcasting Act, which dealt with television obscenity.         She was responsible for banning the Danish film ''The Sex Life of Jesus Christ'' in 1977. In 1979, she instigated Britain's first blasphemy trial in 52 years, which resulted in a suspended nine-month jail sentence for the editor of Gay News. In 1982, she brought, but later dropped, a private prosecution against Howard Brenton's play ''The Romans in Britain,'' which explicitly portrayed sexual acts.         Her bête noire was Sir Hugh Carleton Greene, the BBC's liberal director general from 1960 to 1969, whom she called ''the Devil incarnate.'' Not only did he ignore and snub her, he also used to throw darts at a picture of her he had acquired, which depicted her as having five breasts.         But even if the tasks she had set herself were possible, which seems doubtful today, her all-or-nothing, blunderbuss approach doomed her efforts to failure.         Beloved British comics were condemned along with obvious pornographers because they all used words like damn and bloody. Anything that included foul language, adultery or homosexuality was bad in her eyes, regardless of its artistic quality or overall moral stance.         As a result, she was soon attacking a lengthening list of admired and popular works, including the ''EastEnders'' television series; Lord Snowdon's acclaimed documentary about old age, ''Don't Count The Candles''; and Dennis Potter's ''Singing Detective.''         Mary Hutcheson was born in Nuneaton, in Cheshire, on June 13, 1910. She was a staunch Christian and member of the Moral Rearmament movement who at 20 fell in love with an older married man but left him when she saw the unhappiness she had caused his wife.         She trained as an art teacher, and in 1940 married Ernest Whitehouse, an engineer, who died last year. After raising three sons, who survive her, she returned to teaching in 1960, becoming senior mistress at a Shropshire secondary school, in charge of sex education.         This anonymous provincial existence changed in 1963 with the eruption of the Profumo sex scandal, when Mrs. Whitehouse was horrified to discover that her girls regarded Christine Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies, the two call girls at the center of the affair, as heroines and role models. The next year she started her Clean Up TV Campaign.         Correction:  December 20, 2001, Thursday  An obituary on Dec. 3 about Mary Whitehouse, a British crusader against pornography, misidentified her native county. Her birthplace, Nuneaton, is in Warwickshire, not Cheshire.       
         Mercedes Matter, a painter, teacher and the chief founder of the New York Studio School in Greenwich Village, died on Tuesday. She was 87  and lived in East Hampton on Long Island.         Mrs. Matter was born Mercedes Carles in New York in 1913. Her father, the American modernist Arthur B. Carles, had studied with Matisse. Her mother, Mercedes de Cordoba, was a model for Edward Steichen. Ms. Matter grew up in Philadelphia, New York and Europe.         She began painting under her father's supervision at age 6, and studied art at Bennett College in Millbrook, N.Y., and then in New York City with Maurice Sterne, Alexander Archipenko and Hans Hofmann.         In the late 1930's, she was an original member of the American Abstract Artists organization and worked for the federal Works Progress Administration, assisting Fernand Léger on his mural for the French Line passenger ship company. Léger introduced her to Herbert Matter, the Swiss graphic designer and photographer, whom she married in 1939.         The Matters were active in the emerging New York art scene and also traveled frequently to Europe. Their closest friends included Jackson Pollock, Lee Krasner, Franz Kline, Philip Guston, Alexander Calder and Willem de Kooning. They were also close to Alberto Giacometti, who was an important artistic role model for Mrs. Matter and a frequent photographic subject for her husband.         Beginning in 1953, Mrs. Matter taught at the Philadelphia College of Art (now University of the Arts), Pratt Institute and New York University. Based on her teaching experiences she wrote an article for Art News in 1963 titled ''What's Wrong with U.S. Art Schools?'' In it, she lamented the phasing out of the extended studio classes required to initiate ''that painfully slow education of the senses,'' which she considered an artist's life work.         The article prompted a group of Pratt students to ask her to form a school based on her ideas, which led, in 1964, to the founding of the New York Studio School. Originally in a loft on Broadway, the school gained almost immediate support from the Kaplan Fund, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and the Ford Foundation. It granted no degrees, had only studio classes and emphasized drawing from life. Its teachers, chosen by the students, included the artists Guston, Bradley Walker Tomlin, Charles Cajori, Louis Finkelstein and Sidney Geist; the art historian Meyer Schapiro; and the composer Morton Feldman.         The Matters lived on Macdougal Alley, where Mr. Matter had a studio in one of the eight small buildings that had housed what is now the Whitney Museum of American Art. It was his idea that the buildings would make a perfect home for the Studio School, which bought them from the Whitney family in 1967.         Mrs. Matter practiced as she preached, spending months, and sometimes years, working on drawings and paintings that usually began as still lifes and evolved into near-abstractions animated by thatched lines that attested to her her devotion to the work of Giacometti and Cézanne.         In addition to her art and teaching, she wrote articles on artists, including Hofmann, Kline and Giacometti. She wrote the text for a book of her husband's photographs of Giacometti, published in 1987, four years after his death.         Mrs. Matter had her first solo show in New York at the Tanager Gallery in 1956. Her most recent was a double bill of drawings, shown in the Studio School's gallery, and paintings, at Salander O'Reilly Galleries. She taught at the school until last year.         She is survived by her son, Alexander, and a grandson, Jordan Matter, both of New York.
