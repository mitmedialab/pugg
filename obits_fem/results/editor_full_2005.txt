         Lucy Freeman, a reporter and an author whose early coverage of psychiatry and mental health for The New York Times led to wider reporting on the subject, died on Wednesday at the Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale, in the Bronx. She was 88.         The cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease, said her nephew David L. Schroedel.         Ms. Freeman, one of the few women on the Times's reporting staff when she was hired in 1940, initially wrote light society features, but moved to breaking news with an award-winning story on the explosion of two ships hauling munitions in Galveston Bay, Tex., in 1947.         By the late 1940's, some time after she began undergoing her own psychoanalysis, she persuaded editors to allow coverage of the growth of psychiatry and the preservation of Sigmund Freud's private papers.         ''It was even more unusual because it was in an era in which psychology was not popular,'' said Nan Robertson, the author of ''The Girls in the Balcony: Women, Men and The New York Times.'' ''It used to be that people poked fun at getting shrunk.''         Over the course of four years, she reported on welfare, the stigma of mental illness and advancements in treatments for schizophrenic patients. She also studied mental health and welfare programs in the city hospital system.         Her nonfiction books, ranging from detailed studies of Freud to those exploring sources of anger and anxiety, helped familiarize a popular audience with what had long been a hush-hush practice.         Ms. Freeman's first book, ''Fight Against Fears,'' recounted her own experience as a psychoanalysis patient who struggled to overcome her shy, whispery voice and social fears. Published in 1951, the book was in print for 47 years.         Ms. Freeman also wrote 77 other books, including mystery novels and memoirs.         The first of four children born to a prominent New York family, Ms. Freeman was a member of the first graduating class at Bennington College in Vermont.         She was hired by The New York Times in 1940 and would later describe the newsroom of the day as ''a sea of male reporters.''         ''I hardly dared savor the glory. All those men,'' she wrote in a memoir, ''The Beloved Prison,'' (St. Martin's Press, 1989). ''I also dared the fleeting thought that among all these masculine forms perhaps I would find a husband.''         She eventually married William M. Freeman, an editor who had fixed an error in a story she filed from Texas. The marriage lasted two years.         Fond of low-cut dresses and high-heeled shoes, Ms. Freeman relished the attention she received from her male colleagues on the city desk, Ms. Robertson said. Mary Yost, Ms. Freeman's agent for more than 15 years, said that she digested academic papers like a scholar, but always preferred to write for a larger audience.         She could at times ''appear to be an ingénue, an innocent,'' Ms. Yost said, but she also played a mean game of poker, loved throwing large parties at her apartment with a view of Central Park, and mixed as easily with jockeys as she did with actors and intellectuals.         ''She enjoyed a popular audience for her work, and she wanted it in her social life, too,'' Ms. Yost said.         Ms. Freeman is survived by her brother, Edward Greenbaum of Clearwater, Fla; her sister, Sue Polera of Las Vegas; her sister and brother-in-law, Sally and Warren Rosenberg of Scarborough, N.Y.; and numerous nieces and nephews.       
         Marjorie Williams, a Washington Post columnist and contributing editor for Vanity Fair who was known for sharp observations on the political elite, died yesterday at her home in Washington. She was 47.         The cause was liver cancer, said her husband, Timothy Noah.         Ms. Williams became a columnist in 2000, after more than a decade of writing lengthy profiles on Washington power brokers, including Vice President Al Gore and the Democratic diplomat Clark Clifford.         Her column was syndicated in July 2001, the same week her fourth-stage cancer was diagnosed, Mr. Noah said.         Ms. Williams attended Harvard for two years, but dropped out and went to work in publishing, where she worked for several years before getting a job as an editor at The Post. Later, she asked to move to a writing position in The Post's Style section and frequently wrote for Vanity Fair.         ''What she used to say at the time was, 'I want to be one of the children as opposed to one of the grown-ups,'' said Mr. Noah, a writer for Slate who frequently showed his wife his own stories. ''But what she was most proud of was being a mom.''         In a column published last November, Ms. Williams wrote of her helping her daughter dress in an elaborate Halloween costume.         ''So how could I explain the euphoria of the 45 minutes Alice and I spent in her bedroom, colluding over her hair, giggling at her faux leather, deeply fringed bell-bottoms? The pleasure of watching her strap on those awful silver platform shoes, like something I wore in 1973?'' she wrote. ''I'd just seen Alice leave for her prom, or her first real date. I'd cheated time, flipping the calendar five or six years into the future. The character I'd played was the 52-year-old mother I will probably never be.''         In addition to her husband and her daughter, Ms. Williams is survived by her son, Will, and her sisters, Wistar Rawls of Monkton, Vt., Anne Williams of Ringoes, N.J., and Rosina Williams of Jersey City.       
         Georgia Macris, an editor of influential energy industry publications for three decades, died on Jan. 13 at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 86.         The cause was lung cancer, her sister, Sophie Hocknell, said.         Ms. Macris graduated from Radcliffe College in 1940. She joined the Red Cross and served in the Pacific during World War II.         She was hired by McGraw-Hill World News in New York in 1947. When McGraw-Hill began publishing Petroleum Week magazine in 1955, she was named an assistant editor and then, a year later, foreign news editor. In 1961, she was named foreign news editor of Platts Oilgram News, a newsletter published by McGraw-Hill.         In 1968, Ms. Macris moved to Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, a newsletter that was then independently published by Wanda Jablonski and is now part of the Energy Intelligence Group. Ms. Macris served as managing editor from 1970 and as editor from 1972, retiring in 1983.         Ms. Macris chronicled the transformation of the international oil industry from the 1950's. She charted how the business evolved from one dominated by major corporations to one controlled by the nationalized companies in the 1970's.         Ms. Macris is survived by her sister, Ms. Hocknell, of Salem, Mass.       
         Leslie Gourse, a prolific author best known for her biographies of a wide range of jazz musicians and singers, died on Dec. 23 at her home in Manhattan. She was 65.         The cause was respiratory problems, said her cousin Melvin Zurier.         The author or editor of more than 30 books, Ms. Gourse devoted most of her writing to profiles of jazz virtuosos, starting in 1984 with ''Louis' Children: American Jazz Singers,'' a collection of biographical sketches.         Her most notable full-length biographies included ''Unforgettable: The Life and Mystique of Nat King Cole'' (1991), ''Sassy: The Life of Sarah Vaughan'' (1993) and ''Skain's Domain: A Biography'' (1999), which she wrote with the participation of its subject, Wynton Marsalis. She later chronicled the lives of Art Blakey (2001) and Carmen McRae (2002).         The magazine Jazz Times named her biography ''Straight, No Chaser: The Life and Genius of Thelonious Monk'' (1997), one of the top jazz books of the year         Her many books for children included at least six musical surveys along the lines of her 1998 book for young adults, ''Deep Down in Music: The Art of the Great Jazz Bassists.'' She also profiled performers like Mahalia Jackson and Gloria Estefan for a series of children's books published by Franklin Watts.         Roberta Leslie Gourse was born on Jan. 1, 1939, in Fall River, Mass., and graduated from Columbia in 1960. She soon published ''With Gall and Honey,'' a novel depicting romance and self-discovery in Israel.         She is survived by her mother, Zelda Fisher Gourse, of Providence, R.I.       
         Sarah Jewler, the managing editor of New York magazine, died on Wednesday in Manhattan. She was 56.         The cause was a rare blood disorder she had suffered with for many years, said her husband, Jay Kennedy.         Ms. Jewler was a steady presence at the magazine even as it switched editors, owners and editorial approaches. She was hired as managing editor in 1994 by its editor at the time, Kurt Andersen, and continued to serve in that role under Caroline Miller and, more recently, Adam Moss.         ''She was in many ways the emotional center of the magazine,'' said Ms. Miller, who left the magazine in February 2004. As managing editor, Ms. Jewler coordinated the practical parts of putting together a weekly, including negotiating writers' payments and contracts, devising annual budgets and ensuring the steady flow of articles.         Sarah Jewler was born on May 18, 1948, in Washington and graduated from George Washington University. Before joining New York magazine, she worked at Manhattan Inc., The Village Voice and Rolling Stone with many of the more prominent editors of the last few decades, including Peter W. Kaplan and Clay Felker.         ''When I met her, she exuded former hipster -- she had lived in communes and been a rock drummer,'' said Mr. Kaplan, who is now the editor of The New York Observer. ''She could make people fall into line by lifting an eyebrow,'' he added. She continued to work until last week.         In addition to Mr. Kennedy, who is editor in chief of the King Features Syndicate, Ms. Jewler is survived by a brother, Leonard Jewler of Washington, and her mother, Esther Jewler of Silver Spring, Md.       
         Chesbrough Lewis Patcevitch, a former New York social figure and fund-raiser for charitable causes, died on Dec. 28 in Miami. She was 92 and she lived in West Palm Beach, Fla.         Her death was announced by her family.         Mrs. Patcevitch, who married four times, was the widow of Iva S.V. Patcevitch, a former president and chairman of Condé Nast Publications. He died in 1993 after 30 years of marriage. She was the mother of Chessy Rayner, a decorator and fashion writer and editor who died in 1998.         A native of Perrysburg, Ohio, the young Chesbrough Lewis was a cafe society beauty photographed by Horst and Avedon. She formerly lived in Southampton, N.Y., and on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         She was active most notably for Southampton Hospital and Just One Break Inc., known as JOB.         Mrs. Patcevitch is survived by a son, Charles Minot Amory III of Palm Beach, and three grandsons.       
         Elizabeth Janeway, who began her career as a best-selling novelist in the 1940's and later distinguished herself as a critic, a lecturer and an early advocate of the women's movement, died yesterday at a retirement home in Rye, N.Y. She was 91.         Her death was reported by her son Michael Janeway, a writer and editor who is a professor at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism.         Most of Ms. Janeway's earlier books were novels that focused on family situations and occasionally the pressures on women of modern society and were cited for their psychological acuteness and good sense. All the while, she reviewed books for The New York Times and other newspapers, and was credited for helping to introduce English writers like Anthony Powell to an American audience and for defending the artistic merits of ''Lolita,'' by Nabokov.         In the 1970's, she began to write nonfiction books about feminist issues: ''Man's World, Woman's Place: A Study of Social Mythology'' (Morrow, 1971), ''Between Myth and Morning: Women Awakening'' (Morrow, 1974), ''Powers of the Weak'' (Knopf, 1980) and ''Improper Behavior'' (Morrow, 1987), among others.         Despite her conventional-seeming role as a wife and mother, she was always staunch in her support of feminism, remaining friends with women like Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem and Kate Millett, her son said. Reviewing ''Between Myth and Morning'' in The Christian Science Monitor, June Goodwin wrote: ''Of all the writers on the subject of feminism,'' Ms. Janeway ''has the most acceptability in the eyes of men. She has credentials, she is married to a successful man'' -- the economist and writer Eliot Janeway -- ''has children; as recently as 1969 she termed the women's movement 'frivolous and gestural.'''         Ms. Goodwin concluded that women ''need to read books'' like this ''to have their thoughts and experience confirmed and thus to be reinforced for action.''         Elizabeth Hall Janeway was born Oct. 7, 1913, in Brooklyn, the granddaughter of an Episcopal minister and the younger daughter of Charles H. Hall, a naval architect, and Jeanette F. Searle Hall.         After graduating from the Shore Road Academy in Brooklyn, she spent a year, 1930-31, at Swarthmore College. Her son said that because the Depression wiped out her family's savings, she broke off her education to spend a year writing advertising copy for a department store, Abraham & Straus, and handling orders for the Book of the Month Club.         She then went to Barnard College, taking her B.A. degree in 1935.         In 1938, she married Mr. Janeway, who died in 1993. Their second son, William Hall Janeway, a financial executive, also survives her.         In 1943, she published her first novel, ''The Walsh Girls'' (Doubleday), about two New England sisters, one of whom rejoins the other after her German husband's death in a concentration camp. The book was praised by John Dos Passos, and it became a best seller. Six more novels followed, among them ''Daisy Kenyon'' (Doubleday, 1945), which was made into a movie starring Joan Crawford; ''Leaving Home'' (Doubleday, 1953; reissued by CUNY, 1987); and ''Accident'' (Harper & Row, 1964), as well as several books for young people and collections on writing that she edited.         Ms. Janeway was also active on behalf of writers, serving as president of the Authors Guild from 1965 to 1969, a longtime member of the executive board of the American Center of Poets, Essayists and Novelists, a member of the board of directors of the McDowell Colony, and a judge for both the National Book Awards and the Pulitzer Prizes.         She was a trustee of Barnard, a fellow of Berkeley College at Yale University and a director of the Legal and Education Fund for the National Organization for Women.         Through her husband's involvement with the Roosevelt and Johnson administrations, she came to know many prominent Washington figures, including Eleanor Roosevelt, about whom she wrote profiles. At the request of Walter Reuther, the labor organizer, Ms. Janeway served as secretary of the National Committee to Aid Families of G.M. Strikers during an auto workers strike against General Motors soon after World War II.       
         Naomi Leff, an interior designer who created elegant spaces for celebrities and retailers like Ralph Lauren, Ferragamo, Gucci, Giorgio Armani and Helena Rubinstein, died on Sunday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 66.         The cause was complications of liver disease, her friend Barbara Ashley said.         She was not widely known by the public because she tended to work for wealthy, private customers. Among her residential clients were Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg, David Geffen, Barry Diller, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, and Mike Nichols and Diane Sawyer, her firm said.         Ms. Leff first attracted wide attention in 1986, when she transformed the Rhinelander Mansion at Madison Avenue and 72nd Street, built in 1898, into the flagship store for Polo Ralph Lauren.         As a profile of Ms. Leff for The New York Times in 1989 reported, she pieced together the building from the few original plans that remained, uncovering the site of the original staircase, and ''designed a grand mahogany stair that looks as though it has always been there.'' Similarly, she had ornamental plasterwork recast from surviving fragments so that it, too, appeared original. Writing in 1992, Paul Goldberger, The Times's architectural critic, called this ''the most successful conversion of a New York house into a luxury emporium since Cartier took over the former Morton Plant residence on Fifth Avenue.'' He said it achieved ''just the right balance between beautiful objects for sale and beautiful objects placed to enhance the experience of being in a stage set.''         By that time, Ms. Leff had designed interiors for Neiman-Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman and had worked from 1975 to 1980 as the senior designer for Bloomingdale's. She then designed interiors for yachts and private planes and the famously expensive Park Hyatt Beaver Creek Resort in Telluride, Colo.         Preferring what she called ''a modernist, minimalist aesthetic'' with occasional flourishes of Art Nouveau or Art Deco, she was able to capture almost any era or mood.         ''Architects tend to scorn interior decorators,'' said Paige Rense, the editor in chief of Architectural Digest, which published many articles about Ms. Leff's work and picked her as one of 30 or so Deans of Design in a recent issue. ''No architect scorned Naomi Leff, and she worked with some of the best.''         Ms. Leff was born on Aug. 4, 1939, in the Parkchester section of the Bronx, to Frank Leff, who worked for the American Jewish Committee, and Johanna Leff, a teacher in the New York City school system. She attended the High School of Music and Art in Manhattan, then received a Bachelor of Science degree from SUNY Cortland and a master's in sociology at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. Her parents survive her.         After teaching elementary school in the New York City public school system for a few years, Ms. Leff enrolled at Pratt Institute, earning a master's in environment design with a minor in architecture. In 1980 she opened her own design office, Naomi Leff & Associates, concentrating at first on retail and residential design.         She took an all-encompassing approach. At Shearson Lehman Hutton's Saddle Ridge Conference Center in Beaver Creek, Colo., for example, she put together an extensive, museum-quality collection of American West antique furnishings and artifacts that is now considered one of the best of its kind. Ms. Leff also designed the company's planes, a Gulfstream III and a Gulfstream IV.       
         Mary Kim Joh, a composer and medical researcher, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan, said her son, Insoo Joh. She was 101.         Ms. Joh is best known for ''School Bells,'' a 1945 anthem that must be learned by all students going into grammar school today in South Korea. She was asked by the South Korean government to compose children's songs after Japanese occupation ended and her nation was left with no Korean-language school materials.         Born in Seoul, Ms. Joh attended American missionary schools and graduated from Ewha Women's University, where she eventually became director of the music department after earning a master's degree in music at the University of Michigan. She taught music theory and composition in the United States before switching her profession to microbiology and biochemistry, receiving a master's degree in science from Wayne State University. In 1977, at 73, she joined the Peace Corps and worked in Liberia, in a hospital 600 miles from Monrovia.         She moved to New York in 1978 and worked with Korean-Americans there after Americans were evacuated from Liberia. In 1980 she received an honorary degree from Ewha for her humanitarian work in the United States and Africa, where she began a program called ''Spoons for Liberia,'' which sent sanitary utensils to the country in an effort to curb tropical diseases there. A program of financial grants was also established in her name to help talented teenagers become medical technicians.         Distressed to find there were no books on Korean music in American libraries, Ms. Joh also wrote ''Folk Songs of Korea,'' published by Wm. C. Brown Company Publishers, Iowa, in 1950.         Ms. Joh's husband, Owen, died in 1975. In addition to her son, Insoo, of Manhattan, she is survived by a daughter, Gwin Joh Chin, a magazine production editor at The New York Times, and a granddaughter, Andria Meredith, both of Manhattan, and a grandson, Eric, of Greensboro, N.C.       
         Phyllis W. Meadow, a psychoanalyst who worked to liberalize training and licensing in her field, died on Jan. 19 at St. Vincent's Hospital Manhattan. She was 80 and lived in Brookline, Mass., New York City and Dummerston, Vt.         The cause was gallbladder cancer, said her daughter, Dr. Dena Reed, who is also psychoanalyst.         At a time when the largest psychoanalytic professional association in the United States required psychoanalysts to have medical training, Dr. Meadow, whose doctorate was in human relations, actively sought to open the training of psychoanalysts to those without a medical degree. Their mission placed them at odds with many psychoanalysts, who felt that opening the field to lay analysts might lower standards.         In 1988, the American Psychoanalytic Association, in response to a restraint-of-trade suit by psychologists, agreed to open psychoanalytic training to candidates without medical degrees.         Dr. Meadow felt that ''any qualified person with a B.A. should be eligible to pursue training in psychoanalysis,'' said Jane Snyder, dean of graduate studies at the Boston Graduate School of Psychoanalysis, an alternative training program that Dr. Meadow founded in 1973.         Two of her chief missions, Dr. Snyder said, were to create greater diversity among the kinds of patients being treated and to reduce the number of therapeutic sessions from three to five a week to one or two.         Dr. Meadow taught, wrote, edited, practiced therapy, and founded and led organizations, including the Center for Modern Psychoanalytic Studies in Manhattan, along with its branch, the Cyril Z. Meadow Institute of Psychoanalysis, in Dummerston. This was named for her husband, who founded the New York Center with her and who died in 1998.         Watersheds in Dr. Meadow's campaign, Dr. Snyder said, were 1994, when the Boston Graduate School became one of the first institutions in this country to grant a master's degree in psychoanalysis, and 1999, when the Vermont branch was able to offer a doctorate.         Dr. Meadow also lobbied successfully to liberalize laws regulating the training of psychoanalysts, both federally and in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Vermont, California and other states.         Phyllis Whitcomb was born in Boston on April 12, 1924, the oldest of three daughters of George Whitcomb, a printing and publishing salesman, and Marjorie Loring Whitcomb, who became Gen. Omar Bradley's administrative assistant during World War II. She attended Watertown High School and earned a B.A. from the University of Maryland in 1946.         After working as a magazine writer and editor in New York City, she did clinical work at the National Psychological Association for Psychoanalysis, founded by Theodore Reik, receiving certification as a psychoanalyst in 1962. She got her doctorate from New York University in 1969.         Among her books are ''The New Psychoanalysis'' (Rowman & Littlefield, 2003) and ''Ethics for Psychoanalysis: In the Interest of the Patient'' (forthcoming from International Universities Press).         Besides her daughter, her survivors include two sisters, Susan Winbourne of Sudbury, Mass., and Jessie Roland of Navarre, Fla., and three grandchildren.       
         Eleanor Gould Packard, whose questions, comments and admonitions on the proofs of thousands of articles for The New Yorker for 54 years defined for many the care (some writers said obsessiveness) taken in editing the magazine, died Sunday in Manhattan. She was 87.         Her death was announced by her daughter, Susan Hathaway Packard.         Miss Gould, as she was known to the staff, challenged the logic, syntax, grammar, flow, usage, punctuation and vocabulary of a legion of nonfiction writers: E.B. White, Roger Angell, Wolcott Gibbs, Ved Mehta, Pauline Kael, Philip Hamburger, John McPhee, Lillian Ross. Many at The New Yorker believed the precisely penciled Gould proofs sustained its suavity of style.         David Remnick, the magazine's editor, once said: ''I think if there is an indispensable person here, it's Eleanor Gould. The relationship to her is as intimate as it gets; she has been inside my sentences.''         Invoking Harold Ross, the magazine's founding editor, Mr. Hamburger said, ''It is my impression that she brought to fruition an idea that Ross had, that everything should be looked at by a skeptical eye, not a cynical one, before it was presented to the public.''         Mr. Hamburger, who was interviewed several years before his death, sighed a little. ''Such probity and intelligence,'' he said.         Miss Gould's own view of her work was less glorified: ''I just try to make things right.''         Her work was not easily encompassed in a job title, and the magazine never saw a need to give her one. She was not a fact-checker, though she did find errors. She was not a story editor, copy editor or proofreader. She did not enter the process until an article had been examined by lawyers and editors and was in galley proof, close to the last minute. She worked her way down both margins, penciling corrections and suggestions in a legible hand, always providing her rationale.         ''A miracle to watch,'' said Edith Iglauer, an editor who once worked with her. ''The words danced across the page.''         As all editors know, showing such a thing to a tetchy or insecure writer might induce a tantrum. ''Not every writer gets to see a Gould proof,'' Mr. Angell said while she was still on the job. ''It's a challenge. You have to take a Gould proof seriously because she is a scrupulous reader, but you have to know what to ignore.'' If everything she recommended had been carried forward, he said, ''it would be like the purest water -- absolutely tasteless.''         Yet Mr. Remnick said on her death, ''If it's true The New Yorker is known for the clarity of its prose, then Miss Gould had as much to do with establishing that as its more famous editors and writers.''         He said that she had been greatly missed since a stroke took her off the job in 1999, but that there were still editors on the staff she had helped to train.         Miss Gould never used a computer and deadline pressure could sometimes render her handwritten work moot, especially during Tina Brown's chaotic six years as editor.         Eleanor Gould was born Oct. 3, 1917, in Newark, N.Y., to Wilson Mosher Gould, a lawyer, and Eleanor Loveland Gould. The family moved to Ohio and Eleanor graduated from high school in East Palestine, Ohio, in 1934. She won a scholarship to Oberlin and graduated summa cum laude with a major in English in 1938.         Aline Kilmer, a poet in New Jersey, became her mentor after years of correspondence Eleanor had initiated at 14. Kilmer taught her editing and helped her come to New York, and after several miserably paid editing jobs she applied to The New Yorker.         There was a myth that she flyspecked an entire issue and enclosed it with her application. But she described an application of less hubris: she noted two mistakes in recent issues, including, good Lord, a ''different than.''         She joined The New Yorker Nov. 5, 1945. Her marriage to Frederick A. Packard, also on the magazine's staff, came a year later, and the birth of their only child, Susan, a little more than a year after that. Her daughter and two grandsons survive.         In 1952, the family moved to Central Park West and 101st Street, where Miss Gould remained as long as she worked. She took a bus to the office on West 43rd Street, carrying a small lunch in an old shoe bag. For amusement, Miss Gould, who belonged at one time to Mensa, an organization of the supersmart, would factor the four-digit bus identification numbers.         In an interview in the summer of 1998, Miss Gould said she hoped to ''complete a century of Packards'' at The New Yorker. Her husband worked there for 45 years before he died in 1974. But for the stroke the year before, Miss Gould would have reached 55 years in 2000.         She was proud of her status. She cited the pinnacle she reached in 1972: a separate credit in ''The Elements of Style,'' the hugely popular text written by William Strunk Jr. and revived by E.B. White. The citation, which says, ''The co-author, E.B. White, is most grateful to Eleanor Gould Packard for her assistance in preparation of this second edition,'' recognized her as the linguistic equivalent of the Pope's confessor.         Interviewing Miss Gould for this obituary put the writer on the spot. Because she had been deaf since 1990, all questions had to be written; because of her status as a legendary editor, spelling counted. While asking about a Roger Angell statement, the interviewer at first wrote the name ''Angel,'' then added the second l. Miss Gould observed, ''I was going to say ''         Always the arbiter, she added, with amusement, ''I'll have to stage a faked death and come back to correct my obit.''       
         Shirley Fleming, a writer, editor and critic in the world of classical music for almost 50 years, died on Thursday in Augusta, Ga. She was 75.         Her cousin Martha Fleming said she died at the University Hospital of the Medical College of Georgia after a stroke that she had on Feb. 17.         Shirley Fleming had her most lasting effects on the music world behind the scenes. She was an editor for publications like Musical America, High Fidelity and Hi-Fi Music at Home, and most recently for American Record Guide. Many of classical music's active critics and writers received their first assignments from her. More or less steadily from 1978 until her death she was a music critic for The New York Post.         Ms. Fleming was born in New York in 1929 but grew up in Augusta, where she kept strong ties. Robert Kimball, the music theater historian and a colleague of Ms. Fleming at The Post, remembers her reluctance to accept review assignments except on weekdays. Weekends she often returned home, and although she lived in Manhattan, she maintained a home in Augusta.         Ms. Fleming's father was the distinguished Southern novelist Berry Fleming, who died in 1989 at 90. Popular in the 1930's and 40's, he published an admired comic novel, ''Captain Bennett's Folly,'' in 1989.         Ms. Fleming was educated at Smith College, where she earned an undergraduate and then a master's degree. Her musical training was as a violist. Assigning articles and reviews around the country and indeed around the world, Ms. Fleming touched and influenced many lives. She was an only child and leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Andre Norton, a prolific and popular science-fiction and fantasy writer whose central theme was the rite of passage to self-realization undertaken by misfits or displaced outsiders, died yesterday at her home in Murfreesboro, Tenn. She was 93.         The cause was congestive heart failure, Sue Stewart, her friend and caretaker, said.         In more than 130 novels, nearly 100 short stories and numerous anthologies that Ms. Norton edited in the science-fiction, fantasy, mystery and western genres, the theme of alienation and return keeps recurring.         In a typical story, ''Star Man's Son, 2250 A.D.'' (Harcourt, 1952) -- her first science-fiction novel -- Fors, a mutant rejected by a postwar society because of his differences, goes in search of a lost city rumored to be free of radiation. Accompanied by a cat with which he communicates telepathically, Fors discovers his own worth through a string of difficult tests.         ''Star Man's Son'' was the relatively late start of Ms. Norton's science fiction career; until then, she had mainly been a novelist writing juvenile historical fiction and adventure stories, under the pen name Andre Norton, chosen because her readers were thought to be exclusively boys         At the time, the market for science-fiction was largely confined to magazines, but with the growth of the genre in book form after 1950, Ms. Norton took the field by storm. Donald A. Wollheim, editor of the paperback house Ace Books, saw her potential in an adult market, acquired the rights to ''Starman's Son,'' published it under the title ''Daybreak -- 2250 A.D.,'' eliminating all references to the story and its author as being for young readers, and found himself with a steady seller.         Although Ms. Norton's subsequent books for Ace sold in the hundreds of thousands, she found herself the victim of a Catch-22: critics of science fiction did not take her seriously because she was considered a juvenile writer and critics of children's literature dismissed her because she wrote science fiction.         Her legions of readers remained loyal, however, and critics eventually came to take her seriously. She was the first woman to win the Gandalf Grand Master of Fantasy award and the Nebula Grand Master Award for lifetime achievement from the Science Fiction Writers of America.         Her work was praised for its unobtrusive depth and complexity. As Francis J. Molson wrote in the Dictionary of Literary Biography, ''It is possible that the pace and suspense of Norton's storytelling may so ensnare readers that they may overlook the themes and concerns her narratives embody.''         Foremost among those themes, many of her readers have said, was her insistence that personal fulfillment required accepting the individual's contradictions, whether they were sexual, racial or otherwise. For instance, the villains in her most popular series, ''Witch World,'' comprising about 30 volumes, are the females who think falsely that they have to remain virginal to retain their power.         In the same vein, Ms. Norton deplored people's embrace of technology.         ''I think the human race made a bad mistake at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution,'' she told Charles Platt in an interview for his ''Dream Makers Volume II: The Uncommon Men and Women Who Write Science Fiction'' (1983). ''We leaped for the mechanical things.''         She added, ''People need the use of their hands to feel creative.''         Alice Mary Norton, who changed her name legally to Andre Norton in 1934, was born on Feb. 17, 1912, in Cleveland, Ohio, the younger of two daughters of Adalbert Freely Norton, a rug salesman, and Bertha Stemm Norton. At Collingwood High School she wrote for the school newspaper and during her senior year produced her first novel, which, reworked, became her second published book, ''Ralestone Luck'' (Appleton, 1938).         Intending to become a history teacher, she attended Western Reserve University (now Case Western Reserve) but was forced to drop out in her freshman year because of the Depression. Taking a job at the Cleveland Public Library, she was assigned to the children's book section, allowing her to become expert in the literature. Though already interested in science fiction, she turned to writing history for young adults, publishing her first novel, ''The Prince Commands'' (Appleton, 1934), at 22.         Continuing to publish adventure novels, she stayed at the library until 1950, working in 38 of its 40 branches. In 1941, she interrupted that stint to work at the Library of Congress and to own a bookstore in Maryland. In 1950, she took a job as a reader at Gnome Press, the science-fiction publisher, and continued to write on the side. By the time she left, in 1958, to become a full-time writer, she had published 23 novels and several short stories. In the next two decades she wrote almost 70 novels and two dozen short stories, and edited several anthologies. She also collaborated with many writers.         In 1966, she moved to Florida and later to Murfreesboro, where in 1999 she founded High Hallack, a retreat and research library for writers that she closed in 2004.       
         Leona Rostenberg, a rare-book scholar and dealer who with her partner of 50 years, Madeleine B. Stern, discovered a series of racy novels written by Louisa May Alcott under a pseudonym, died on March 17 at her apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 96.         Ms. Rostenberg died after having heart problems for two years, said Abbey Lustgarten, a filmmaker who became friends with the two women while making a documentary about them.         The discovery in 1942 of the works by Alcott, all written before she gained fame as the author of ''Little Women,'' brought a moment of detective-work thrill for Ms. Rostenberg and her partner and forever altered Alcott scholarship.         A past president of the Antiquarian Booksellers' Association of America, Ms. Rostenberg wrote numerous books herself: scholarly works on printing history, and memoirs written with Ms. Stern that twinned their love of literary sleuthing with reminiscences of their life together.         Ms. Rostenberg's relationship with Ms. Stern, whom she met in 1930 and with whom she lived for nearly 50 years, runs like a constant thread through her decades in the world of rare books.         Writing in The New York Times in 1995, Dinitia Smith described the partnership as ''both a love story and a detective story, a tale of doggedness and devotion to books and to each other.''         That article led an editor to approach the women about doing a memoir of their lives; they had already written several books together about their profession and their experiences hunting down this or that volume. The result was ''Old Books, Rare Friends: Two Literary Sleuths and Their Shared Passion'' (Doubleday, 1997).         In it they evaluated their own relationship on Page 3. Referring to the article in The Times, they wrote: ''Several readers inferred from it that our relationship was a lesbian one. This was a misconception. The 'deep, deep love' that existed and exists between us and that is mentioned in Dinitia Smith's last paragraph has no bearing upon sex.''         The follow-up work, ''Bookends: Two Women, One Enduring Friendship'' (Free Press, 2001), focused even more on their relationship and intertwined personal lives, including a chapter called ''Men We Did Not Marry.''         Leona Rostenberg was born in the Bronx on December 28, 1908, to Dr. Adolph and Louisa D. Rostenberg. Her father was a dermatologist. She met Ms. Stern in 1930 while she was a senior at New York University and Ms. Stern was a freshman at Barnard.         Ms. Stern lent Ms. Rostenberg $1,000 to start her rare-book business and eventually joined her as partner. They lived first in Ms. Rostenberg's family house in the Bronx, and then in Manhattan.         They made their discovery about Louisa May Alcott after being tipped off by a scholar that she might have written works under a pseudonym to pay the rent, but that the pseudonym was mystery.         After seeing a reference to an ''A.M. Barnard'' in a correspondence between Alcott and a publisher, they knew they had found what -- or whom -- they had been looking for.         The discovery caused a re-evaluation of Alcott's career. Eventually, one of the lost Alcott works, ''A Long Fatal Love Chase,'' was published.         ''It completely changed the way people perceived Louisa May Alcott,'' Ms. Lustgarten said. ''What they knew about was 'Little Women,' and here were 'blood and thunder' tales -- meetings in opium dens and things like that. The polar opposite of 'Little Women' in the sense of being more risqué and passionate.''         Ms. Rostenberg is survived by two cousins, Richard F. Koch and Marion Alexander.       
         Alice Thomas Ellis, a British novelist celebrated for her witty, unflinching dissections of middle-class domestic life, died on Tuesday in London. She was 72 and lived in Wales.         A spokeswoman for Ms. Ellis's literary agent, Robert Kirby, confirmed the death. No cause was given, but several British newspapers reported that Ms. Ellis had been ill with lung cancer for some time.         Far better known in Britain than in the United States, Ms. Ellis's fiction defied easy categorization. With its blend of the transcendently spiritual and the achingly mundane, her work was compared, variously, to that of Virginia Woolf, Evelyn Waugh, Iris Murdoch and Muriel Spark.         Alice Thomas Ellis was the pseudonym of Anna Margaret Haycraft, who under her real name was an editor at Gerald Duckworth, the London publishing house run by her husband, Colin Haycraft.         Under her pen name, Ms. Ellis wrote a dozen slender novels, most published by Duckworth, among them ''The Sin Eater'' (1977); ''The Birds of the Air'' (1980); ''The Summer House,'' a trilogy (Penguin, 1994); and ''Fairy Tale'' (Moyer Bell, 1998). Her novel ''The 27th Kingdom'' (1982) was finalist for the Booker Prize.         She also published several nonfiction works, including ''A Welsh Childhood'' (Moyer Bell, 1997) and ''Serpent on the Rock: A Personal View of Christianity'' (Hodder & Stoughton, 1994).         Reviewing ''The Summer House'' in The New York Times Book Review in 1994, Francine Prose wrote, ''Its quick humor, prickly ironies and lack of portentous self-importance may mislead casual readers into overlooking its true heft, its provocative and disturbing shrewdness.''         Shot through with melancholy, Ms. Ellis's novels focus on the small savageries, deep discontents and abiding grief of women's lives. Yet they are also mordantly funny sendups of bourgeois manners. Sometimes, as in the work of Shirley Jackson, the gothic overlays the domestic, to unsettling effect. Many of Ms. Ellis's characters are repellent, and they are meant to be.         A spare stylist, Ms. Ellis could sketch a devastating portrait in a single phrase. In ''The Birds of the Air,'' she describes one character, an academic, as a man whose ''insistence on ordinary language and absolute clarity of expression rendered his discourse unintelligible to the ordinary person.''         Ms. Ellis was born Anna Margaret Lindholm in Liverpool on Sept. 9, 1932, and raised in Wales. Her father and mother were devout secular humanists, and at 19, Anna rebelled by converting to Roman Catholicism.She entered a convent as a postulant, but back problems forced her to leave the order, with its requirement of physical labor. She settled in London, where she met Mr. Haycraft; they were married in 1956 and had seven children. She eventually joined him as a fiction editor at Duckworth, where her list of writers included the novelist Beryl Bainbridge.         In 1977 Ms. Ellis published her own first novel, ''The Sin Eater.'' Set in Wales, it tells of a family drawn uneasily home by the impending death of its patriarch. In The Spectator, Peter Ackroyd praised the book for ''its wit: the relentlessness of domestic life, the knives only just sheathed in time.'' Ms. Ellis's pen name, chosen perhaps for its sibilant hiss, suited her style of elegant malice.         Ms. Ellis, who also wrote on domestic life and religion for several British publications, remained a passionately traditional Catholic who deplored efforts to modernize the church. In 1996 she was fired as a columnist for The Catholic Herald after she attacked the reforms of Derek Worlock, archbishop of Liverpool, who had recently died.         Ms. Ellis is survived by four sons, William, Thomas, Oliver and Arthur, and a daughter, Sarah. Another daughter, Rosalind Mary, died in infancy, and a son, Joshua, died in an accident as a teenager. Ms. Ellis's husband died in 1994.         Throughout her work, on subjects large and small, Ms. Ellis was concerned with the futility of connection. In 1987 The Times of London asked several prominent people to compose a Valentine's Day verse. Ms. Ellis's submission began, dryly: ''Men love women/Women love children/Children love hamsters.''       
         Elizabeth Crow, a magazine editor, writer and executive who revitalized Parents magazine, died on Monday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 58 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was complications of esophageal cancer, her son, Samuel Crow, said.         As editor in chief of Parents magazine from 1978 to 1988, Ms. Crow developed and carried out an overhaul in both appearance and content. She also created a line of books on child development with Ballantine Books and a series of similar videos.         She changed the magazine's approach, said her friend Betsy Carter, a writer and magazine editor. ''She made it O.K. to admit that children could be difficult,'' she said. ''That was a big change back then.''         In 1988, after Ms. Crow accepted the job of editor in chief of Self magazine, the publisher of Parents lured her back as chief executive officer of its American division, Gruner & Jahr USA, a unit of Bertelsmann A.G. of Germany. There she redesigned all seven of Gruner & Jahr's magazines; the company's revenues rose by more than 50 percent. She also e-launched YM and created BabyCare, along with three magazines for Spanish-speaking Americans.         Elizabeth Venture Smith was born in Manhattan on July 29, 1946, the eldest of six children of Harrison Venture Smith, a senior executive at Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, and Marlis deGreve Smith. After earning her B.A. from Mills College in 1968, she worked at The New Yorker briefly, attended Brown University to work toward a master's, then left to become an editor at New York magazine, where she stayed for 10 years before going to Parents.         In 1974, she married Patrick Crow, whom she met when he was an editor at The New Yorker. The marriage ended in divorce. She is survived by their three children, Samuel, of Manhattan; Rachel, of Brooklyn; and Sarah, of Manhattan; two brothers, Spencer Smith of Lee, N.H.; and Oliver Smith of Manhattan; two sisters, Anne Smith Tucker of Philadelphia, and Sarah Smith of Manhattan; and one grandchild.         In 1993, Ms. Crow left Gruner & Jahr to become editor in chief of Mademoiselle. In 2001, she joined Rodale publications as vice president and editorial director. The next year she was editorial director of Primedia's consumer magazine and media group, and at her death was editorial director of Consumers Union.       
         Faith McNulty, a New Yorker staff writer who wrote many books about animals and country life for adults and children, died last Sunday at her home in Wakefield, R.I. She was 86. The cause was complications of a stroke, her sister, Elisabeth Keiffer, said.         In 1980, Ms. McNulty notably departed from her usual subjects with "The Burning Bed: The True Story of an Abused Wife" (Harcourt), an account of how in 1977 Francine Hughes, a battered Michigan housewife, killed her husband by setting him on fire after he passed out from drinking. She was acquitted of murder by reason of temporary insanity.         In 1984, the book was made into an NBC-TV movie, with a de-glamorized Farrah Fawcett as the star. The film enhanced Ms. Hughes's image as an advocate for women's rights.         But Ms. McNulty's more usual line of work was books like "The Whooping Crane: The Bird That Defies Extinction" (Dutton, 1966) and "How to Dig a Hole to the Other Side of the World" (Harper, 1979), with illustrations by Marc Simont.         Ms. McNulty came to her interests early. Although a city child, born in New York on Nov. 28, 1918, she spent her childhood summers on her grandmother's farm in Wakefield. Her father, Joseph Eugene Corrigan, was a judge. Her original name was Faith Trumbull Corrigan.         Intending to become a writer, she attended Barnard College in 1937-38, but dropped out after a creative-writing teacher told her she had no talent.         In 1938, she married Charles M. Fair, a writer. The marriage ended in divorce. In 1945, she married John McNulty. She met him about 1942, her sister said in a telephone interview, when she was one of the first three copy girls hired by The Daily News, where he was a rewrite man. He had begun to sell stories to The New Yorker, and went to work there in 1944. He helped her to sell her first piece to the magazine. A decade later, in 1953, she was hired by the editor William Shawn as a Talk of the Town reporter.         After her husband's death, in 1956, Ms. McNulty settled permanently on a farm they had bought in Wakefield and began to write books. In 1957, she married Richard H. Martin, a prop designer for the theater. He died in 1984.         In addition to her sister, Ms. McNulty is survived by a son, John Joseph McNulty of Brooklyn, and four grandchildren.       
         Dale Messick, a pioneering newspaper cartoonist who fought her way to the top of a man's profession by creating Brenda Starr, the glamorous red-haired journalist who fought her way to the top of a man's profession, died on Tuesday in Sonoma County, Calif. She was 98.         She died after a long decline that began with a stroke in 1998, her daughter, Starr Rohrman, told The Associated Press. She had been caring for her mother at her home in Penngrove, Calif.         Ms. Messick was born on April 11, 1906; Brenda Starr was born in June 1940. An impossibly glamorous redhead, her appearance was inspired by Rita Hayworth; her first name came from the most famous debutante of the day, Brenda Frazier, and her last name was chosen because she was the star reporter on The Flash.         The Brenda Starr comic strip was a symphony of décolletage, good legs precariously balanced on high-heeled shoes, and Dior-like clothing that no woman would be likely to wear to a newspaper office.         During the war she was an ace reporter, chasing spies and other malefactors in cities and in jungles, fighting off sharks, giant squids and other ravenous animals, but selling war bonds, too. Her red hair was always attractively coiffed; her eyes always glistened with tiny starbursts.         She found time for romance with her mystery man, Basil St. John, a lean, square-jawed hunk who wore an eye patch and whose only other defect was that he was dying of an exotic disease. This frequently sent him to the jungle in search of a rare black orchid whose serum gave him temporary respite. While he was away, Brenda had more suitors than Penelope, but she remained loyal to her true love. Brenda finally married Basil in 1976, whereupon he vanished again on another orchid hunt.         As for Ms. Messick, she was married twice, to Everett George and Oscar Strom, and both marriages ended in divorce. She is survived by her daughter, from her first marriage, and two grandchildren.         Of her heroine's profession, she once explained, ''She was already a reporter when the strip started, but she was sick and tired of covering nothing but ice-cream socials. She wanted a job with action, like the men reporters had.''         But Ms. Messick knew little about the newspaper business and refused to learn about it, saying it might spoil her imagination.         ''Brenda Starr, Reporter'' was sometimes criticized by journalists for its outlandish depiction of their profession. In one strip, Brenda brings a typed story to The Flash late at night and hands it to a custodian, who somehow gets it into the next day's paper. On another occasion, she finds herself in an airplane she cannot fly, so she parachutes to safety, somehow landing in front of her editor's window.         And, in perhaps the greatest breach of authenticity, she talks back to her managing editor.         Ms. Messick hired other people to draw cars and other mechanical contraptions, animals and nature scenes. But for four decades, only she drew Brenda Starr's face and body.         Dalia Messick, born in South Bend, Ind., spent two years in the third grade and two years in the eighth grade and did not get her high school diploma until she was 20, and then only at the urging of her parents, Cephas Messick, a sign painter and vocational arts teacher, and Bertha Messick, a milliner; her work inspired some of Brenda's fetching hats.         Ms. Messick changed her name to Dale after she encountered discrimination against women entering the newspaper cartooning business. She told Norma Lee Browning of The Saturday Evening Post: ''Brenda is the glamorous girl I wished I was. ... She's what most women wish they were and what most men wish their women were, too.''         She originally thought of her character as a girl bandit, but was talked into making her a reporter by an aide to Joseph Medill Patterson, founder and publisher of The Daily News of New York and head of The Chicago Tribune-New York News Syndicate.         Ms. Messick had started drawing comic strips in school. After leaving school, she studied art for a summer in Chicago and worked for greeting card companies there and in New York, continuing to work on her comic strips at night. None were published until ''Brenda Starr'' was accepted by the syndicate.         After Brenda Starr appeared, Ms. Messick dyed her hair red to match Brenda's. ''I am Brenda Starr,'' she would say to interviewers.         ''Brenda Starr'' was twice adapted for the screen, first as a 1945 serial with Joan Woodbury, and later as a feature movie starring Brooke Shields. Shot in 1986, it was not released until 1992, when it opened to dismal notices. Ms. Messick warned everyone she met not to see it.         However, over the years, there were Brenda Starr dolls and even a postage stamp with Brenda's likeness on it, part of a series on 20 classic comic characters.         At its height, ''Brenda Starr'' appeared in 250 papers and is still syndicated by Tribune Media Services. Ms. Messick retired from drawing the strip in the mid-1980's, and it was passed on to other artists, all women. She said she did not like the way later versions of Brenda Starr looked.         In the 1990's, she developed a new comic character called ''Granny Glamour,'' who appeared in a single-panel cartoon in a publication for the elderly in California.         In her 80's, she boasted of juggling three boyfriends simultaneously.         ''All three wouldn't make one good man,'' she told an interviewer, ''but at my age, you can't be too choosy.''       
         Geraldine Stutz, who transformed Henri Bendel from a carriage trade retailer in decline into a chic emporium of designer brands in the 1960's, died yesterday at her home in New York. She was 80.         Her death came after a long illness, said her stepdaughter, Emma Turner.         Ms. Stutz is best known for her 29-year career as the president of Henri Bendel, with a legendary eye for discovering the newest designers and using them first, installing their collections in elaborately merchandised departments that heralded the introduction of a new generation of fashion stars -- Stephen Burrows, Perry Ellis, Jean Muir, Sonia Rykiel, Carlos Falchi, Mary McFadden, Holly Harp and Ralph Lauren among them.         Many longtime Bendel shoppers recall Ms. Stutz's 1958 overhaul of the main floor at the store, at 10 West 57th Street, into a U-shaped ''Street of Shops'' widely acknowledged as a precursor to modern shop-in-shop merchandising displays. Based on her taste alone, Ms. Stutz divided merchandise into small vitrines of watches, handbags, stockings, and along one side, an inspiring ''Gilded Cage,'' a giant replica of a birdcage that housed the cosmetics department.         ''Geraldine had a vision of the kind of store she wanted to create,'' said Jean Rosenberg, who was the vice president and merchandising director at Bendel's from six months before Ms. Stutz's arrival in 1957 to their joint departure in 1986, after the store was sold to The Limited. ''It was for a particular kind of New York woman, where she could find a uniformity of taste and a certain amount of comfort in a smallish environment, where everything in one store was to her liking.''         Ms. Stutz was born in Chicago on Aug. 5, 1924. She aspired to an acting career and studied drama at Mundelein College before changing her focus to journalism. She moved to New York to be closer to the theater and found work as a fashion editor for movie magazines, and in 1947 was hired as an associate fashion editor for Glamour magazine, where she covered shoes.         Colleagues described Ms. Stutz as an industrious learner who immersed herself in the subject matter. Grace Mirabella, the former editor of Mirabella magazine, recalled an introduction to Ms. Stutz in the early 1950's, when Ms. Mirabella was working at Vogue. ''She loved to talk about the business and what was going on behind the scenes, and she knew everything about shoes,'' Ms. Mirabella said.         Ms. Stutz put her knowledge to practical use when she went to work for several footwear manufacturers, including I. Miller, the company for which Andy Warhol designed advertisements, after it was sold to the conglomerate Genesco. Maxey Jarman, its president, recognized in Ms. Stutz an ability for merchandising and advertising, and named her to run the Henri Bendel store in 1957. ''Jarman had talked to her at great length about her vision for the store,'' Ms. Rosenberg said. ''It was not going to be a store for everybody.''         Bendel's was known at various times as a hat shop and as the source of the Duke of Windsor's wardrobe, but Ms. Stutz's concept was narrowly focused on a young, sophisticated urban woman, and she rarely ordered clothes larger than size 10. In an article in New York magazine in 1987, Ms. Stutz described her taste for what she called ''dog whistle'' fashion: ''clothes with a pitch so high and special that only the thinnest and most sophisticated women would hear their call.'' She was also one of the first retailers to consider merchandising food and furniture alongside fashion, and she made way for the in-store designer boutique in the late 1960's, as she did for Ms. Rykiel.         ''She recognized that fashion was more than just about clothing; it was about lifestyle and how one lives,'' said Joan Kaner, the fashion director of Neiman Marcus, who worked under Ms. Stutz from 1967 to 1976. ''She thought to put in perfumed candles and potpourri at the entrances so that when people walked in, they got this wonderful aroma. She was born with impeccable taste, and practically brought over every European designer who ever came to America.''         Ms. Stutz's Street of Shops replaced what was formerly a dimly lit floor with merchandise randomly displayed along a 100-foot corridor. She installed marble floors and boutiques, small shops within the larger store that changed each season, stocked with exclusive merchandise culled from markets around the world -- a flower shop, stationery, a tiny art gallery, tabletop items from Frank MacIntosh, Lee Bailey's home displays, and a boutique called ''Port of Call'' with objects from Vietnam and Thailand.         Ms. Rosenberg recalled her instructions to travel to Paris to explore the new market for ready-to-wear in 1959, when Ms. Stutz told her, ''Buy anything you want.''         ''It was a store that was edited like a magazine,'' Ms. Mirabella said. ''It was everybody's meeting place on Saturdays or at Christmastime.''         Ms. Stutz took the in-store-shop concept further in the late 1960's with boutiques dedicated to the collections of designers she felt could succeed with the store's support. Stephen Burrows opened his boutique there in 1969, an experience he recalled as a defining moment of his career (one he replicated in 2002 at Bendel's current site: 712 Fifth Avenue).         In 1980, Ms. Stutz assembled a team of investors and acquired the store from Genesco. Five years later she sold her interest, and worked as a publisher with Random House, overseeing books on Andy Warhol and Elsie de Wolfe. She also continued to consult with designers and retailers through a practice called GSG Group, which she founded in 1993.         Ms. Stutz's mid-1960's marriage to David Gibbs, an art dealer and painter, ended in divorce, her stepdaughter, Ms. Turner, said.         Robert Rufino, the vice president of creative services at Tiffany & Co., is one of the many retail executives who found their start with Ms. Stutz. He designed windows for the company in the 1970's, and recalled Ms. Stutz's ability to intermingle her interests in art and film with fashion.         ''In those days, there was nothing else like Henri Bendel,'' Mr. Rufino said. ''It was like working for the best house in the world. To take this little town house and make it look like someone lived there, as you were going from room to room -- it was just one woman's vision on the world of fashion, and yet it did incredibly well.''       
         Andrea Dworkin, the feminist writer and antipornography campaigner whose work was a lightning rod for the debate on pornography and censorship that raged through the United States in the 1980's, died on Saturday at her home in Washington. She was 58.         Ms. Dworkin died in her sleep, said her husband, John Stoltenberg. The cause of death had not been determined last night, but Mr. Stoltenberg said that Ms. Dworkin had suffered from several chronic illnesses in recent years.         With her unruly dark curls and denim overalls, Ms. Dworkin was for decades a visible presence on the lecture circuit, at antipornography rallies and ''take back the night'' marches. In speeches and in her many books, she returned vocally, passionately and seldom without controversy to the subjects of sex, sexuality and violence against women, themes that to her were inextricably and painfully linked.         Among her best-known books are ''Pornography: Men Possessing Women'' (Putnam/Perigee, 1981), ''Intercourse'' (Free Press, 1987) and ''Heartbreak: The Political Memoir of a Feminist Militant'' (Basic Books, 2002).         Reviewing ''Heartbreak'' in The New York Times Book Review, Laura Miller wrote: ''Dworkin is one of the few remaining specimens of pure countercultural Romanticism: fierce, melodramatic and utterly convinced that all truth can be found in her own roiling, untempered emotions.''         With her first book, ''Woman Hating'' (Dutton, 1974), Ms. Dworkin drew the lines in what she saw as a pitched battle against men's historical domination of women. She opposed all forms of pornography, which she believed incited violence against women. She was also critical of consensual sex between women and men, which she saw as an act of everyday subjugation in which women were accomplices.         ''One of the differences between marriage and prostitution is that in marriage you only have to make a deal with one man,'' Ms. Dworkin wrote in ''Letters From a War Zone'' (Dutton, 1989). Marriage, she added, ''is a legal license to rape.''         Andrea Rita Dworkin was born on Sept. 26, 1946, in Camden, N.J., and earned a bachelor's degree in literature from Bennington College in 1968. She later moved to Europe, where she married a Dutch political radical. The marriage was abusive, Ms. Dworkin said later, and she was divorced after three years.         ''I was a battered wife,'' she told The New York Times in 1985, ''and pornography entered into it. Both of us read it, and it helped give me the wrong idea of what a woman was supposed to be for a man.''         To Ms. Dworkin, it did not matter that some critics condemned her sweeping antipornography stance as a form of censorship. With the feminist lawyer Catharine A. MacKinnon, she wrote a municipal ordinance, briefly adopted by several cities in the 1980's, that defined pornography as a form of sex discrimination. (In 1986, the United States Supreme Court affirmed a lower court's ruling overturning the ordinance in Indianapolis.)         If Ms. Dworkin's work was unabashedly polemical, her life was full of nuanced contradictions. She publicly identified herself as a lesbian, speaking movingly about ''this love of women'' as ''the soil in which my life is rooted,'' and her work was a touchstone for many gay men and women. But in 1998, she married Mr. Stoltenberg, her companion of many years. A writer, editor and a founder of Men Against Pornography who also identifies himself as gay, Mr. Stoltenberg is her only immediate survivor.         Ms. Dworkin's other books include ''Scapegoat: The Jews, Israel and Women's Liberation'' (Free Press, 2000), ''Right-Wing Women'' (Coward, McCann & Geoghegan, 1983) and, with Ms. MacKinnon, ''Pornography and Civil Rights: A New Day for Women's Equality'' (Organizing Against Pornography, 1988). Ms. Dworkin also wrote two novels, ''Mercy'' (Four Walls Eight Windows, 1991), about serial rape, and ''Ice and Fire'' (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1987), about prostitution.         Though some critics dismissed her work as unreasoned diatribe, Ms. Dworkin remained an outspoken champion of the causes in which she believed.         ''I am not afraid of confrontation or risk,'' she wrote in ''Letters From a War Zone,'' ''also not of arrogance or error.''       
         Kay Gardella, a television critic and columnist for The Daily News who worked at that paper for nearly 60 years, died on Wednesday at Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 82.         The News, reporting her death, said she had been ill with cancer.         Ms. Gardella was born in Belleville, N.J., and graduated from the old Upsala College in East Orange. Two years later, in 1946, she took a job at The News as a copy girl and then became a writer covering crime and life style features.         She was named radio and television editor in 1975 and became the television critic in 1981 and a weekly columnist in 1993. Her last column appeared on March 19.         Ms. Gardella was married to Anthony Marino, a reporter and editor at The News who died several years ago. She leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Raisa Struchkova, one of the Soviet Union's leading ballerinas in the Bolshoi Ballet when that company first took audiences abroad by storm in the 1950's and 60's, died in Moscow on Monday, the Bolshoi Theater announced. She was 79 and lived in Moscow.         Ms. Struchkova was highly praised at home for her classical dancing, especially in ''Giselle'' and ''Cinderella.'' But for American audiences who were stunned by the athletic vigor of the Bolshoi at its New York debut in 1959, Ms. Struchkova will always be associated with the high-flying virtuosity that she showed in Soviet-style bravura duets with her husband, Aleksandr Lapauri.         Their signature piece in this genre was ''Moszkowski Waltz,'' choreographed by Assaf Messerer. Ms. Struchkova and Mr. Lapauri, dressed in white, wowed audiences with acrobatic lifts and tosses for the ballerina and then moved to opposite ends of the stage before she raced across and threw herself into her partner's arms. Even in the 1960's, when their performances were no longer a novelty, viewers in the Metropolitan Opera House sprang to their feet in a frenzy.         Yet Ms. Struchkova's main teacher at the Bolshoi school was Yelizaveta Gerdt, the epitome of refined classical style. After Mr. Lapauri died in 1975, Ms. Struchkova retired from dancing in 1978 and coached younger ballerinas, including Nina Ananiashvili, in the 19th-century classics.         The daughter of a factory worker, Ms. Struchkova was born in Moscow on Oct. 5, 1925, and graduated from the Bolshoi school in 1944. She joined the company that year. Already noticed for what Soviet critics called her femininity as well as her strong technique, she showed off a comic gift in her first major role as Lise in ''La Fille Mal Gardée'' in 1946. Although she was not the first ballerina to dance the title role in the Bolshoi's ''Cinderella,'' choreographed to Prokofiev's score by Rostislav Zakharov in 1945, she triumphed in the part in 1947 with the expressive simplicity of her portrayal. She never achieved the international superstar status of Galina Ulanova and Maya Plisetskaya at the Bolshoi. But ''Cinderella'' made her a star.         Possibly influenced by her bravura in the showpiece duets (which included another ''Waltz,'' to music by Dunievsky), some critics in the international ballet world considered Ms. Struchkova too much of a powerhouse performer to be a model in the classics. Yet she danced the leading roles in ''Swan Lake,'' ''The Sleeping Beauty,'' ''Giselle,'' ''Don Quixote,'' and ''The Nutcracker'' and in contemporary Soviet ballets, including ''Romeo and Juliet.'' The government awarded her the order of Lenin and named her People's Artist of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.         She taught ballet from 1962 at GITIS, the State Theatrical Institute of the Arts, and from 1978 was a ballet mistress and coach at the Bolshoi. From 1981 to 1995 she was the founding editor of the magazine Ballet, originally called Soviet Ballet.       
         Elizabeth McFarland Hoffman, who as poetry editor of Ladies' Home Journal sandwiched the work of W.H. Auden, Adrienne Rich and Sylvia Plath in between ''Is Your Marriage a Masquerade?'' and ''Bing Crosby's Kitchen for His Bride,'' died last Thursday in Philadelphia. She was 83 and had homes in Swarthmore, Pa., and Harborside, Me.         The cause was complications after cardiac surgery, her husband, Daniel Hoffman, said.         While Ms. Hoffman was at Ladies' Home Journal, from 1948 to 1962, the magazine published at least a half-dozen poems in each monthly issue. Major 20th-century writers whose verse appeared there included Marianne Moore, John Ciardi, Mark Van Doren, Randall Jarrell, Maxine Kumin, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Walter de la Mare, Galway Kinnell, Maxwell Anderson and John Updike.         Ms. Hoffman's own poems, published under her maiden name, also appeared in the magazine. She left Ladies' Home Journal in 1962, after its new owners stopped publishing poetry.         Elizabeth McFarland was born on May 3, 1922, in Harrisburg, Pa. As a teenager, she won a national poetry contest sponsored by Scholastic magazine; she later became Scholastic's poetry editor.         In 1948, she married Mr. Hoffman. He survives her, as do a son, MacFarlane Hoffman of Swarthmore; a daughter, Kate H. Siddiqi of Philadelphia; and two sisters, Nancy Ranew of Milton, Fla.; and Janice Volz of New York City.         The poems in Ladies' Home Journal were generally short, but Ms. Hoffman paid top rates: $10 a line. (In contrast, Poetry magazine paid 50 cents a line in the early 1950's, Mr. Hoffman, a prominent poet, said.)         Usually set in a box in the middle of a page, the poems created some arresting juxtapositions. In the August 1950 issue, ''Secrets,'' by Auden, follows an ad for Velveeta. In September 1956, ''Where the Bodies Break,'' by Mr. Kinnell, shares a page with ''How to Make 10 Tantalizing Butter Waffles With That Tender Melt-Away Texture.''         Readers of the June 1953 issue, which featured ''A Glass of Summer Daisies,'' by Jessamyn West, could, a page later, contemplate the question, ''Did you wake up today with 'morning mouth'?''         The magazine had a history of such juxtapositions. Under Edward Bok, a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer who edited Ladies' Home Journal from 1889 to 1919, it published fiction by Sarah Orne Jewett, Bret Harte and Rudyard Kipling alongside articles on childrearing, Jennifer Scanlon, the author of ''Inarticulate Longings: The Ladies' Home Journal, Gender, and the Promises of Consumer Culture'' (Routledge, 1995), said in a telephone interview yesterday.         In the 1950's, women's magazines were tantalizing readers with similar mixed signals. ''The message of the Ladies' Home Journal and magazines like that is, 'Hey, we're willing to acknowledge the choices that women have in life, but in the end, we will maintain that most women will choose home and family,''' Professor Scanlon, a historian at Bowdoin College, said. ''The magazines reveal the tensions, as well as the message, of conformity.''       
         Clare Lynch O'Brien, an author, editor and consultant to children's television, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 62.         The cause was breast cancer, her sister Eileen Lynch Sussan said.         Mrs. O'Brien was a senior children's editor at Random House and a longtime colleague of Fred Rogers, the children's television host. Together they wrote ''Mr. Rogers Talks With Families About Divorce.'' She was also a consultant for ''Big Blue Marble,'' a children's show on public television. She later worked as an interior designer.         Clare Lynch was born in Manhattan on April 23, 1943, and graduated from the State University of New York at Cortland in 1965. She married Richard F. O'Brien, an advertising executive, in 1973. They lived in Manhattan, Washington and Nantucket, Mass.         In addition to her husband and her sister Eileen, of Stamford, Conn., Mrs. O'Brien is survived by her daughter, Kate, of Nantucket; her son, Miles, of Cockeysville, Md.; her brothers Daniel Lynch of Richmond, Va., and Thomas Lynch, of Greenwich, Conn.; and three other sisters, Moira Crabtree of West Caldwell, N.J., Sheila Casey of Washington and Elizabeth Berman of Los Angeles.       
         Shana Alexander, a journalist and television personality best known as the liberal sparring partner of the conservative commentator James J. Kilpatrick on the television newsmagazine ''60 Minutes'' in the 1970's, died on Thursday in Hermosa Beach, Calif. She was 79 and had lived in Manhattan and Wainscott, N.Y., for many years.         The cause was cancer, her family said. She had been in an assisted living facility.         A former columnist for Newsweek and Life magazines, Ms. Alexander joined ''60 Minutes'' in 1975 as the liberal voice of its debate segment, ''Point/Counterpoint.'' Once a week for nearly five years, she and Mr. Kilpatrick, a columnist for The Washington Star, locked horns over some of the most divisive issues of the day, including drugs, women's liberation and the Vietnam War. ''60 Minutes'' dropped the segment in 1979.         Ms. Alexander also wrote several nonfiction books, including ''Anyone's Daughter'' (Viking, 1979), about Patty Hearst; ''Very Much a Lady: The Untold Story of Jean Harris and Dr. Herman Tarnower'' (Little, Brown, 1983); and ''When She Was Bad'' (Random House, 1990), about the Bess Myerson conspiracy trial.         In 1995, she published a memoir, ''Happy Days: My Mother, My Father, My Sister and Me'' (Doubleday), an account of her privileged but loveless childhood.         Shana Ager was born in Manhattan on Oct., 6, 1925. Her father, Milton Ager, was a successful Tin Pan Alley composer whose tunes included ''Ain't She Sweet'' and ''Happy Days Are Here Again,'' which became a Democratic Party anthem. Ms. Alexander's mother, Cecelia, was a film critic for Variety and the New York newspaper PM.         Shana and her younger sister spent their early childhood in the family's opulent home on West 57th Street. In later years, the family lived in a string of elegant hotels. Her parents numbered Irving Berlin, the Gershwin brothers and the Marx Brothers among their friends.         Ms. Alexander earned a bachelor's degree in anthropology from Vassar in 1945. While in college, she worked as a copy girl for PM and after graduating became a reporter there; her first assignment was to interview the stripper Gypsy Rose Lee. Ms. Alexander was later an entertainment editor at Flair magazine.         In 1951, Ms. Alexander was the first woman to be named a staff writer of Life. She wrote a regular column, The Feminine Eye, for the magazine from 1964 to 1969. From 1969 to 1971, she was the editor of McCall's magazine, the first woman in nearly half a century to hold the job.         Ms. Alexander joined ''60 Minutes'' on Jan. 5, 1975, replacing the journalist Nicholas von Hoffman. Though she and Mr. Kilpatrick were friends off camera, their on-camera arguments were so famously heated, and so exquisitely literate, that they were regularly parodied by ''Saturday Night Live'' in its mock newscast, ''Weekend Update.''         Playing a character modeled on Ms. Alexander, Jane Curtin would begin the segment with a stream of impassioned statements. Dan Aykroyd, as Mr. Kilpatrick's alter ego, would invariably retort, ''Jane, you ignorant slut.'' She would shoot back, ''Dan, you pompous ass.''         In the years after ''60 Minutes,'' Ms. Alexander turned to writing accounts of true crime, which often opened windows onto larger issues like sex roles and social class and, in some cases, onto Ms. Alexander's own life. In most of her books, the central figures were women whose lives of privilege had caused them little but sorrow.         Many reviewers praised Ms. Alexander's strong characterizations, eye for detail and ability to capture entire social milieus. But some critics took her to task for identifying with her subjects too strongly. Her biography of Jean S. Harris, convicted in 1981 in the shooting death of her lover, the diet doctor Herman Tarnower, is an impassioned portrait of Ms. Harris as the victim of a domineering man. Ms. Alexander later publicly supported clemency for Ms. Harris. (Ms. Harris's sentence was commuted in December 1992.)         If Ms. Alexander felt a kinship with her subjects, she had good reason: she too was reared in icy splendor, by a remote, glamorous mother. Reviewing her memoir, ''Happy Days,'' in The New York Times Book Review, Delia Ephron called it ''heartbreaking,'' adding: ''There is no physical cruelty in this tale, just the awesome power of withheld love.''         Ms. Alexander's two marriages ended in divorce. Her only child, Kathy, died in 1987 at the age of 25 in a fall from Ms. Alexander's Park Avenue apartment building, an apparent suicide. Ms. Alexander's sister, Laurel Bentley of Manhattan Beach, Calif., is her only immediate survivor.         Among Ms. Alexander's other books are ''Nutcracker: Money, Madness, Murder'' (Doubleday, 1985); ''The Pizza Connection: Lawyers, Money, Drugs, Mafia'' (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1988); ''Marking Time: Letters From Jean Harris to Shana Alexander'' (Scribner, 1991); and ''The Astonishing Elephant'' (Random House, 2000).         Though Ms. Alexander always considered herself a print journalist, it was her gleeful, if carefully scripted, battles with Mr. Kilpatrick that made her famous. ''Imagine having to explain the facts of life to Jack Kilpatrick on national TV,'' Ms. Alexander said in a 1976 segment on maternity leave.         And from Mr. Kilpatrick, in a 1977 broadcast: ''If ever I heard an oversimplified fairy tale of the last years in Vietnam, I just heard one from you.''         Their act, Ms. Alexander knew, had a time-honored antecedent. ''Unwittingly,'' she told Publishers Weekly in 1979, ''we have reinvented an ancient classical art form known as the 'Punch and Judy Show.'''       
         Nan Kempner, one of New York's most serene hostesses and clotheshorses, a glittering fixture at social events and fashion shows on both sides of the Atlantic for decades, died Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 74.         The cause was emphysema, said her husband, Thomas. A heavy smoker until about 10 years ago, she had been breathing with the aid of an oxygen tank.         As slim as a stalk of celery and, as she proudly acknowledged, ''possibly one of the first people to have plastic surgery,'' Mrs. Kempner was a member of fashion's Hall of Fame and a Park Avenue hostess whose table was considered one of the best in Manhattan.         An original ''social X-ray,'' the phrase coined by Tom Wolfe to describe the premier rich and thin socialites of the Upper East Side, she never hesitated to admit that she loved making an entrance, loved being noticed and loved being photographed. She was a tireless and in-demand guest at every A-list function she could squeeze into a schedule that included trips each year to London, Paris, Gstaad, Venice, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Vail and Nassau for couture shows, parties, skiing and sunning.         Mrs. Kempner was known for her self-deprecating sense of humor and for being one of the few women slender enough to look, and feel, comfortable on the ubiquitous narrow gilt chairs of the couture salons. But she never considered comfort a major factor. She was simply ''crazy'' about clothes, cheerfully describing herself as an insatiable shopper who spent ''more than I should, and less than I want.''         ''The best part of a party is getting dressed to go,'' she often said. When her children left the nest, she turned their rooms into walk-in closets.         She was born Nan Field Schlesinger in San Francisco on July 24, 1930. Her father, Albert Schlesinger, known as Speed, owned one of California's largest Ford dealerships, and her mother, Irma, was a woman her daughter called ''an extraordinary fashion plate, who cared terribly about how she looked and who started me in couture as a child.''         After graduating from the Hamlin School in San Francisco, Mrs. Kempner entered Connecticut College for Women, but left before graduation. During a junior year abroad, she studied at the Sorbonne and had what she called ''painting lessons'' with Fernand Léger.         ''He said I was a disgrace, that I had so little talent I should go back to San Francisco and stop wasting my parents' money,'' she recalled. ''It wasn't exactly endearing, but it was true.''         After working briefly as a volunteer at the San Francisco Museum of Art, she was married in 1952 to Thomas L. Kempner, chairman of Loeb Partners, the investment banking house, and a grandson of Carl M. Loeb, the founder and former head of the firm. In addition to her husband, she is survived by two sons, Thomas Kempner Jr. of Manhattan and James L. Kempner of Greenwich, Conn.; a daughter, Adeline Field Kempner of Manhattan; and six grandchildren.         Mrs. Kempner entertained in a duplex apartment whose rooms were lined with antique silk panels or hand-painted French wallpaper with a lush, intertwining floral design. There were two paintings by René Magritte, a couple of bronze bas-reliefs by Robert Graham and tables piled high with art books and ancient Chinese bric-a-brac. The apartment also housed a small gym, where Mrs. Kempner exercised relentlessly, keeping herself thin enough to slip into the mannequins' dresses -- garments worn once by models on runways -- that she bought at a discount in Paris, Milan and New York.         Although she bought clothes from many leading couturiers, she was said to own thousands of Yves Saint Laurent creations and told The Independent of London in a 1994 interview that she had missed only one of his last 63 shows. She relished the flights of imagination that a well-chosen outfit allowed.         ''I remember in the 70's,'' she told The Independent, ''our car would drop the kids off at school, then Tommy would pick me up, and he'd say, 'Now, who are we today?' and I'd be Pocahontas, Nanook of the North, I'd be -- God knows -- the River Boat Queen. It was such fun.''         In addition to buying, wearing and collecting clothes, many of which she donated to museums' costume institutes and various charities, Mrs. Kempner served on a number of charitable boards and benefit committees, gave occasional courses in couture at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and at New York University, and flirted with a number of other careers. In the 1960's, she was a special editor of Harper's Bazaar magazine; in the early 70's, she was a design consultant for Tiffany & Company; and in the 1980's, she was a correspondent for French Vogue.         In the late 90's, she became an international representative for Christie's, a job she defined as ''a shill to bring friends in.'' Her book of recipes and happenings, ''R.S.V.P.: Menus for Entertaining From People Who Really Know How,'' was published by Clarkson Potter in 2000, with the proceeds going to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.         In a 1999 article in Town & Country, Annette Tapert asked Mrs. Kempner how she would describe her look. ''Artificially relaxed,'' she responded. ''It takes a lot of work to look relaxed. I've always liked being noticed, and I work hard at it. I'll never forget one day when my son Jamie and I were walking down the street and he asked, 'Mummy, do you mind if I walk on the other side of the street?' And I said, 'Why?' and he said, 'Because people stare!' But frankly, I couldn't go mail a letter if I didn't feel I looked all right.''         Then again, she once said: ''I tell people all the time I want to be buried naked. I know there will be a store where I'm going.''       
         Mary Ann Malkin, a noted rare-book collector and editor who for nearly two decades helped run AB Bookman's Weekly, the well-thumbed bible of the rare- and secondhand-book business that inflamed and then often sated the acquisitive passions of book collectors around the world, died on Aug. 1 at her home in Manhattan. She was 92.         Mrs. Malkin apparently died in her sleep, said Eric Holzenberg, the director of the Grolier Club of New York, the bibliophilic organization, which announced the death.         Mrs. Malkin, who signed her many book reviews in the magazine with just her initials, was known to generations of rare-book dealers and collectors simply as Mam.         With her husband, Solomon, she ran AB, as it was fondly known in the trade, from 1953 to 1972. (The initials stood for Antiquarian Bookman, the journal's original title.) In later years, Mrs. Malkin became an internationally recognized rare-book collector, amassing a library of historical books on dance notation that is considered the finest in the world.         In the decades after World War II, the mail-order secondhand-book trade was a flourishing enterprise, and AB, founded in 1948, was its chief avenue of communication. Eagerly awaited, greedily pored over and tenderly dog-eared, the journal was almost certainly the only bound artifact that any of its 10,000 subscribers -- rare-book dealers, librarians and private collectors -- would have ever considered marking up.         For 19 years, the Malkins ran the magazine from an office in downtown Newark where every horizontal surface, and many not-quite-horizontal ones, boiled over with centuries of books, papers and pamphlets. Sol. Malkin, who with the typographic exactitude of a cataloguer always spelled his nickname with a period, was AB's owner, editor and publisher. Mrs. Malkin was the administrative assistant, copy editor, proofreader, book critic and maker of coffee, which, for Mr. Malkin, had to be several parts cognac.         Thick, digest-sized and printed on very cheap paper, AB offered trade news, gossip and articles about book collecting. But it was for the classified ads that the journal was prized. Through its Books Wanted and Books for Sale departments, AB united far-flung collectors with dealers around the world, any one of whom just might happen to have a long-sought title in stock. (''Wanted: Any books on horse named Cruiser by Rary, Brown or others, ca. 1870?'' a listing in the issue of Jan. 3, 1953, read.)         Some of the ads catered to highbrow tastes. In December 1953, a dealer in Milwaukee offered an early edition of Gertrude Stein's 1925 novel, ''The Making of Americans,'' signed by Alice B. Toklas, for $12.50.         Others spoke of baser needs. ''Wanted: Spicy pulps of the 30's. Pep, Ginger, Paris Nights, Spicy Detective, Tattle Tales, etc.,'' a 1965 ad read.         Still others were simply bewildering, like this one, from March 22, 1965: ''Wanted: Anything on 'raining' of unusual objects -- frogs, toads, fish, beads, etc. -- falling or 'raining' from the sky.''         Mary Ann O'Brian was born on March 13, 1913, in Altoona, Pa. She earned an undergraduate degree from Pennsylvania State University in 1937, married a professor and moved with him to New York. The marriage ended in divorce, and she took a secretarial job with R.R. Bowker, then the parent company of Publishers Weekly, the book-industry trade magazine.         In 1948, Bowker started publishing Antiquarian Bookman, which had begun as a column in Publishers Weekly, as a stand-alone magazine, with Mr. Malkin as editor. The Malkins married around this time. Mr. Malkin bought Antiquarian Bookman in 1953, changing its name in 1967.         Mr. Malkin, who sold AB in 1972, died in 1986. Faced with rising competition from online used-book sellers, the magazine ceased publication in 1999. Today the Web site abbookman.com, owned by Intergalactic Inc., an Arizona used-bookstore chain that bought the rights to the name, offers information for dealers and collectors but does not sell books directly.         Mrs. Malkin leaves no immediate survivors. Her collection of dance books is now housed at Penn State. The university is also the distributor of a book she wrote with several colleagues, ''Dancing by the Book: A Catalogue of Books, 1531-1804, in the Collection of Mary Ann O'Brian Malkin.'' Published privately in 2003, the book can be obtained in very clean copies, with hard covers (no dust jacket) and many handsome illustrations.       
         Mary Lee Settle, a master of historical fiction who recreated time and place with visceral, almost fanatical accuracy, died Tuesday at a hospice in Charlottesville, Va. She was 87 and made her home in Charlottesville.         The cause was lung cancer, said her son, Christopher Weathersbee.         Ms. Settle, who was a National Book Award winner and the author of the novels known as ''The Beulah Quintet,'' explained her research process in an introduction to ''O Beulah Land,'' the first in an interconnected five-book saga that spanned three centuries, from Cromwell's England to what Ms. Settle called ''the feudal coal culture'' of West Virginia, her native state.         To inform her book, she wrote, it was necessary to ''let the past become a present, let it fall beyond intelligence into reliving, which is true sensuous recall, where dreams come from with all their fears and future hopes of things long past.''         ''The Beulah Quintet'' novels, written between 1956 and 1982, were linked by an exploration of the ways American concepts of personal freedom evolved, and began with the journey of former English prisoners to West Virginia's Kanawha Valley (called Beulah in the novels). For instance, the plot of ''The Scapegoat'' (1980), the fourth volume, unfolds during a violent 1912 confrontation between miners and owners. The other books are ''Know Nothing'' (1960), ''Prisons'' (written in 1973, years after ''O Beulah Land,'' but labeled Book I because the action takes place earlier in history) and ''The Killing Ground'' (1982).         But Ms. Settle's work ranged far beyond her birthplace, geographically and otherwise. In 1978, she received the National Book Award for ''Blood Tie,'' the story of American and British expatriates in Turkey. She had been living there, well aware of the sociocultural influences that traveled both ways between natives and outsiders. Reviewing the novel in The New York Times, Anatole Broyard wrote that the American and British characters were ''like so many Typhoid Marys, carrying the disease of change, change as a fever, wherever they go.''         If Ms. Settle's work was never wildly fashionable -- possibly because ''I don't write about being vaguely unhappy in Connecticut,'' she once said -- that allowed it to age well.         In her historical novels, readers could be assured that the characters spoke pretty much the way people in their time and place spoke, or as close to it as was humanly possible to determine. Ms. Settle had been known to spend months on end reading letters and other accounts from the period she was researching without taking a single note. ''She believed that the key to understanding these people was in their words,'' said Starling Lawrence, her editor at W.W. Norton. So she simply immersed herself in them.         ''Ye're no more nor 19, if that,'' a character in ''O Beulah Land'' tells a new acquaintance. In ''I, Roger Williams: Fragment of an Autobiography'' (2001), Williams has low opinions of ''brabble'' and ''fribbling matters.''         Ms. Settle, always sympathetic to other writers and an advocate of their causes, decided that authors should have their own awards program, with the winners chosen by fellow authors. That way the selections would be independent of publishing industry influences. The idea turned into the PEN/Faulkner award, which began in 1980 and which, with a $15,000 grand prize, has become the largest of the country's major fiction awards.         Mary Lee Settle was born on July 29, 1918, in Charleston, W.Va., the daughter of Joseph Edward and Rachel Tompkins Settle. Her father was a civil engineer in charge of worker safety at coal mines. That industry ran into financial difficulties even before the Depression. More than a half century later, Ms. Settle recalled ''the brave Christmas dinner of 1930'' when she and her parents were living with her grandmother ''because the bottom had dropped out of the coal business.'' Ms. Settle attended Sweet Briar College in Virginia for two years, then began a career as a fashion model. ''I took for granted the kind of looks that other women envied and that I treated with a slight contempt,'' she wrote at the age of 69, contemplating the advisability of face-lifts. She is also said to have been given a screen test, along with half of Hollywood, for the role of Scarlett O'Hara in ''Gone With the Wind.''         During World War II she went to England and served in the women's branch of the Royal Air Force, an experience she recounted later in ''All the Brave Promises: Memories of Aircraft Woman Second Class 2146391.''         In New York after the war, she worked as a magazine editor, but briefly. She often told the story of how, while going over a Harper's Bazaar fashion layout that had been inspired by ''Wuthering Heights,'' she noticed in some notes that Emily Brontë had died at 30. It was then, she said, that she decided she had better start on the books she was planning to write, walked into the boss's office and resigned.         Nine years later her first book was published. ''The Love Eaters'' (1954) was about a small-town theater company. She went on to write 22 books, the most recent being ''Spanish Recognitions'' (2004), a travel memoir.         Ms. Settle traveled extensively and lived abroad at various periods in her life for various reasons. In the late 1960's she fulfilled a promise that many of her fellow Democrats had made to themselves. In 1987, she explained it to Nancy Carol Joyner of Western Carolina University: ''I said if Nixon was elected president I was going back to Europe. He was, and I did.''         Ms. Settle married three times and divorced twice. Her first two husbands, Rodney Weathersbee (1939-46) and Douglas Newton (1946-56), were British. In 1978, when she was 60, she married William L. Tazewell, an American writer and historian. He died in 1998.         Like many authors, she had an academic career as well. Her longest association was with Bard College, where she was an associate professor from 1965 to 1976. She also taught at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, where she lived on and off throughout her life.         Ms. Settle never let age slow her writing career. ''Spanish Reflections'' was based on a trip that she took in her early 80's, after finishing ''I, Roger Williams.''         At the time of her death she was working on ''Tom: An Appreciation of Thomas Jefferson,'' an ''imagined biography'' focusing on Jefferson's youth. Her son said it was not yet clear whether the book was in shape for publication.         In addition to her son, now living in Charlottesville, she is survived by a granddaughter, Beatrice Weathersbee, of Portsmouth, N.H.; a grandson, Nicolas Weathersbee, of St. Petersburg, Fla.; and four great-grandchildren.         Just days before her death, Ms. Settle discussed her memorial service with Mr. Lawrence, her editor. In a conversation that inspired her to give an impromptu recitation of a Keats sonnet (''When I have fears that I may cease to be''), she told him that she would like to have the beginning of the Gospel of St. John read. ''If you're a writer, you can see the appeal of that text,'' Mr. Lawrence said.         The first words of the first verse of the Book of John are ''In the beginning was the word.''       
         Nora Kerr, a longtime editor at The New York Times and a former editor of its Sunday Travel section, died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 61 and a Manhattan resident.         Ms. Kerr, who retired from the paper this month, died after having been ill with cancer for some years, her husband, Gordy Thompson, said.         Ms. Kerr joined The Times in 1976 as a copy editor; she was later editor of the paper's Westchester Weekly section and an assistant metropolitan editor. She was editor of the Travel section from 1986 to 1989, and was afterward an editor in The Times Magazine and the Arts & Leisure and Culture sections.         Nora Kerr was born on Nov. 19, 1943, in Cairo, where her parents had met during the war; the family later moved to New Jersey. She attended William Paterson College and Rutgers University and from 1967 to 1976 was a reporter and editor at The Bergen Record.         Ms. Kerr's first marriage ended in divorce. In addition to Mr. Thompson, a retired manager of Internet services at The Times, Ms. Kerr is survived by their son, Andrew Kerr-Thompson; her mother, Hermine, of Wayne, N.J.; and a sister, Jacqueline Kerr Harrold, of Benton, Pa.       
         Dr. Margot S. Kruskall, a Harvard hematologist and an expert on blood banks who was an early advocate for patients' donations of their own blood before surgery, a practice propelled by the spread of AIDS in the 1980's, died on Aug. 27 at her home in Dover, Mass. She was 56. The cause was ovarian cancer, her family said.         In 1982, when Dr. Kruskall headed Beth Israel Hospital's blood bank and hematology laboratory in Boston, she established a program for patients to donate and store their own blood, in large part stemming from concerns about hepatitis infections.         The practice, known as autologous donation, was known for more than a century, although it had never before been instituted on a wide scale. Dr. Kruskall and others at Beth Israel set up a system to label the blood, decided what surgical procedures were best served by it and created an inventory system.         The program's timing was propitious, coming just as H.I.V. was being recognized as a blood-borne virus.         When similar programs appeared nationwide, Dr. Kruskall and others analyzed their effectiveness and published the findings in the journal Transfusion in 1986. Autologous donations have since declined, largely because of closer controls on blood banks and the application of the hormone erythropoietin, which stimulates production of red blood cells and markedly reduces the need for blood transfusions.         Dr. Justine M. Carr, a hematologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and a former director of the hematology lab there, said Dr. Kruskall began to research the viability of erythropoietin in the 1980's, helping to prove its effectiveness and determine dosages.         She and other scientists later developed a blood test to detect erythropoietin, which has been used by athletes to reduce muscle fatigue and illicitly enhance performance.         More recently, Dr. Kruskall pursued research to develop a kind of universal red blood cell that could be safely infused, regardless of a patient's blood type. She worked with Type B blood, modifying its red cells with enzymes to react like the cells in blood Type O, which can be received by most patients.         Margot Sheffield Kruskall was born in New York City. She earned an undergraduate degree from Jackson College of Tufts University, and her medical degree from the Medical College of Wisconsin in 1974.         She arrived at Beth Israel in 1976 and remained for the rest of her career, ultimately serving as director of the division of laboratory and transfusion medicine. Harvard appointed her an associate professor of medicine in 1992 and a professor of pathology in 2002.         Dr. Kruskall was an associate editor of Transfusion.         She is survived by her husband of 32 years, Dr. Stephen Kruskall, co-chairman of the emergency room at MetroWest Medical Center in Framingham, Mass.; a son, Peter; two daughters, Gillian and Lauren, all of Dover; and by a sister, Denni Day of Rochester.       
         Enid A. Haupt, whose philanthropy benefited libraries, museums and hospitals but who devoted much of her considerable fortune to creating public gardens and preserving horticultural institutions, died on Tuesday at her home in Greenwich, Conn. She was 99, and also kept a residence in Manhattan.         Her death was announced by her niece Cynthia Hazen Polsky.         Mrs. Haupt was fond of saying that ''nature is my religion.'' For more than five decades her greatest pleasure was sharing that religion.         A principal beneficiary of this passion was the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. Over the years it received more than $34 million and will also receive a substantial gift from her estate. A major portion of her gift went to the resurrection of the garden's glass-domed Victorian conservatory, which by the 1970's had become a sodden and broken-paned ruin. The conservatory now bears her name.         ''People are refreshed, their minds are cleared, when they take a walk in a garden,'' she once said, explaining her interest in making public spaces beautiful. ''It's a marvelous escape from reality.''         Her other gifts were far-ranging and continuous. In the last 25 years alone they totaled more than $140 million, including $35 million to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She also endowed 10 faculty positions and had been an active member of the cancer center's Board of Overseers. Other beneficiaries included the Enid A. Haupt Garden at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, four acres of Victorian formal gardens, a section of which is entered through nine-foot-high moon gates, and another area with North African accents. In 1993, Mrs. Haupt donated 15 works of art, valued at more than $5 million, to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and, four years later, further works valued at $1.7 million, part of a total contribution of more than $13 million. A $1.5 million Haupt endowment maintains the gardens at the Cloisters in Upper Manhattan.         She also contributed $1 million to buy River Farm, a former home of George Washington in Alexandria, Va., for use as the national headquarters of the American Horticultural Society (with a stipulation that the 27 acres be open to the public). Another $1 million went to help the restoration of Bryant Park, adjoining the New York Public Library, once a haven for drug dealers and now a Midtown oasis. The library itself received more than $1.5 million, including $300,000 for a 1989 exhibition of flowers.         Mrs. Haupt's other important philanthropies included a multimillion-dollar gift to the Wildlife Conservation Society, some of which went to the restoration of Bronx Zoo Jungle World and some to an endowment fund for the project. She underwrote the Haupt Fountains on the Ellipse in Washington, between the White House and the Washington Monument. Other sizable contributions went to the restoration of the glass conservatory in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum and to the Enid A. Haupt Library Annex of the Horticultural Society of New York. There were also gifts to the Monet garden in Giverny, France, and the National Wildflower Research Center in Austin, Tex. A gift of Édouard Vuillard's ''Place Vintimille'' to the National Gallery of Art in Washington in 1998 was valued at $3.5 million.         A dreamer who was able to see many of her dreams take shape, she was also a realist, aware that even the best-laid plans require follow-up, and she devoted considerable time to the projects in which she took a particular interest. She was once asked how often the projects she supported ended up as she had visualized them. ''When they think I'll see it,'' she said.         Once committed to a project, she never wavered. When she wanted additional funds, she disposed of cherished possessions, seemingly without a qualm. Nineteen pieces from her collection of jewels brought more than $2 million at auction in the early 1970's. The money went immediately to her horticultural interests. In 1983, when she wanted $25 million to provide an ambulatory care center at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, she sold 15 of her French Impressionist paintings, including works by Gauguin, Cézanne, Renoir and van Gogh, to her brother, Walter H. Annenberg, the publisher, philanthropist and former ambassador to Britain. He died in 2002.         Mrs. Haupt was the fourth, and last surviving, of eight children of Sadie and Moses L. Annenberg, the publisher who founded Triangle Publications, whose holdings eventually included The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Philadelphia Daily News, The Daily Racing Form, TV Guide and radio and television stations. She was one of seven sisters, all of whom devoted much of their inherited wealth to public institutions.         Mrs. Haupt was married in 1936 to Ira Haupt, the founder and senior partner in a Wall Street securities concern, a marriage that lasted until Mr. Haupt's death in 1963. An earlier marriage to Norman Bensinger of Chicago, whom she had met while horseback riding, ended in divorce.         An intensely private woman -- Mrs. Haupt often wandered through the New York Botanical Garden when she felt there was little chance that she would be recognized -- she became less interested in the trappings of wealth as she grew older.         The gift that gave her the most satisfaction, she said, was one of her earliest and least heralded: the Enid A. Haupt Glass Garden, a playground for children who are patients at the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine at New York University Medical Center. In 1959, she enveloped the playground, which was almost immediately nicknamed the Garden of Enid, in a greenhouse with soft music and made it a serene wheelchair-accessible haven for patients of every age and for staff members and visitors. Almost $1 million was donated for an endowment to maintain it.         Enid Annenberg was born in Chicago on May 13, 1906, and grew up in Milwaukee, where she attended the German-English Academy, now the University School. The family later moved to Manhattan and then to Long Island, but Enid was sent away to school at Mount Ida Seminary in Newton, Mass.         Although she was brought up at a time when careers for women from affluent families were not common, she was, she said, ''very adventurous and curious about everything and very different from my sisters.'' One of her first jobs was at The Philadelphia Inquirer, part of her father's publishing empire. During World War II, she wrote and broadcast for the Office of War Information, coining such phrases as ''If you can shell a pea, you can pack a parachute.''         In 1954, she became the publisher of Seventeen, the magazine for teenage girls, owned at the time by the Annenberg family. A year later, she became its editor, and for 15 years she directed the magazine from a pink swiveled throne in a large office dominated by pink curtains and pink flowers. During part of her tenure at the magazine, she also wrote a syndicated column, ''Young Living.''         She also wrote four books on young living and etiquette, with advice on how to meet boys and, once met, what to do about kissing. She recommended art exhibitions as a fine place to meet young men and once met, dropping a casual remark to capture their interest. Her suggestions of casual remarks included, ''What's chiaroscuro?'' and ''Picasso's Blue Period, I believe.''         If chiaroscuro or Picasso led to kissing, there was further advice: ''Kiss him lightly on the lips but don't go into a frantic clutch -- tilt your face ever so slightly so that the noses won't bump.''         Her serious collecting of Impressionist art began during her marriage to Mr. Haupt. ''My husband was also very interested and he supplied the money,'' she said.         She also made major gifts to museums. Six bronze sculptures by Giacometti, a sculpture by Henry Moore and a painting by Mark Rothko were among 13 pieces she gave to the National Gallery of Art in 1977.         She traced her interest in horticulture to a pot of huge purple orchids displayed in a friend's house in Milwaukee when she was a child. Much later, when a business associate of Mr. Haupt asked what she wanted as a wedding present, she said orchids, and orchids she got -- 13 tubs of cymbidiums from England.       
         C. DeLores Tucker, an outspoken advocate for minority and women's rights who marched arm in arm with Martin Luther King Jr. at Selma, Ala., and campaigned against profanity-ridden rap music lyrics, died on Oct. 12 at a rehabilitation center in Philadelphia. She was 78.         Peter Bailey, editor of ''Vital Issues: The Journal of African-American Speeches,'' which Mrs. Tucker founded, confirmed her death.         When she was 16, Mrs. Tucker raised her voice from the back of a flatbed truck to protest a Philadelphia hotel's refusal to admit black athletes. She went on to become the highest-ranking black woman in any state government when she served as secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in the 1970's.         She started the first Commission on the Status of Women in Pennsylvania and helped found and led the National Political Congress of Black Women. She held leadership positions in the Democratic Party, the National Women's Caucus and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, among many other organizations.         Mrs. Tucker achieved perhaps her greatest fame in the 1990's when she campaigned against gangsta rap lyrics, calling them ''sleazy, pornographic smut.'' At one point, she bought 20 shares of Time-Warner stock and rose at an annual meeting to demand the company's leaders read aloud the lyrics on records one of their subsidiaries was selling. They declined.         In her zeal to fight gangsta rap, the fiercely partisan Democrat found herself allied with William J. Bennett, the conservative Republican who held top posts in the presidential administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush.         Despite having raised more than $1 million for the N.A.A.C.P. as a public speaker, she picketed the organization's Image Awards because the rapper Tupac Shakur had been nominated for one. At the time, he was accused of sexually assaulting a 20-year-old female fan in New York and with shooting two Atlanta police officers in a traffic dispute.         At her funeral on Oct. 21, former Vice President Al Gore, one of many political leaders in attendance, called Mrs. Tucker ''a four-star general in the battle for righteousness.''         Cynthia DeLores Nottage was born in Philadelphia on Oct. 4, 1927, as the 10th of 11 children of the Rev. Whitfield Nottage and the former Captilda Gardiner. The children were raised in a strict religious atmosphere, not allowed to dance, listen to music or date until they were 21.         Because her father refused to accept pay for his pastor posts, Mrs. Tucker's mother became an entrepreneur to feed the family. She founded an employment agency for Southern blacks who migrated northward for jobs, ran a grocery store and became a landlord. When Mrs. Tucker later inherited some of those properties, political opponents accused her of being a slumlord.         She attended Temple University but did not earn a degree. Her first involvement in civil rights came when she registered black voters for a Philadelphia mayoral campaign in 1950.         The next year, she married William Tucker, a real estate executive, who is her only immediate survivor. They had no children but helped raise a number of relatives in their extended families.         In the 1960's, she campaigned for black candidates, served on the Pennsylvania Democratic Committee and earned a reputation as an excellent fund-raiser. She was the first black and the first woman elected to the Philadelphia Zoning Board. In 1971, Gov. Milton J. Shapp appointed her secretary of the commonwealth, equivalent to secretary of state in other states.         As secretary, she was a leader in instituting voter registration by mail and lowering the voting age to 18. Governor Shapp fired her in 1977 because of accusations that she used state employees to write speeches for which she was paid $66,931.         She ran unsuccessfully for Congress, lieutenant governor and the United States Senate.         Her involvement with gangsta rap began when a niece she was raising was ostracized for using foul language she had picked up from listening to the music. Music industry executives responded by suing her, and much of her later life was tangled in complicated suits and countersuits.         In 1997, she sued the estate of Mr. Shakur, who was shot to death the year before, for $10 million, alleging defamation for mentioning her in an obscene lyric. The suit was dismissed.       
         Hermine Braunsteiner Ryan was a Queens homemaker in 1964 when The New York Times revealed her notorious past as a vicious Nazi death camp guard.         Nearly a decade later, she became the first United States citizen to be extradited for war crimes. She was sent to West Germany, where she was tried, convicted and sentenced to life in prison.         That was in 1981, and little has been written about her since, although a German newspaper took note of her release, for health reasons, in 1996.         It turns out that she died three years later, on April 19, 1999, at the age of 79.         Her death appears to have gone unrecorded by American newspapers and magazines, although it is noted on the Internet encyclopedia Wikipedia and in a footnote in a 2005 memoir, ''Omaha Blues,'' by Joseph Lelyveld, a former executive editor of The Times, who recounts his experience as the young reporter who knocked on the door of the Ryan home more than 40 years ago.         Official word of Mrs. Ryan's death came in recent weeks from the Simon Wiesenthal Center's office in Israel, in response to questions by another Times reporter who was researching an article on the former Maidanek death camp in Poland, where Mrs. Ryan was once assigned.         Efraim Zuroff, director of the Israeli center, said he believed the death had been noted in some German papers. He said he did not know the cause, but in 1996, when the German government pardoned her from her life sentence, she suffered from diabetes and had had a leg amputated.         Dr. Zuroff said Mrs. Ryan's extradition and conviction were among the few successful legal actions against Nazis in the United States before the Justice Department Office of Special Investigations was established in 1979.         At the time she was discovered, Mrs. Ryan was living as the wife of an electrical construction worker in Maspeth, where she was known for her scrupulous housecleaning and friendly manner. When she was fighting deportation in 1972, The Times quoted neighbors saying her gruesome past was impossible for them to believe.         Survivors of the Maidanek concentration and death camp, near Lublin, told of her whipping women to death, seizing children by the hair and throwing them on trucks to take them to the gas chamber, kicking away a stool to hang a young girl, and stomping old women to death with her jackboots, among other cruelties. Her nickname was the Stomping Mare.         In her five-and-a-half-year trial by a West German court, which ended in mid-1981, Mrs. Ryan was convicted of just two murders. The deaths of possible witnesses and fading memories may have weakened the prosecution's case on other counts. Also, rules limited convictions to individual crimes actually witnessed.         Hermine Braunsteiner was born in Vienna on July 16, 1919. Her father was a butcher and not involved in politics. She received a strict Roman Catholic education and first wanted to be a nurse.         She instead worked in a brewery and as a household servant before going to work at the Heinkel Aircraft Works in Berlin, where she adopted the Nazi ideology. She applied to work at the Ravensbrück women's concentration camp in part to get more pay, starting in 1939.         In October 1942, she was transferred to Maidanek and promoted to assistant warden. She became known for whipping women for not sewing on their prison numbers correctly.         In 1944 she was sent back to Ravensbrück to lead a work detail. She had risen to supervising warden when the Soviet Army approached the camp. She fled to Vienna before the Soviet soldiers liberated the camp on July 23, 1944.         In 1946, she was arrested in Austria and handed over to Allied authorities, who shuffled her between internment and prisoner-of-war camps. In 1949 Austrian authorities again arrested her, and this time tried her.         She was convicted of assassination, infanticide and manslaughter at Ravensbrück in 1941 and 1942. Maidanek was barely mentioned.         Mrs. Ryan was sentenced to three years in prison, but was released early, in 1950. The Austrian government promised not to charge her with any additional crimes and granted her amnesty.         She then worked at hotels and restaurants, and met Russell Ryan, described in various sources as an American soldier or an American construction worker in Germany. In 1958, they moved to Nova Scotia, marrying in October of that year.         In April 1959, they moved to Queens, and she became an American citizen in January 1963.         Simon Wiesenthal, the Nazi hunter, who died in September, wrote in ''Justice Not Vengeance'' (1989) that he was approached in January 1964 in the Cafe Royal in Tel Aviv by three survivors of Maidanek. They told him about the cruel guard called Kobyla, the Polish word for mare.         One of his aides went to Vienna and discovered from her friends that she was in Halifax. Mr. Wiesenthal learned from a friend in Toronto that she had moved to Queens and got the address. The Nazi hunter then told the Vienna correspondent of The Times this information.         Mr. Lelyveld, as a young reporter, was assigned to check out the tip, but wrote that he was not given a specific address. He knocked on many doors of Queens residents with the last name Ryan.         On July 14, 1964, Mr. Lelyveld wrote that Mrs. Ryan readily acknowledged that she was Hermine Braunsteiner of Maidanek. She protested that she had already been punished in Austria, and said she was sick in the infirmary for much of the time she was assigned to Maidanek. Her husband told the reporter that he did not know she was a prison guard until Mr. Lelyveld informed him.         ''This is the end of everything for me,'' Mrs. Ryan said.         In 1971, she was stripped of her citizenship because she had concealed her criminal conviction from American immigration authorities. Germany and Poland then applied for her extradition.         She feared going to Poland, but said she was agreeable to going to West Germany. In August 1973, Mrs. Ryan was expelled from the United States. Her trial in Düsseldorf began in November 1975. With the many witnesses and procedural delays, it did not end until mid-1981.         Mr. Lelyveld wrote that in prison, Mrs. Ryan refused to speak to other inmates and liked to sew dolls and soft toys. When she was released, she went to a nursing home in Bochum-Linden where her husband lived.         A German weekly, Süddeutsche Zeitung Magazin, wrote of the couple in 1996, saying he had been seen pushing her through the market in a wheelchair, and asking her if she would like a bouquet of flowers. She did not respond. He looked at his watch and pushed on. Nothing is known of him now.         Correction:  December 10, 2005, Saturday  An article on the obituary page on Dec. 2 about Hermine Braunsteiner Ryan, a Queens homemaker who had once been a Nazi death camp guard, referred incompletely to the coverage of her death, in 1999. Although her death appears to have gone unrecorded at the time in the United States, it was noted in passing by some newspapers -- including The Daily News and Newsday -- in their obituary coverage, in September, of Simon Wiesenthal, the Nazi hunter who tracked her down.       
         Rona Jaffe, the preternaturally youthful writer whose 1958 novel ''The Best of Everything'' told the melodramatic story of four nubile, cashmere-sweatered career girls torn between storybook romance and cutthroat corporate Manhattan, died yesterday at University College Hospital in London, where she was on vacation. She was 74.         She died of cancer, said Alan C. Rothfeld, her lawyer and longtime friend.         Essentially commissioned by the movie producer Jerry Wald, Ms. Jaffe was a 25-year-old former associate editor in publishing when she sat down to write a book that Mr. Wald could turn into a blockbuster feature like ''Kitty Foyle: The Natural History of a Woman,'' a 1940 film that won Ginger Rogers an Academy Award for playing a plucky working girl who finds love, heartache, an unwanted pregnancy and, finally, romantic redemption. Published by Simon & Schuster, ''The Best of Everything,'' which drew on Ms. Jaffe's four-year employment at Fawcett Publications, as well as the experiences of close friends, was the urban answer to ''Peyton Place,'' Grace Metalious's risqué novel of lust in small-town America, which had been published two years earlier.         Ms. Jaffe's beautiful heroines -- Caroline, April, Barbara and Gregg -- toil as stenographers but are distracted by men, most of them cads, not to mention a lecherous boss called Mr. Shalimar. As Martin Levin of The New York Times wrote in a review of the book: ''Before very many coffee breaks one is a stretcher case, one is pregnant and the third is off to Las Vegas with a notorious lounge lizard. But that's the life of a working girl, at least as seen through Miss Jaffe's wide eyes.''         Critics howled, but America was entranced, which is precisely what its editor, Robert Gottlieb, was sure would happen. ''It was a basic story -- three or four or five girls start off together, one finds love, one goes crazy and/or dies, and one of them becomes a huge success -- but Rona's take was very up-to-date,'' Mr. Gottlieb said last night in a telephone interview. ''What made it work for the time was that it had a fresh young-career-women-in-New York quality with a fillip of shock.''         The synergy of its canny packaging as a book written expressly for Hollywood production was equally shocking at the time. Within two weeks of publication, the book was on the New York Times best-seller list, where it stayed for five months.         Less than a year later, thanks to Jerry Wald's involvement, ''The Best of Everything'' was released as a chic but heavy-handed film by 20th Century Fox and the director Jean Negulesco. The heroines' work site, Fabian Publishing, was set in the brand-new Seagram Building, and some of the sets were designed in seeming homage to a hot New York society decorator of the moment, Michael Greer. In a review of the movie's release on DVD last summer, Amy Nicholson of the Web site digsmagazine.com described its melodramatic, nail-biting charms as best accompanied by ''bonbons, chilled blush wine and possibly an emergency hanky.''         Hope Lange, Diane Baker, Martha Hyer and the 1950's supermodel Suzy Parker starred as the young women about town. Joan Crawford made a special appearance as Amanda Farrow, an ill-tempered book editor who, the film makes pointedly clear, has sacrificed personal happiness for professional glory. But it was Ms. Jaffe who went in a relative nobody and came back a star.         Born in 1931 in Brooklyn, Ms. Jaffe grew up in posh circumstances on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, the only child of Samuel Jaffe, an elementary-school principal, and his first wife, Diana, a high-strung socialite who had an independent fortune and a suburban estate in Connecticut. Her maternal grandfather was Moses Ginsberg, a millionaire construction magnate who built the Carlyle hotel.         Unlike her rather passive fictional characters, however, the tough-talking Ms. Jaffe was professionally ambitious and openly spoke of her desire to be a success. After graduating from the Dalton School at 15 and Radcliffe College four years later, she became a file clerk at Fawcett, eventually becoming an associate editor before leaving to write ''The Best of Everything.''         Like many of her characters, she had numerous romantic adventures, including a relationship with an Astor real estate heir. Ms. Jaffe did not, however, ever marry, preferring to avoid what she once dismissively described as ''the rat race to the altar.'' She leaves no survivors.         In the decades that followed ''The Best of Everything,'' Ms. Jaffe wrote 15 more popular books, several of which used the quartet-of-women narrative approach, including ''The Last Chance,'' a 1976 novel that one reviewer described as ''best devoured alone in bed, with a container of yogurt,'' and ''Class Reunion,'' a sudsy 1979 novel about three decades in the lives of four Radcliffe classmates, one of whom has a gay husband. Her last book was ''The Room-Mating Season,'' published in 2003. Mr. Gottlieb said he believed that her finest work was ''Mr. Right Is Dead,'' a 1965 collection of short stories and the title novella, about a call girl.         In her later years, Ms. Jaffe established herself as a patron of the arts. In 1995, she established the Rona Jaffe Foundation, which provides grants to emerging female writers. ''All writers need support, but many women in early career have fewer resources available to them and often many demands made upon them,'' Ms. Jaffe said in September at an awards ceremony. ''It gives me great pleasure to help some of them make their way at this early stage.''       
         Leona Nevler, a prominent book editor who 50 years ago helped secure the publication of a first novel set in an imaginary town called Peyton Place, died on Saturday at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. She was 79 and had homes in Manhattan and Westport, Conn.         The cause was a pulmonary embolism after surgery, her daughter, Ellen J. Silberman, said.         At her death, Ms. Nevler was a senior editor at Berkley Books, an imprint of the Penguin Group. For much of her career she was an executive at Fawcett Books.         Known primarily for publishing paperbacks, Ms. Nevler handled the work of many prominent writers, among them John Updike, Margaret Atwood, Jane Smiley, P. D. James, Dick Francis, James A. Michener, Jeffrey Archer, Amy Tan and Fannie Flagg.         Leona Joan Nevler was born in Lynn, Mass., and earned a bachelor's degree in English from Boston University in 1947.         Her first publishing job was with Little, Brown, followed, in the mid-1950's, by a stint as a manuscript reader for Lippincott. She joined Fawcett in 1955.         While reading for Lippincott, Ms. Nevler was sent the draft of a novel by a New Hampshire housewife named Grace Metalious. Originally titled ''The Tree and the Blossom,'' it chronicled the dark sexual underside of a picture-postcard New England town.         The book had far too much steam for Lippincott, as Ms. Nevler knew. She recommended it instead to Kathryn G. Messner, who ran Julian Messner, an independent publishing house in New York. Ms. Messner snapped it up, asking Ms. Nevler to help edit the manuscript as a freelance.         Published in 1956, ''Peyton Place'' went on to sell more than 10 million copies and spawn several movies and a television series. The title became a catchphrase for suburban dysfunction.         At Fawcett, Ms. Nevler helped start the Crest Books reprint line and held various editorial positions, eventually becoming vice president and publisher of Fawcett Books.         She left in 1981 and moved to Ballantine Books, which had acquired the Fawcett list.         She retired from Ballantine in 2001 as a senior vice president and editorial director.         Ms. Nevler's marriage to James H. Silberman ended in divorce. Besides her daughter, of Newton, Mass., she is survived by a son, Michael Silberman, of Montclair, N.J.; a sister, Alberta N. Grossman of Manhattan and Westport; and four grandchildren.       
         Selma Jeanne Cohen, a historian, editor and teacher who devoted her career to proclaiming dance an art worthy of the same scholarly respect traditionally awarded to painting, music and literature, died on Friday at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 85.         The cause was complications from Alzheimer's disease, said Leslie Steinau, her lawyer and a longtime friend.         Ms. Cohen waged a tireless campaign against scholars who maintained that dance was inherently frivolous. Instead, she believed it had a rich history that could be fruitfully analyzed from many philosophical viewpoints. Her efforts led her to become America's leading figure in dance scholarship.         Her most ambitious achievement was her editing of The International Encyclopedia of Dance for Oxford University Press. Published in 1998 after two decades of planning, and encompassing all forms of dance, the six-volume work, modeled on The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, remains the most comprehensive guide of its kind.         Eclectic scholarly interests had prompted Ms. Cohen, A. J.Pischl and Sheppard Black in 1959 to found Dance Perspectives, a journal dedicated to monographs on various aspects of world dance. Ms. Cohen became its sole editor in 1966. After it ceased publication in 1976, the Dance Perspectives Foundation, which she had established, continued to award an annual prize for the best dance book of the year.         Ms. Cohen was born in Chicago, attended elementary and high school at the University of Chicago Laboratory School and went on to the university itself, receiving a Ph.D. in English in 1946.         When a childhood friend started taking ballet lessons from Edna McRae, a respected Chicago teacher, Ms. Cohen went along. Ms. Cohen soon realized she had no dancing talent. But she had great curiosity, and McRae had a dance library, which Ms. Cohen devoured.         She began teaching English at the University of California at Los Angeles in 1946 and, at the same time, worked with the Los Angeles teacher and choreographer Eugene Loring. After moving to New York in 1953, she devoted herself to dance and started reviewing for Dance Observer. From 1955 to 1958 she was a dance critic at The New York Times, where she assisted John Martin, who was chief dance critic. She was dance critic for The Saturday Review in 1965 and 1966.         Ms. Cohen was a member of the first National Endowment for the Arts Dance Panel in 1966; organized a critics' conference at the American Dance Festival in New London, Conn., in 1970; and taught over the years at many colleges, including the University of Chicago, where she returned to head summer seminars from 1974 to 1976. Ms. Cohen wrote and edited several important books, among them ''The Modern Dance: Seven Statements of Belief'' (Wesleyan University Press, 1966), an anthology of essays by contemporary choreographers; ''Doris Humphrey: An Artist First'' (Wesleyan, 1972), a biography of a pioneering modern dancer; and ''Next Week, Swan Lake'' (Wesleyan, 1982), a study of dance aesthetics. Her ''Dance as a Theater Art'' (Dodd, Mead, 1974), a history of dance since the Renaissance, remains a popular college text.         Ms. Cohen, a tiny soft-spoken woman, could be a rigorous teacher, but she delighted in presiding graciously over social events. Friends, colleagues and students often met informally at her apartment, gatherings usually graced by Giselle, her long-lived and much-pampered cat. Ms. Cohen often jokingly said she hoped to write a treatise on feline aesthetics someday.         No immediate family members survive.
