         Sandra Dee, the perennially perky, blond-haired and blue-eyed actress who helped American teenagers of the late 1950's and early 1960's cope with the frustrations of adolescent romance and the temptations of premarital sex, died yesterday at the Los Robles Hospital and Medical Center in Thousand Oaks, Calif. She was 62.         The cause of the death was complications from kidney disease, said Steve Blauner, a family friend.         Ms. Dee was probably best remembered for her portrayal of Gidget, a tomboyish California teenager who discovered the joys of surfing and boys in Paul Wendkos's 1959 film of the same name. The bright, chirpy Ms. Dee defined a new kind of natural, sun-soaked innocence that America, and much of the rest of the world, quickly embraced as the radiantly healthy, outdoorsy essence of Southern California living.         In 1960 she married the singer Bobby Darin, her costar in the 1961 romantic comedy ''Come September,'' after a whirlwind courtship. The story of her marriage to Darin, whom she divorced in 1967 and who himself died in 1973 at the age of 37, was chronicled in Kevin Spacey's recent theatrical film ''Beyond the Sea,'' in which Mr. Spacey played Darin and Ms. Dee was played by Kate Bosworth.         Ms. Dee followed ''Gidget'' with Delmer Daves's film ''A Summer Place'' (1959), in which she was paired with Troy Donohue as teenage lovers whose innocent confusion about how far their relationship should go ran up against the hypocrisy of an adult world -- a hypocrisy vividly embodied by their adulterous parents, played by Richard Egan and Dorothy McGuire. A tremendous commercial success, ''A Summer Place'' was among the earliest studio films to commodify youthful rebelliousness, though Ms. Dee was hardly an icon of adolescent revolt with her shiny helmet of flipped hair and color-coordinated outfits.         Born Alexandra Zuck on April 23, 1942, in Bayonne, N.J., she began modeling in New York at an early age. Appearances in television commercials led her to Hollywood, where she made her film debut in Robert Wise's 1957 ''Until They Sail.'' Her first substantial role came in Vincent Minnelli's romantic comedy ''The Reluctant Debutante'' (1958), in which she played the American-raised daughter of the Londoners Rex Harrison and Kay Kendall.         Ms. Dee soon proved to be as at home in melodrama as in comedy. She moved to Universal for Helmut Kautner's ''Restless Years,'' portraying the illegitimate daughter of a neurotic woman (Teresa Wright) trapped in a stifling small town. She remained at Universal for what was probably her finest sustained performance in certainly the most important of all her films, Douglas Sirk's grandly Brechtian soap opera ''Imitation of Life'' (1959).         Playing the neglected daughter of a driven, manipulative Broadway star (Lana Turner), Ms. Dee projected a genuinely touching fragility, and convincingly turned on her uncaring mother in one notable scene. ''Imitation of Life'' was Universal's biggest success of the 1950's, and prompted the studio to reunite Ms. Dee and Turner in the garish crime thriller ''Portrait in Black.''         Although Universal kept pushing her into teenage roles --as the barefoot, backwoods heroine of ''Tammy, Tell Me True'' (1961) and ''Tammy and the Doctor'' (1963, opposite an equally innocent young Peter Fonda) -- her widely publicized marriage to Darin made her seem less acceptable as an adolescent. In addition to ''Come September,'' Ms. Dee starred with her finger-snapping husband as a jealous young wife in ''If a Man Answers'' (1962) and as a maid posing as a successful publisher in ''That Funny Feeling'' (1965). In between, however, Ms. Dee returned to teenage roles, playing James Stewart's peacenik daughter in ''Take Her, She's Mine'' (1963).         After her troubled marriage to Darin came to an end, Ms. Dee seemed to lose interest in her acting career. Growing too old to play the perfect teenager (as she did again in the 1967 ''Rosie!''), she failed to make a convincing transition to adult roles, and soon she was appearing in small parts on television series. Her last starring role was in the low-budget film ''The Dunwich Horror'' (1970).         Ms. Dee is survived by her son, Dodd Darin, and two granddaughters. In 1994, Mr. Darin published, with Maxine Paetro, ''Dream Lovers: The Magnificent Shattered Lives of Bobby Darin and Sandra Dee,'' an account of his parents' relationship.         Correction:  February 23, 2005, Wednesday  An obituary of the actress Sandra Dee on Monday misspelled the surname of her co-star in ''A Summer Place'' and misstated the color of her eyes. The co-star was Troy Donahue, not Donohue, and her eyes were brown, not blue.       
         Uli Derickson, the Trans World Airlines flight attendant honored for saving passengers' lives in 1985 by both confronting and mollifying terrorist hijackers, died on Friday at her home in Tucson. She was 60.         Ms. Derickson was still working as a flight attendant for Delta Air Lines when she received a diagnosis of cancer in 2003, her son, Matthew Derickson, said in announcing her death.         On June 14, 1985, when a pair of Lebanese gunmen commandeered a T.W.A. flight from Athens to Rome, Ms. Derickson took the lead in protecting the 152 passengers and crew members.         Though the two hijackers spoke almost no English, Ms. Derickson was able to speak with one of them in German and occasionally calm him by singing a German ballad he requested. She won the hijackers' pity for one passenger by explaining that his daughter had been delivered by a Lebanese doctor.         She also intervened during beatings, often putting herself in harm's way.         ''Don't you hit that person,'' she would shout, a passenger later told The New York Times. ''Why do you have to hit those people?''         When a ground crew in Algiers refused to refuel the plane without payment, even when faced with the terrorists' threat to kill passengers, it occurred to Ms. Derickson to offer her Shell credit card. The ground crew charged about $5,500 for 6,000 gallons of fuel.         The most terrifying moment for her, she later told Glamour Magazine, was when the crueler of the two hijackers asked her to marry him.         At one point they asked Ms. Derickson to sort through the passengers' passports to single out people with Jewish-sounding names. Although various news organizations initially reported that she had followed their orders, she in fact hid the passports, her son said. ''Everybody looked to her for courage and guidance,'' Tom Cullins, an architect in Burlington, Vt., who was a hostage on the plane, said in an interview yesterday. ''She was clearly in control. She even made demands of the hijackers.''         Mr. Cullins added, ''We have nothing but the utmost respect for her and a debt of gratitude for really heroic acts.''         After about 36 hours, the terrorists released a second wave of hostages, including Ms. Derickson and 65 others, in Algiers. They had already killed a Navy diver, Robert D. Stethem, but his was to be the only death. The hijackers released other hostages over the next 15 days, with the ordeal ending for the last 39 on June 30. It ended after Israel's release of 31 Lebanese prisoners, a fraction of the 766 the hijackers had demanded.         Ms. Derickson became the first woman to receive the Silver Cross for Valor, awarded by the Legion of Valor, a veterans organization. ''The Taking of Flight 847: The Uli Derickson Story,'' a 1988 movie that appeared on NBC and featured Lindsay Wagner as Ms. Derickson, received five Emmy nominations.         Ulrike Patzelt was born on Aug. 8, 1944, in Aussig an der Elbe, Czechoslovakia, near the German border, and was raised in Bavaria. She worked as an au pair in Britain and Switzerland before immigrating to Connecticut in 1967.         She began working for T.W.A. a few years later and joined Delta in the early 1990's.         Her husband, Russell G. Derickson, a former pilot, died in 2003. She is survived by her son, of San Diego, and her mother, Marianne Patzelt of Nuremberg, Germany.       
         Beverly Dennis, an actress who played on Broadway, in films and television, most notably on CBS as Red Buttons's wife on ''The Red Buttons Show'' until she was blacklisted in the 1950's, died on Jan. 20 at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 79.         The cause was multiple myeloma, her daughter, Amanda Kramer, said.         Ms. Dennis was summoned to Hollywood in 1951 by the director William A. Wellman, who cast her as a lead in ''Westward the Women,'' written by Frank Capra and starring Robert Taylor.         She had met Mr. Buttons at the Actors Studio when the two auditioned unsuccessfully for parts in Tennessee Williams's play ''Camino Real.'' She lost her role as Mr. Buttons's wife in 1952 after the publication ''Red Channels: The Report of Communist Influence in Radio and Television'' (1950) listed her as belonging to ''subversive organizations,'' probably because she ''signed a few petitions like the rest of us,'' her friend the actress Lee Grant said.         Ms. Dennis was born Beverly Maxine Omensky in Rahway, N.J., on Dec. 12, 1925, the older of two daughters of Charles Omensky, who ran a bar and restaurant, and Marion Mintz Omensky. She grew up in Chicago, where she acted in the theater as a child and briefly attended the University of Chicago.         In 1944 she married Russell Dennis, an actor who was also later blacklisted and then became a medical doctor. He died in 1963. In 1967 she married Jerry Kramer, a businessman, who died in 1983. Her only survivor is her daughter, a musician, singer and composer who plays keyboard in the group the Psychedelic Furs.         After losing her role on ''The Red Buttons Show,'' Ms. Dennis appeared in 1953 in a successful revival of ''Charley's Aunt'' directed by José Ferrer, and continued to support herself doing television commercials. But she decided to switch her profession to psychotherapy, and attended New York University for her bachelor's degree and Columbia University for a master's.         In 1977 she moved her practice to Beverly Hills, where her patients included studio heads, directors, screenwriters and performers. According to her friend the writer Ann Louise Bardach, ''She even turned important people down for treatment because, as she said, 'You can't change character.'''         Correction:  March 5, 2005, Saturday  An obituary on Feb. 14 about Beverly Dennis, an actress who was largely barred from work during the anti-Communist campaigns of the 1950's, misidentified a source of allegations against her. Although she was suspected of Communist sympathies, her name did not appear in ''Red Channels: The Report of Communist Influence in Radio and Television,'' published in 1950.       
         Elsa H. Zion, a city official and former publishing executive who campaigned successfully to regulate the workload of interns and residents in New York State's hospitals after the highly publicized death of her daughter, Libby, in 1984, died on Thursday at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. She was 70 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was complications of breast cancer, said her husband, the journalist Sidney Zion.         For a decade, until shortly before her death, Ms. Zion was the deputy director of the Bureau of Senior Services, Resources and Partnerships at the New York City Department for the Aging. She was previously an assistant to Andrew J. Stein, then the City Council president.         Libby Zion was 18 when she died in New York Hospital on March 5, 1984, having been admitted eight hours earlier with a high fever. In 1987, a grand jury report cited errors that it said could have contributed to her death. These included being given a painkiller that can interact lethally with the antidepressant drug that she had told doctors she was taking and remaining unmonitored by a doctor for four hours, during which time her temperature rose to 108 degrees. The hospital admitted in 1987 that it had failed to provide adequate care for her, and the State Department of Health fined it $13,000.         After her death, the Zions pushed for limitations on the number of hours medical interns and residents could work each week, and in 1989, New York State adopted regulations limiting interns' and residents' hours and increasing their supervision by senior doctors.         In 1995, a jury in a negligence suit brought by the Zions against the hospital and the doctors who treated their daughter found that an intern and two other doctors had contributed to her death. The jury absolved the hospital of wrongdoing.         Elsa Ruth Heister was born in Winthrop, N.Y., on Feb. 24, 1935. She earned a bachelor's degree from Bard College and a master's in library science from the University of Chicago. In the 1970's and early 80's, she was president of Transworld Feature Syndicate.         Besides her husband, a columnist for The Daily News, Ms. Zion is survived by two sisters, Sandra, of San Francisco, and Martha, of Miami; two brothers, Karl, of Portland, Me., and Robert, of Miami; two sons, Adam, of Brooklyn, and Jed, of Manhattan; and two grandchildren.       
         Dr. Georgeanna S. Jones, who was half of a husband-and-wife team that created the first program for in vitro fertilization in the United States and its first ''test tube'' baby, died on Saturday at a hospital in Norfolk, Va. She was 92 and lived in Portsmouth, Va.         The cause was cardiac arrest, said her husband, Dr. Howard W. Jones.         Dr. Georgeanna Jones, one of the country's first reproductive endocrinologists, was a quiet leader in her field for four decades at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, where she taught and conducted research. But she unwittingly stepped into the national spotlight when she and her husband, a gynecological surgeon, moved to Eastern Virginia Medical School in 1978 and set out to open a clinic that would allow conception outside a mother's body.         The first in vitro baby was born that same year, in England, but the procedure had never been accomplished in the United States. After three years and fierce denunciation from opponents who raised moral and ethical questions, Dr. Jones and her husband announced the birth of Elizabeth J. Carr on Dec. 28, 1981. Just slightly underweight at 5 pounds 12 ounces, Elizabeth was the first American ''test-tube baby.''         ''It was a major development, which essentially allowed I.V.F. to develop and flourish in the United States,'' said Dr. Zev Rosenwaks, who trained under the Joneses and directs the Center for Reproductive Medicine and Infertility at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell.         The news quickly led to a flood of attention, kindling hope in infertile couples around the country and prompting many doctors to converge on Norfolk to learn the procedure. More than 114,000 babies have since been born through in vitro fertilization in the United States, about 3,000 of them at the clinic in Norfolk now called the Jones Institute for Reproductive Medicine.         ''Literally right after they succeeded, every doctor interested in the field marched through Norfolk,'' said Sherry Sontag, the author of a coming book, ''One in a Million: A History of I.V.F. and the Quest to Make One Tiny Baby.'' ''They trained many of today's leading experts, and those they didn't train were taught by their students.''         Dr. Jones is widely credited with inspiring generations of women in medicine. She lectured, wrote some 350 scientific articles and worked closely with many of the patients at her clinic. Slowly progressing Alzheimer's disease restricted her in the 1990's, but she kept an office at the institute and never lost touch with the first crop of children whose lives began in her laboratory.         ''I always joked that they were like my second set of grandparents,'' said Ms. Carr, who is 23 now and lives in St. Petersburg, Fla., working as an online reporter for the Poynter Institute. ''They would call me every Christmas and birthday. For a while, all of the I.V.F. babies born at the clinic would travel down there for Mother's Day reunions. We all feel like brothers and sisters.''         Ms. Carr says she wears a silver pendant, engraved with her initials and the number one, given to her by the Joneses.         Born in Baltimore on July 6, 1912, Georgeanna Seegar earned her undergraduate degree from Goucher College there and her medical degree from Johns Hopkins. She was the daughter of an obstetrician, Dr. J. King Seegar, who also delivered her future husband.         In 1939, while at Johns Hopkins, Dr. Jones helped establish and lead the first division of reproductive medicine in the country. Several decades later, she identified a disorder, called luteal phase defect, that causes deficiencies in the hormone progesterone and sometimes leads to miscarriages.         In 1978, Dr. Jones and her husband left Johns Hopkins for Eastern Virginia Medical School shortly after the birth of the world's first in vitro baby was announced in England. The couple had not intended to open a clinic until a former patient of Dr. Georgeanna Jones, after reading about the birth, sent the Joneses a grant for $5,000 and encouraged them to do the same. They agreed, but almost backed out when opponents questioned whether the procedure would lead to selective breeding and the destruction of embryos.         ''We only went ahead with it because the board of trustees at the medical school said, 'We're behind you, go ahead,''' Dr. Howard Jones said yesterday.         Within a year of Elizabeth Carr's birth, the Joneses had helped deliver about 10 more in vitro babies.         ''Despite the controversy,'' said Ms. Sontag, the writer, ''Georgeanna never lost sight of the fact that the most important part about I.V.F. was making babies.''         In addition to her husband of 64 years, Dr. Jones is survived by two sons, Dr. Howard Wilbur Jones III of Nashville and Lawrence Massey Jones of Denver; a daughter, Dr. Georgeanna Jones Klingensmith of Denver; a brother, King Seegar of Towson, Md.; a sister, Elizabeth Seegar of Silver Spring, Md.; seven grandchildren; and one great-grandson.       
         Maria Schell, an Austrian actress who achieved international fame in Hollywood and became a major star of German-language films, died on Tuesday at her home in Preitenegg, Austria. She was 79.         The cause was heart failure, the mayor of Preitenegg, Franz Kogler, told the German news agency Deutsche Presse-Agentur.         Before she went to Hollywood in the 1950's, Ms. Schell, who was sometimes called ''the blond angel,'' was already a celebrated film figure in Austria, Germany and Switzerland, where she was often typecast as a charming girl from the Alps.         Ms. Schell was named best actress at the Cannes film festival in 1954 for her portrayal of a young doctor in ''Die Letzte Brücke'' (''The Last Bridge'') and became internationally known for her role as Grushenka in ''The Brothers Karamazov'' in 1958.         She also appeared in several American movies alongside actors like Gary Cooper, in ''The Hanging Tree'' in 1959, and Marlon Brando, in ''Superman'' in 1978.         Ms. Schell made more than 200 film and television appearances, mostly in German. She was also a prominent stage actress in Austria and Germany.         She was born in Vienna on Jan. 15, 1926, the daughter of a Swiss writer and an Austrian actress. She grew up with three siblings who all went into acting, including Maximilian, her younger brother by four years, who also became a star. In 1938, the family moved to Switzerland, where, in 1942, at the age of 16, she appeared in her first film, the Swiss ''Der Steinbruch'' (''The Quarry'').         Even though her debut was not very successful, Ms. Schell decided to study drama in Zurich. She did not make another movie until she starred in Karl Hartl's Austrian-German 1948 production ''Der Engel mit der Posaune'' (''The Angel With the Trumpet''), the first film to bring her recognition abroad.         In 2002, Ms. Schell made her last public appearance at a presentation of ''Meine Schwester Maria'' (''My Sister Maria''), Maximilian's documentary about her life.         The Austrian film critic Alexander Horwath said she was ''one of the very few stars of postwar German-speaking cinema who had a lasting impact on the international film scene,'' Agence France-Presse reported.         Ms. Schell's two marriages ended in divorce. Her first husband was the film director Horst Hächler. Her second marriage, to the Austrian actor Veit Relin, ended after 22 years in 1988. In her last years, Ms. Schell suffered several strokes and led a secluded life at her home in the Alps.         Survivors include Maximilian; her son, Oliver, from her first marriage; and her daughter, Marie-Theres, from her second marriage.       
         Shana Alexander, a journalist and television personality best known as the liberal sparring partner of the conservative commentator James J. Kilpatrick on the television newsmagazine ''60 Minutes'' in the 1970's, died on Thursday in Hermosa Beach, Calif. She was 79 and had lived in Manhattan and Wainscott, N.Y., for many years.         The cause was cancer, her family said. She had been in an assisted living facility.         A former columnist for Newsweek and Life magazines, Ms. Alexander joined ''60 Minutes'' in 1975 as the liberal voice of its debate segment, ''Point/Counterpoint.'' Once a week for nearly five years, she and Mr. Kilpatrick, a columnist for The Washington Star, locked horns over some of the most divisive issues of the day, including drugs, women's liberation and the Vietnam War. ''60 Minutes'' dropped the segment in 1979.         Ms. Alexander also wrote several nonfiction books, including ''Anyone's Daughter'' (Viking, 1979), about Patty Hearst; ''Very Much a Lady: The Untold Story of Jean Harris and Dr. Herman Tarnower'' (Little, Brown, 1983); and ''When She Was Bad'' (Random House, 1990), about the Bess Myerson conspiracy trial.         In 1995, she published a memoir, ''Happy Days: My Mother, My Father, My Sister and Me'' (Doubleday), an account of her privileged but loveless childhood.         Shana Ager was born in Manhattan on Oct., 6, 1925. Her father, Milton Ager, was a successful Tin Pan Alley composer whose tunes included ''Ain't She Sweet'' and ''Happy Days Are Here Again,'' which became a Democratic Party anthem. Ms. Alexander's mother, Cecelia, was a film critic for Variety and the New York newspaper PM.         Shana and her younger sister spent their early childhood in the family's opulent home on West 57th Street. In later years, the family lived in a string of elegant hotels. Her parents numbered Irving Berlin, the Gershwin brothers and the Marx Brothers among their friends.         Ms. Alexander earned a bachelor's degree in anthropology from Vassar in 1945. While in college, she worked as a copy girl for PM and after graduating became a reporter there; her first assignment was to interview the stripper Gypsy Rose Lee. Ms. Alexander was later an entertainment editor at Flair magazine.         In 1951, Ms. Alexander was the first woman to be named a staff writer of Life. She wrote a regular column, The Feminine Eye, for the magazine from 1964 to 1969. From 1969 to 1971, she was the editor of McCall's magazine, the first woman in nearly half a century to hold the job.         Ms. Alexander joined ''60 Minutes'' on Jan. 5, 1975, replacing the journalist Nicholas von Hoffman. Though she and Mr. Kilpatrick were friends off camera, their on-camera arguments were so famously heated, and so exquisitely literate, that they were regularly parodied by ''Saturday Night Live'' in its mock newscast, ''Weekend Update.''         Playing a character modeled on Ms. Alexander, Jane Curtin would begin the segment with a stream of impassioned statements. Dan Aykroyd, as Mr. Kilpatrick's alter ego, would invariably retort, ''Jane, you ignorant slut.'' She would shoot back, ''Dan, you pompous ass.''         In the years after ''60 Minutes,'' Ms. Alexander turned to writing accounts of true crime, which often opened windows onto larger issues like sex roles and social class and, in some cases, onto Ms. Alexander's own life. In most of her books, the central figures were women whose lives of privilege had caused them little but sorrow.         Many reviewers praised Ms. Alexander's strong characterizations, eye for detail and ability to capture entire social milieus. But some critics took her to task for identifying with her subjects too strongly. Her biography of Jean S. Harris, convicted in 1981 in the shooting death of her lover, the diet doctor Herman Tarnower, is an impassioned portrait of Ms. Harris as the victim of a domineering man. Ms. Alexander later publicly supported clemency for Ms. Harris. (Ms. Harris's sentence was commuted in December 1992.)         If Ms. Alexander felt a kinship with her subjects, she had good reason: she too was reared in icy splendor, by a remote, glamorous mother. Reviewing her memoir, ''Happy Days,'' in The New York Times Book Review, Delia Ephron called it ''heartbreaking,'' adding: ''There is no physical cruelty in this tale, just the awesome power of withheld love.''         Ms. Alexander's two marriages ended in divorce. Her only child, Kathy, died in 1987 at the age of 25 in a fall from Ms. Alexander's Park Avenue apartment building, an apparent suicide. Ms. Alexander's sister, Laurel Bentley of Manhattan Beach, Calif., is her only immediate survivor.         Among Ms. Alexander's other books are ''Nutcracker: Money, Madness, Murder'' (Doubleday, 1985); ''The Pizza Connection: Lawyers, Money, Drugs, Mafia'' (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1988); ''Marking Time: Letters From Jean Harris to Shana Alexander'' (Scribner, 1991); and ''The Astonishing Elephant'' (Random House, 2000).         Though Ms. Alexander always considered herself a print journalist, it was her gleeful, if carefully scripted, battles with Mr. Kilpatrick that made her famous. ''Imagine having to explain the facts of life to Jack Kilpatrick on national TV,'' Ms. Alexander said in a 1976 segment on maternity leave.         And from Mr. Kilpatrick, in a 1977 broadcast: ''If ever I heard an oversimplified fairy tale of the last years in Vietnam, I just heard one from you.''         Their act, Ms. Alexander knew, had a time-honored antecedent. ''Unwittingly,'' she told Publishers Weekly in 1979, ''we have reinvented an ancient classical art form known as the 'Punch and Judy Show.'''       
         Dame Cicely Saunders, a founder of the modern hospice movement, died July 14 in the prototype she had built in Britain 38 years ago, St. Christopher's in Sydenham, south London. She was 87.         Her death was reported on the hospice's Web site.         European hospices go back to the Middle Ages, when they sheltered, comforted and entertained wayfarers -- pilgrims, minstrels, crusading knights. Dame Cicely, a medical doctor, played a major role in reinventing them as last way stations for the terminally ill, offering palliative care and, if possible, peace of mind before a death without needless pain.         She founded the hospice at St. Christopher's in 1967 and made it the kernel of a movement that she helped spread in the United States and worldwide. Its purpose was to complement pain and symptom control with compassionate care.         Now caring for more than 2,000 patients and their families a year, St. Christopher's has inspired about 240 other hospices in Britain alone and many others around the world. It supports hospice care in developing countries and shares expertise through international partnerships and extensive education, training and research programs. Over the years it has trained some 50,000 doctors, nurses and other professionals and helped establish palliative care for those with terminal illnesses as a medical discipline.         Dame Cicely was St. Christopher's medical director from its founding in 1967 until 1985, then served as chairwoman till 2000, when she took the title of president.         Her travels in the United States greatly encouraged the movement here, said Patricia Farrington, director of the Pax Christi Hospice program at St. Vincent Catholic Medical Centers in New York.         ''She came to us in the early 60's and met with people here who became hospice founders and pioneers,'' she said. ''She came to New York, Los Angeles and Boston and Yale, and met with people who had corresponded with her and were impressed with her passion, that it was the obligation of health-care providers to relieve suffering.''         Dame Cicely's first book, ''Care of the Dying,'' was published in 1960. She wrote and edited textbooks and guides for laymen bracing for a death in the family. Among the titles were ''Living with Dying'' (1983) ; ''Management of Terminal Malignant Disease'' (Oxford, third edition, 1993), written with Nigel Sykes; and ''Living With Dying: A Guide to Palliative Care'' (third edition, 1995), to which she contributed.         She received more than a score of honorary degrees and was made a Dame Commander of the British Empire in 1980. She was awarded Britain's Order of Merit in 1989.         Cicely Mary Strode Saunders was born into a well-to-do family on June 22, 1918, in Barnet, in north London. She set out to study politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford, but with the war she turned to tending to the ill and wounded. She graduated as a Red Cross war nurse from the Nightingale Training School in 1944 and worked in many hospital departments.         Returning to St. Anne's College at Oxford, she studied to become a medical social worker, or what the British then called a lady almoner. She trained at a cancer hospital and, having joined the staff, developed a rapport with patients. Talking with them, she saw the need for better-rounded care of those near the end.         She entered St. Thomas's Hospital Medical School, became a doctor in 1957 and, as a researcher in pharmacology, worked on handling pain. She sought a way to avoid large dosages of medications like morphine by giving low dosages regularly, allowing the patient to stay alert.         As early as 1959 she presented her ideas for a holistic hospice in a paper titled ''The Need'' that drew contrasts with prevailing treatments of the terminally ill. In another paper, ''The Scheme,'' she outlined a plan for a 100-bed home.         Dame Cicely, a Christian, included a chapel and provided for prayer time but made it clear that religion, even when proffered tactfully, was no substitute for clean, well-lighted rooms, a comfortable day room, a homelike setting and a caring staff.         The home within a hospital that she had envisioned, St. Christopher's Hospice, finally opened in 1967 after she led a fund-raising campaign for it.         ''I didn't set out to change the world, I set out to do something about pain,'' Dame Cicely said in a 2002 interview with The Daily Telegraph of London. ''It wasn't long before I realized that pain wasn't only physical, but it was psychological and spiritual.''         In 1980, Dame Cicely married Marian Bohusz-Szyszko, a Polish artist. He died in her care at St. Christopher's in 1995.       
         The Rev. Mother Benedict Duss, who in the late 1940's helped found the first monastery for cloistered Benedictine nuns in the United States but stepped down as its abbess in 1995 amid a Vatican investigation into charges that it was being run in an authoritarian, cultlike manner, died Oct. 2 at the Abbey of Regina Laudis in Bethlehem, Conn. She was 94.         The death was confirmed by Sister Angèle Arbib, a spokeswoman for the abbey. At her death, Mother Benedict was abbess emerita there.         An American who trained as a surgeon in France before World War II, Mother Benedict helped found the abbey in 1947. Situated on 400 acres, it is home to a contemplative community of 37 women who farm, run a dairy and practice traditional crafts like weaving, bookbinding and ironworking.         The community, whose name is Latin for Queen of Praise, follows the Benedictine principles of prayer, hospitality and stewardship of the land. It is also famous for perpetuating the sacred tradition of Gregorian chant, which the women of Regina Laudis sing seven times daily and once each night. The abbey has released two recordings on compact disc, ''Women in Chant'' (1996) and ''Recordáre'' (2000), and a textbook, ''A Gregorian Chant Master Class'' (2002).         Mother Benedict's efforts to start the abbey inspired a popular Hollywood movie, ''Come to the Stable'' (1949). With a script by Clare Boothe Luce, the film stars Loretta Young and Celeste Holm as two young nuns trying to build a children's hospital.         Mother Benedict was born Vera Duss on Nov. 21, 1910, in Pittsburgh. When she was 3, she and her brother moved with their mother to France. In 1936, she earned a medical degree from the University of Paris. That year, she entered Notre Dame de Jouarre, a Benedictine abbey outside Paris, taking the name Sister Benedict.         During the war, she quietly continued her work as a community doctor. With Nazi officers occupying the abbey, she spent days living in near seclusion in its bell tower to escape their notice. After Allied forces liberated the abbey in August 1944, she resolved to start a Benedictine community in the United States. In 1946, she arrived in New York with Mother Mary Aline Trilles de Warren, a French nun.         The women started the Regina Laudis monastery in an abandoned factory on land donated by a Connecticut industrialist. In 1976, the Vatican elevated the monastery to an abbey; Mother Benedict was named its first abbess.         In the early 1990's, the Vatican began investigating accusations that Mother Benedict and the Rev. Francis J. Prokes, a longtime spiritual adviser to Regina Laudis, were running the abbey in a manner some critics described as cultlike.         The abbey made no public comment on the charges at the time and, through Sister Angèle, declined to comment last week.         In 1994, Father Prokes was removed as the community's spiritual adviser. ''That was a discernment of Rome, and this community has the greatest respect for that discernment,'' Sister Angèle said in a telephone interview last week.         The next year, Mother Benedict stepped down from the day-to-day administration of the abbey, becoming abbess emerita, Sister Angèle said.         Mother Benedict, who continued to live at the abbey until her death, leaves no immediate survivors.
