         Nell Carter, the robustly sassy singer and actress who exploded onto the New York musical stage in the Fats Waller revue ''Ain't Misbehavin' '' and went on to become a popular television star in the series ''Gimme a Break!,'' died yesterday at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 54.         Ms. Carter collapsed and was found by one of her sons, said her spokesman, Roger Lane. She had been in rehearsals for ''Raisin,'' a musical adaptation of the play ''A Raisin in the Sun,'' at a theater in Long Beach, Calif. A diabetic, Ms. Carter survived two brain aneurysms in 1992.         Although she stood only 4 feet 11 inches tall, she was a larger-than-life stage personality who never did things in half-measures. Along with Patti La Belle and Jennifer Holliday, she belonged to a select circle of theatrical pop-soul belters whose members reveled in high-powered vocal flamboyance. A typical performance by Ms. Carter reached into the fabric of a song and tore out its seams with feral flourishes.         As a singer and stage personality, Ms. Carter was also a natural comedian. Her vocal style was descended from the humorous gutbucket blues of Bessie Smith by way of Dinah Washington, whose singing also conveyed a seam of earthy amusement. The warmth and feeling for comedy that inflected her interpretations of even the saddest songs reflected Ms. Carter's desire to be what she called ''Judy Garland without the tragedy.''         For many, Ms. Carter's performances of songs like ''Honeysuckle Rose'' and ''Mean to Me'' were legendary. That show, a potpourri of mostly Fats Waller pieces, opened at the Manhattan Theater Club in February 1978, and moved to the Longacre Theater on Broadway three months later, running there for more than 1,600 performances. Ms. Carter won a Tony for best featured actress in that musical.         Three years later she won an Emmy for the NBC television production of the same show. Ms. Carter made such an indelible impression as a shimmying, bawdy old-time vaudevillian in ''Ain't Misbehavin' '' that she often found herself typecast as a rollicking good-time mama.         Her biggest success after ''Ain't Misbehavin' '' was the sitcom ''Gimme a Break!,'' in which she played Miss Nellie Ruth ''Nell'' Harper, the housekeeper and surrogate mother for a widowed California police chief and his three children. The show, which ran from 1981 to 1987, earned her two Emmy nominations and revived the archetype of the mammy, an African-American woman caring for a white family.         Nell Carter was born Nell Hardy in Birmingham, Ala., on Sept. 13, 1948. While growing up, she absorbed her mother's recordings of Dinah Washington and B. B. King, along with her brother's Elvis Presley records. As a child, she sang on the gospel circuit and performed on a weekly radio show, ''The Y Teens.'' Later she sang in local coffeehouses.         Moving to New York at 19, she studied acting and performed in nightclubs like Reno Sweeney, the Village Gate, Dangerfield's, the Apartment and the Rainbow Room. ''Ain't Misbehavin' '' was the springboard to a wide-ranging singing and acting career.         Her television credits ranged from a role on the soap opera ''Ryan's Hope'' to an appearance on the acclaimed PBS special ''Baryshnikov on Broadway'' to game-show contestant on ''Match Game.'' Her theater credits include ''Hello Dolly!,'' ''Hair,'' ''Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope,'' ''Jesus Christ Superstar'' and ''Bubbling Brown Sugar.''         She had film roles in ''The Grass Harp'' (1995) and ''The Proprietor'' (1996).         Married and divorced twice, Ms. Carter is survived by a daughter, Tracy, and by two sons, Joshua and Daniel.       
         Mary Ellis, the young opera singer for whom Rudolf Friml wrote ''Rose-Marie'' in 1924 and who later became the queen of musicals in London, died there on Thursday at her home on Eaton Square. She was 105, including the three years that Hollywood publicists subtracted in the 1930's.         Her title role in the operetta ''Rose-Marie,'' her first venture into musical theater, was one of the biggest Broadway hits of the 1920's, running for 558 performances. Arthur Hammerstein, the producer, ordered it written especially for her, and long before Jeanette MacDonald's hit version of ''Indian Love Call'' from the 1936 film adaptation, critics universally hailed Miss Ellis's highly trained singing.         Her dramatic career lasted until she was 97, although she appeared exclusively in England after the 1930's, partly because of a breach with Hammerstein that kept her permanently off the American musical stage.         Her London stage consort, the composer and actor Ivor Novello, a leading rival of Noël Coward, called her his inspiration and built several hits around her. She also had a major London success with Jerome Kern's ''Music in the Air.''         Miss Ellis's glamorous circle included Fred and Adele Astaire, Harpo Marx and George Gershwin, with whom she fell fruitlessly in love. In her Hollywood career, Fritz Lang and Marlene Dietrich were her great friends. Her personal life was chronicled, husband by husband, in the press. ''We were all mad and in love with life and work, and each other,'' she wrote in her autobiography, ''Those Dancing Years'' (John Murray, 1982).         Miss Ellis was born May Belle Elsas on June 15, 1897, at 131 West 95th Street in Manhattan. Her name, considered too German sounding, was changed when she joined the Metropolitan Opera.         Her father, who had arrived from Germany with only a few coins in his pocket, eventually became president of Consolidated Paper Mills. Her mother showed promise as a concert pianist before her marriage.         Miss Ellis's parents wanted her to be a painter, but after hearing Geraldine Farrar sing, she once said, ''there was nothing in my mind but opera.''         At 18, she signed a four-year contract with the Met. She had important roles, including Mityl in the premiere of Albert Wolff's ''Blue Bird.'' She sang a minor part with Enrico Caruso in one of his last performances, in Donizetti's ''Elisir d'Amore,'' in Brooklyn in 1920.         Against all advice, she left the Met to act in Shakespearean productions on Broadway for the actor and producer David Belasco. That work led to ''Rose-Marie,'' originally about a sweet French-Canadian girl and her love for a fur trapper wrongly accused of murder. (The Canadian mountie, a minor role in the stage version, became the love interest in the movie, in which he was personified by Nelson Eddy.)         Miss Ellis left the show after a year to appear in ''The Dybbuk,'' a dramatic production at the Neighborhood Playhouse on the Lower East Side, where she happily traded a weekly paycheck of $500 for one of $10. Arthur Hammerstein was furious and forced her to sign an agreement preventing her from singing for any management but his. She never sang onstage in the United States again.         Miss Ellis had already been divorced twice when she began appearing with Basil Sydney, an English matinee idol, in productions that included a long-running modern-dress version of ''The Taming of the Shrew. They married on a whim in 1929.         There were professional tensions between the two, some caused by the offers she received to act in plays and films for which her husband was turned down. They appeared together in many plays in London until their marriage collapsed in a highly public divorce. But she was always busy with her own career, including a deal to make three pictures for Paramount.         Though her movies, including ''All the King's Horses'' (1934), were considered mediocre at best, her own acting and singing voice drew praise. Graham Greene lamented ''the waste of her sensuous appeal, her Bacchanalian gleam'' in that film.         She also appeared successfully in dramas, like the London production of ''Strange Interlude'' in 1931. But her greatest fame was in musicals, and by the late 1930's, she was one of the most popular stars of the West End, appearing in shows created by Novello and in costumes by Cecil Beaton. Some of the shows Novello wrote for her included ''Glamorous Night'' and ''The Dancing Years.''         During World War II, Miss Ellis spent three years working as an ambulance driver and a practical nurse. She went on to win excellent reviews for a string of postwar roles, including a leading part in Terence Rattigan's hit drama ''The Browning Version.''         She retired from the stage in 1970 but continued to act on television and in radio plays. Her last role, in 1994, was in the Sherlock Holmes television series starring Jeremy Brett.         Miss Ellis leaves no immediate survivors. Her last husband was Jock Muir Stewart Robinson, whom she married in 1938 after a hectic courtship. He was an enthusiastic pilot, skier and climber, and although she hated mountain climbing, she willingly accompanied him. He died in a climbing accident in 1950. She never married again.       
         Fedora Barbieri, a dramatic mezzo-soprano celebrated for Verdi interpretations that were extensively preserved on records and film, died on Tuesday in Florence, Italy. She was 82.         Gifted with a large, opulent voice, Miss Barbieri was of the same generation of opera stars as Cesare Siepi, Giuseppe di Stefano, Boris Christoff and Jussi Bjorling. A favorite with European audiences from the 1940's on, she later won acclaim in New York, particularly for her appearances as Azucena in ''Il Trovatore,'' Amneris in ''Aida,'' Adalgisa in Bellini's ''Norma,'' and in the Verdi Requiem.         Her 1950 New York debut itself entered opera history, coming on the night Rudolf Bing first faced his audience as the general manager of the Metropolitan Opera. He opened an era with a boldly ambitious revival of ''Don Carlo,'' in which Miss Barbieri sang the role of Princess Eboli.         The Immigration and Naturalization Service had turned Bing's entire inaugural season into a cliffhanger days before the curtain rose on it. Acting under the 1950 Internal Security Act, it confined shiploads of arriving aliens on Ellis Island on the grounds that they could be threats to the United States; Miss Barbieri, Christoff and Zinka Milanov were among them.         Miss Barbieri's offense was attending school in Fascist wartime Italy, a circumstance that she stated in her visa application. She and the other soloists were freed just in time for the show to go on.         Miss Barbieri, Mr. Bjorling (in the title role) and Mr. Siepi, making his debut as Philip II, appeared in what Olin Downes of The New York Times described as an occasion that revealed afresh ''the melodic opulence and dramatic power of Verdi's genius.'' Miss Barbieri, he said, was a ''superb mezzo from Italy, with a kindling dramatic temperament.''         Fedora Barbieri was born in Trieste, Italy, and as a girl she helped out in her parents' shop. Intrigued by her casual singing, a customer suggested that she study voice formally.         She made her professional debut in 1940 as Fidalma in Cimarosa's ''Matrimonio Segreto.'' She sang her first Azucena the next night and repeated Fidalma the night after that, a feat that quickly established her reputation in Europe as a masterly interpreter of the Italian repertory at its most demanding.         She sang in Rome, made her debut at La Scala in 1943, sang in South America and went to London with La Scala in 1950. She made an immediate impression at Covent Garden, singing Mistress Quickly in ''Falstaff,'' and giving one of her stirring performances in the Requiem.         She remained a regular at La Scala and sang at the Metropolitan primarily in the 1950's and 60's. Of her many Verdi roles, she favored Eboli in her earlier years, but later leaned toward the lower registers of Azucena and Amneris. She finally found Mistress Quickly best attuned to her voice. Her repertory included 109 roles.         Miss Barbieri married Luigi Barlozzetti, a music director, who managed her career. He died about a decade ago. She is survived by sons Ugo and Franco, both of Florence.         Miss Barbieri paid a final visit to New York in the fall. On Nov. 2 she sang a brief a cappella solo at the Licia Albanese-Puccini Foundation gala at Alice Tully Hall. She also conducted master classes at the Juilliard School and the Manhattan School of Music, and sat for an interview at the Mayflower Hotel with Stefan Zucker, the director of the Bel Canto Society, a nonprofit marketer of vintage opera videos.       
         Nadine Conner, who sang on the radio with Bing Crosby and Gordon MacRae before a lengthy career as a lyric soprano at the Metropolitan Opera, died March 1 in Los Alamitos, Calif. She was 96.         She made her New York debut on Dec. 22, 1941, as Pamina in an English version of Mozart's ''Magic Flute,'' conducted by Bruno Walter. She was hailed for both her vocal promise and her youthful beauty. It was not generally known that she was then about 35.         After singing the role of the Forest Bird in ''Siegfried,'' she went on to demanding roles in 1943, singing the first of 25 Sophies in ''Der Rosenkavalier.''         She also sang with the New York Philharmonic beginning in 1942, when she took a solo part in Mahler's Second Symphony, under Walter, who then chose her for annual performances of the Bach ''St. Matthew Passion.''         Among her outstanding recordings was one of ''Hansel and Gretel'' in 1947, in which she and Risë Stevens sang the title roles. It was the first complete opera recording made in this country, according to the Met archivists.         In 1951, also under Walter, she sang Marzelline in ''Fidelio,'' in which her voice had to stand up to the heroic sounds of Kirsten Flagstad.         She progressed to a memorable Tyrone Guthrie production of ''Carmen'' in 1951 and 1952, and sang Mimi in a new production of ''La Bohème'' as well.         Altogether she gave 249 performances of 15 roles before her last Met performance, in ''Faust,'' on March 12, 1960.         The New York Times said her final performance made ''an appealing Marguerite'' that showed her vocally in admirable form. ''Her farewell performance,'' wrote John Briggs, ''was one of the best of her Metropolitan career.''         She was born Evelyn Nadine Henderson into a large, artistic family in Compton, Calif., and studied piano and drama as a child. In high school she studied voice on the side, and she soon decided that her voice belonged in the lighter lyric repertory rather than in roles like Puccini's ''Tosca'' or ''Madame Butterfly.''         She found a niche in radio, singing with orchestras in national broadcasts. She got the attention of talent scouts and, finally, the invitation to audition at the Metropolitan.         While studying music at the University of California in Los Angeles, she was briefly married to a classmate, whose name she kept for the stage.         She was married again, in 1939, to Laurance Heacock, a surgeon, with whom she returned to Southern California in 1970.         They settled in Cypress, where she taught singing.         Dr. Heacock died in 1987. She is survived by a daughter, Sue Lynn Hawkins of Irvine, Calif.; a son, Loren Heacock of Fountain Valley, Calif.; four grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.       
         Vera Zorina, a dancer and actress who starred in ballets, films and stage musicals choreographed by her first husband, George Balanchine, and whose mix of glamour and culture made her prominent in a variety of theatrical and musical fields, died on Wednesday at her home in Santa Fe, N.M. She was 86.         Ms. Zorina and the harpsichordist Paul Wolfe, whom she married after the death her second husband, Goddard Lieberson, the president of CBS Records, moved in 1990 to Santa Fe, where she continued a career as an opera director for several troupes, including the Santa Fe Opera.         Newer audiences saw her as a performer-narrator in dramatic oratorios. Public television captured her as the narrator in ''Persephone'' in the New York City Ballet's 1982 Stravinsky Festival, organized by Balanchine the year before he died.         Movie audiences, however, cherished other images of her. In the 1938 film ''The Goldwyn Follies,'' Balanchine made use of Ms. Zorina's outright sex appeal as well as her arabesques when he cast her as a nymph in a wet, clinging tunic, rising out of a pool. Other audience favorites include her role as a dancer opposite Bob Hope in ''Louisiana Purchase'' in 1941, adapted from a Broadway show choreographed by Balanchine.         Although Balanchine was considered the genius behind much of Ms. Zorina's success onstage and screen in the 1930's and 1940's (they were divorced in 1946), she was better known to the general public than he was in 1938, when they went to Hollywood to work for Sam Goldwyn.         Goldwyn was smitten with Ms. Zorina, who had been Léonide Massine's protégée in the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo. She had also starred in the 1937 London production of the musical ''On Your Toes.''         Whether Ms. Zorina insisted that Goldwyn hire Balanchine for ''The Goldwyn Follies,'' or whether Goldwyn brought them together, the collaboration ended in Ms. Zorina's marriage to Balanchine in December 1938. By all accounts, it was an unhappy union. Mostly, it embodied an experiment that integrated high art into popular culture. Ms. Zorina's films, in which she often played a dancer, did much to introduce audiences to ballet as an art form, one that was witty and contemporary.         Ms. Zorina was herself a product of an artistic milieu. She was born Eva Brigitta Hartwig on Jan. 2, 1917, in Berlin. Her mother, a Norwegian, and her father, a German, were both professional singers. Her parents separated when she was 6, at the time she began studying ballet with Evgenia Eduardova and Victor Gsovsky. At 14, she played a fairy in Max Reinhardt's celebrated production of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' and she performed in Reinhardt's 1931 ''Tales of Hoffman.''         After moving to London to study ballet, she had her first success in the West End in 1933: Anton Dolin, the British ballet star, cast her opposite himself in ''Ballerina,'' a play with ballet interludes.         Although friends called her Brigitta throughout her life, her professional name was changed to Vera Zorina by Colonel de Basil, as the director of the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo was known. He invited her to join the company in 1934.         As she wrote in her 1986 autobiography, ''Zorina,'' she became involved at 18 in an open ménage à trois that included Massine, then the world's best-known choreographer, and his wife, Eugenia Delarova.         Massine cast her in his ballets: she was the Street Dancer in ''Le Beau Danube'' and Action in ''Les Présages.'' But Ms. Zorina also cherished her performances in Bronislava Nijinska's experimental masterpiece to Stravinsky, ''Les Noces.''         After leaving the ballet company in 1936 and succeeding in the London production of ''On Your Toes,'' she divided her time between Broadway and Hollywood. While she was under contract to M.G.M. from 1938 to 1944, her films included a version of ''On Your Toes, as well as ''I Was an Adventuress'' and ''Star-Spangled Rhythm.'' Some, like ''Follow the Boys,'' did not involve Balanchine, but she collaborated with him in Broadway musicals, including ''I Married an Angel'' and ''Dream With Music,'' and for her role as Ariel in Shakespeare's ''Tempest.'' In 1943, she tried to return to a serious ballet career and was a guest artist with Ballet Theater, where Balanchine cast her as Terpsichore, the leading muse in his ''Apollo.''         In 1946, Ms. Zorina married Mr. Lieberson, who died in 1977. They had two sons, Jonathan, a philosophy teacher, who died in 1989, and the composer Peter Liberson, also of Santa Fe. In addition to Peter Liberson and Mr. Wolfe, whom she married 12 years ago, she is survived by three granddaughters.         Correction:  April 14, 2003, Monday  An obituary on Saturday about the dancer and actress Vera Zorina misspelled the surname of one of her sons. He is Peter Lieberson, not Liberson.       
         Caroline H. Newhouse, a philanthropist and artist who was the widow of Theodore Newhouse, a co-founder of the Newhouse communications company, died on Saturday at her weekend home in Roxbury, Conn. She was 94 and lived in Manhattan.         Her husband, whom she wed in 1956, and his brothers Samuel I. and Norman created one of the country's largest communications conglomerates, whose parent company is now called Advance Publications Inc. Theodore died in 1998. Mrs. Newhouse was an aunt of S.I. Newhouse Jr., chairman of Condé Nast Publications, owned by Advance Publications.         With her husband and on her own, she supported numerous cultural organizations in New York City with fund-raising and direct help. They included Career Transition for Dancers, an organization that she and her husband started, which helps dancers move on to new careers after they stop dancing.         She was one of the New York City Opera's original board members. After she retired from that post, she encouraged her nephew Mark Newhouse to join the board. He later became its president.         Born in a village near the city of Koblenz in western Germany, she originally had the surname Herz. She began studying the arts in Germany and became a sculptor and painter. She came to the United States in 1934 and attended the Art Students League in Manhattan.         She is survived by two grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.         Correction:  May 1, 2003, Thursday  An obituary on Tuesday about Caroline Newhouse, a philanthropist and widow of a founder of the Newhouse communications company, misstated her age. She was 93, not 94.       
         Janet Collins, prima ballerina of the Metropolitan Opera House in the early 1950's and one of a very few black women to become prominent in American classical ballet, died on Wednesday in Fort Worth. She was 86 and lived there.         Ms. Collins taught dance, choreographed, performed on Broadway and in film and appeared frequently on television. But she was best known as the exquisitely beautiful dancer who was the first black artist to perform at the Metropolitan, four years before Marian Anderson sang there.         ''She was a great inspiration to me as a child in Trinidad,'' the dancer and painter Geoffrey Holder said. ''What she did by dancing the way she did -- to be prima ballerina at the Metropolitan Opera House -- gave everybody hope.''         Ms. Collins made her New York debut in 1949, dancing in her own choreography on a shared program at the 92nd Street Y. John Martin, dance critic of The New York Times, described her as ''the most exciting young dancer who has flashed across the current scene in a long time,'' calling her style an eclectic mix of modern dance and ballet.         ''There is a wonderful sense of aliveness in the dancer's presence and in her moving,'' Martin wrote. ''She is not self-absorbed, but is dancing completely and wholesouledly for an audience. On the other hand, there is no air of showing off about it, no coyness or coquetry, but only an apparent desire to establish and maintain a communicative contact.'' He praised her for the sharp, clean precision, ''the piquant tang, the arresting mental vigor'' of her dancing and choreography.         Ms. Collins's next triumph came the following year on Broadway in the Cole Porter musical ''Out of This World.'' Playing the role of Night, she danced an airborne solo created for her by Hanya Holm. She went from there to the Metropolitan, where she appeared as a principal dancer.         She performed lead roles in ''Aida,'' ''Carmen,'' the Dance of the Hours in ''La Gioconda'' and the Bacchanale in ''Samson and Delilah.''         It was not until two decades after she left the Met, however, that she was to receive major attention again in New York when, in 1974, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater paid homage to her and Pearl Primus as pioneering black women in dance.         Born in New Orleans, Ms. Collins moved with her family to Los Angeles at age 4.         She received her first dance training at a Catholic community center and went on to study primarily with Carmelita Maracci, one of the few ballet teachers who accepted black students, and with Lester Horton and Adolph Bolm.         She auditioned in Los Angeles for the Ballet Russe but said she had been told that she would either have to have special roles created for her or dance in white face.         ''I said no,'' she told Anna Kisselgoff in a 1974 interview in The Times. ''I sat on the steps and I cried and cried.'' But the rejection spurred her, she said, to work even harder, hard enough to be an exception.         Ms. Collins danced with Katherine Dunham and performed with the Dunham company in the 1943 film musical ''Stormy Weather.''         She also danced a solo choreographed by Jack Cole in the 1946 film ''The Thrill of Brazil,'' and worked with the filmmaker Maya Deren.         She toured with Talley Beatty in a nightclub act that was sometimes billed as Rea and Rico De Gard to prevent speculation about the two light-skinned dancers' race.         Ms. Collins was most active during the 1950's, when she toured with her own dance group throughout the United States and Canada and taught at academies including the School of American Ballet, affiliated with the New York City Ballet; Harkness House; and the San Francisco Ballet School.         Ms. Collins is survived by a brother, Earnest, of Fort Worth, and a sister, Betty Wilkerson of Pasadena, Calif.         Correction:  June 7, 2003, Saturday  An obituary last Saturday about Janet Collins, a former prima ballerina of the Metropolitan Opera House, misstated the precedent for black artists there. Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday and several other performers at a jazz concert in 1944 were the first; Ms. Collins first appeared in 1951.       
         Jocelyn Herbert, a noted British stage designer, died on Tuesday in London. She was 86.         She is remembered in Britain for her austere, intelligently illuminated and evocative stage settings. They included the sets for the 1964 production of ''Othello,'' with Laurence Olivier, at the National Theater in London.         She also designed for opera, notably for the Metropolitan Opera's 1977 production of ''Lulu,'' for which her sets and costumes evoked a world touched by the Bauhaus, Art Moderne and German bourgeois styles.         She was educated chiefly in British schools, including the Slade School of Art, where she studied stage design.         In the mid-1950's she became a scene painter for the Royal Court Theater in London for a time. She designed for stage productions including Ionesco's ''Chairs'' (1958) and Arnold Wesker's ''Roots'' (1959), both at the Royal Court, and John Osborne's play ''Luther'' at the St. James Theater in Manhattan in 1963. Beginning in the late 1960's she designed opera for several institutional clients. She also did design work on various movies, including ''The Hotel New Hampshire'' and ''The Whales of August.''         She was born in London to Sir Alan P. Herbert, a member of Parliament, writer and humorist, and his wife, Gwendolen.         She is survived by a son and three daughters.       
         Susan Chilcott, a leading British soprano who had a winning Metropolitan Opera debut last year as Helena in Britten's ''Midsummer Night's Dream'' and received glowing reviews last June for her Royal Opera at Covent Garden debut as Lisa in Tchaikovsky's ''Queen of Spades,'' opposite Plácido Domingo, died on Thursday at her home in Timsbury, near Bath. She was 40.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         Ms. Chilcott, who began singing lessons at 6, attracted attention early in her career with her warm, dusky soprano and her stately and compelling stage presence. After appearing with the Scottish Opera, Opera North, the Welsh National Opera and the English National Opera, she made her first appearance outside Britain in 1994 at the Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie in Brussels, where she played Ellen Orford in a new production of Britten's ''Peter Grimes.''         There she became a protégée of the conductor Antonio Pappano, now the music director at Covent Garden, who said he was devastated by the news of her death. ''It is rare to come across an opera star who is as good an actress as she is a singer,'' Mr. Pappano said in The Times of London on Thursday.         Among the other roles she sang with the Brussels company were the Composer in Strauss's ''Ariadne auf Naxos,'' Hermione in the 1999 world premiere of Philippe Boesmans's ''Wintermärchen'' and Desdemona in Verdi's ''Otello,'' a part she also performed in a new production of that opera at the Glyndebourne Festival in July 2001. She made her United States debut in 1996 as Donna Elvira in Mozart's ''Don Giovanni'' at the Santa Fe Opera.         Ms. Chilcott's cancer was diagnosed in 2000. After surgery and chemotherapy, she had to withdraw the next year from a production of Prokofiev's ''War and Peace'' at the English National Opera. But as her condition improved, she continued to perform and accept important appearances, including the Met debut.         Last summer she made news during a performance in the ''Queen of Spades'' at Covent Garden when a candle set fire to the train of her dress. Absorbed in her singing, she did not hear the shouts from members of the audience and was startled when a member of the staff rushed onstage with a fire extinguisher.         Ms. Chilcott is survived by her husband, David Sigall, who was also her manager, and her 4-year-old son from an earlier relationship, Hugh.         She had been scheduled to sing Ellen Orford in the forthcoming season at Covent Garden and had also discussed future roles at the Met, though her illness prevented her from making any commitments.       
         Thalia Mara, a ballet educator who helped found the USA International Ballet Competition in Jackson, Miss., died on Wednesday at St. Dominic/Jackson Memorial Hospital. She was 92 and lived in Jackson.         Born in Chicago to Russian parents, Ms. Mara trained with some of the great ballet figures of the 20th century, among them Adolph Bolm, Olga Preobajenska, Nicholas Legat and Michel Fokine. She made her professional debut in 1926 with the Ravinia Park Opera Ballets in Chicago, leaving after a year to join the Carina Ari Ballet in Paris.         Ms. Mara directed the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in 1947 and also danced there with her husband, Arthur Mahoney, from whom she separated in 1964.         The two founded the National Academy of Ballet and Theater Arts in New York in 1962. The school closed in 1973.         Ms. Mara wrote 11 books on ballet, many of which were dance students' easy-to-read instructional works, including ''The Language of Ballet,'' ''So You Want to Be a Ballet Dancer'' and the ''Steps in Ballet'' series. Many were translated and published in other countries.         Ms. Mara moved to Jackson, Miss., in the mid-1970's, at an invitation of the Jackson Ballet Guild to create a professional ballet troupe. She worked with the company for six years, resigning in 1981. A judge at the International Ballet Competition in Varna, Bulgaria, Ms. Mara worked with Robert Joffrey, the artistic director of the Joffrey Ballet, and the dance writer Walter Terry to create a competition on that circuit in Jackson. She served as the artistic director for the triennial USA International Ballet Competition from 1986 to 1994.         Ms. Mara founded the nonprofit Thalia Mara Arts International Foundation, which sponsored teacher training scholarships, a piano competition and performances in Jackson by dance companies and musicians. In 1994 the city's Municipal Auditorium was renamed Thalia Mara Hall.       
         Christabel Burton Bielenberg, a well-born Englishwoman who wrote a best-selling memoir about saving her German husband, a Nazi resister, from the Gestapo, died on Sunday at the family's home in rural Ireland. She was 94.         Her book, ''The Past Is Myself,'' published in 1968, was a runaway success and a Book of the Month Club selection as ''Ride Out the Dark'' (Norton, 1971). It formed the basis for a four-part television drama, called ''Christabel,'' written by Dennis Potter and starring Elizabeth Hurley, which was shown in this country on ''Masterpiece Theater'' on public television in 1989.         Beautiful, headstrong and born to privilege in London, Mrs. Bielenberg spurned a scholarship at Oxford to study opera in Hamburg, Germany, where she fell in love with a dashing law student, Peter Bielenberg. They married in 1934, as Hitler came to power in Berlin. Ignoring advice to move to neutral Ireland, they stayed as he pursued his career as a lawyer and civil servant and their family grew.         Their social circle comprised people who initially rejected Hitler's Nazis as boors and were too late to grasp the true dimensions of the horror that befell Europe. For the Bielenbergs, the moment of truth came when a close friend, Adam von Trott, took part in plotting the attempted assassination of Hitler on July 20, 1944, for which he was hanged.         By January, Peter Bielenberg, suspected of complicity, was being held in a brig for recalcitrant S.S. men at Ravensbrück concentration camp. His wife pulled all the stops, using her well-connected British upbringing to plead for her husband at Gestapo headquarters in Berlin.         As a result, he was spared from being shipped to the eastern front. He was sent to a punishment battalion but escaped to a refuge in the Black Forest, where the Bielenbergs awaited the end of hostilities. After the war, Peter Bielenberg was the first German to receive a postwar visa to Britain.         Christabel Bielenberg reclaimed her British citizenship and, using her connections, returned to Germany briefly as a correspondent for The Observer. But the couple settled in Ireland in 1948, and she eventually became an Irish citizen.         The Bielenbergs bought a decrepit farm, which they nursed to profitability. They lived quietly without dwelling on their wartime experiences until asked to help with a book about Mr. Trott. That prompted Mrs. Bielenberg to start one of her own. It remains in print as ''When I Was a German, 1934-1945: An Englishwoman in Nazi Germany'' (University of Nebraska Press, 2000).         Peter Bielenberg died in 2001. Christabel Bielenberg is survived by their three sons, Nicholas, John and Christopher.         Hailing from a politically involved family, she acknowledged that it was odd for her even in Hitler's Germany not to have spoken out early on.         ''But it's true that we didn't protest soon enough about Hitler,'' she told an interviewer during the filming of ''Christabel.'' ''We just didn't know what had hit us. You read about horrors in the newspapers, but you don't really wake up to them until they touch you personally.''       
         Katharine Thomas O'Neil Bidwell, a patron of music and education who headed the Metropolitan Opera Guild in the 1980's, died last Thursday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 66 and also had a home on Fishers Island, N.Y.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Bidwell was born in Dayton, Ohio, and started a musical career when she joined the St. Louis Municipal Opera at 18. She graduated in 1959 from Sarah Lawrence College, where she became a trustee and sponsored programs in the performing arts.         She joined the board of the Metropolitan Opera Guild in 1966, became first vice president in the late 1970's and was president and chief executive from 1979 to 1986. After that, until 1996, she was the Lincoln Center's director of special projects.         For many years Mrs. Bidwell also headed the advisory council at the New York City Opera. She founded the Katherine Bidwell Foundation for Young Singers and the patrons' program of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, which she helped in commissioning new works.         She was also a trustee of the Greenwall Foundation, which supports emerging artists, Westminster Choir College and the London School of Music and Dramatic Arts.         el1 Mrs. Bidwell's first marriage, to Stephen E. O'Neil, ended in divorce. She is survived by her husband, J. Truman Bidwell Jr.; a daughter, Molly O'Neil Frank, of Manhattan; two sons, Stephen T. O'Neil, of Lookout Mountain, Tenn., and Charles Thomas O'Neil, of Stockbridge, Mass.; a brother, Charles Thomas, of San Diego; a sister, Frances Martin, of St. Louis; and eight grandchildren.       
         Audrey B. Love, a philanthropist and patron of the arts, died on Saturday at her home in Key Biscayne, Fla. She was 100.         Mrs. Love, who also had an apartment on Park Avenue in Manhattan, was the daughter of Edyth Guggenheim and Adm. Louis Josephthal, and was raised in Manhattan in a family devoted to the arts and philanthropy.         She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Smith College and soon afterward, on a trip to India in 1926, met her future husband, C. Ruxton Love Jr. Mr. Love, who died in 1971, was a Wall Street financier and diplomat, and the couple pursued a shared interest in collecting art.         In World War II, Mrs. Love served as president of the American Women's Voluntary Service. She was also a director of the New York Infirmary Hospital and a member of the Committee for Deaf and Dumb Children at Lenox Hill Hospital.         The Loves' collection of Napoleonic art was exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1978.         She was a founding member of the Lowe Art Museum of the University of Miami. Pieces from her collection of Georgian silver were exhibited at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in 2002.         Mrs. Love, who briefly pursued a career in the theater in her youth, was a lifelong patron of the opera. She contributed to the construction of the Metropolitan Opera in Manhattan. On an evening only days before her death, she was in her front row seat for a production of ''La Traviata'' by the Florida Grand Opera, which she had helped finance.         Mr. Love is survived by two daughters, the archaeologist Iris Love of New York City and Noel Gross of Saddle River, N.J., Wellington, Fla., and Bridgehampton, Long Island, and one grandson.       
         Katharine Sergava, the dancer and actress who portrayed the dream-ballet version of Laurey, the heroine, in the original production of ''Oklahoma!,'' died on Nov. 11 in Palm Springs, Calif., where she had settled in the mid-1960's.         Various sources give the year of her birth as 1909 or 1918, and she was also occasionally billed as Kathryn Sergava and Katya Sergeiva.         Although Hollywood studio officials once tried to promote Ms. Sergava as a second Greta Garbo, her greatest successes were on the New York stage where she performed Agnes de Mille's dances for Rodgers and Hammerstein's groundbreaking musical, from its premiere, in 1943, until 1947. From there she went into another musical, ''Look Ma, I'm Dancing,'' choreographed by Jerome Robbins. In 1956 she took over Lotte Lenya's role in ''The Threepenny Opera.''         Some sources give Ms. Sergava's birthplace as Tiflis (now Tblisi), in Georgia; others say it was St. Petersburg. She studied drama and ballet in Paris and London. After appearing in British movies of the early 1930's, she was brought to Hollywood in 1934 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where she was envisioned as a replacement for Garbo, who had announced her retirement. But Garbo did not retire, and Ms. Sergava went on to New York.         A glamorous personality, she favored wide sunglasses and earned a pilot's license. Performing in U.S.O. shows during the war, she acquired the nickname the Ballerina Pinup.         In New York, she danced with the Mordkin Ballet (1938-39), Ballet Theater (1940-41; today known as American Ballet Theater) and the Original Ballet Russe (1941), as Col. W. de Basil's Ballets Russes called itself then.         Ms. Sergava achieved acclaim as the ''dream'' Laurey, the dancing alter ego of the heroine of ''Oklahoma!,'' and performed the leading role in de Mille's long balletic fantasy. In an article about de Mille's ''Oklahoma!'' choreography in The New York Times, John Martin said that Ms. Sergava ''with her strangely remote quality of beauty becomes the ideal heroine of a rather terrifying dream.'' Later, she joined the Actor's Studio and acted in plays. She toured in 1953 in Shaw's ''Misalliance'' (in which she portrayed an airplane pilot), and appeared Off Broadway in 1955 in ''The Typewriter'' by Jean Cocteau.         Correction:  December 5, 2003, Friday  An obituary on this page yesterday erroneously reported the death of Katharine Sergava, a dancer and an actress who portrayed the dream-ballet  version of Laurey, the heroine, in the original production of ''Oklahoma!'' Friends of hers reported the error yesterday.         The obituary was based on one in The Daily Telegraph of London on Nov. 29. The Times was unable to confirm her death independently and, through reporting and editing errors, omitted attribution. The Telegraph says it has begun its own inquiry.         Ms. Sergava, who is 94 and has lived in Manhattan for many years, was hospitalized in November and is now in a nursing home.

         Vestal Goodman, a matriarch of gospel music whose influence ranged far beyond its traditional audience, died on Saturday in Celebration, Fla. She was 74.         The Associated Press reported her death based on information from funeral home officials and her own Web site. The cause was not given.         Mrs. Goodman and her husband, Howard Goodman, known as Happy, who died last year at 81, were cofounders of the Happy Goodman Family act. Friends said Mrs. Goodman never really recovered from her husband's death.         The Happy Goodman Family, whose enthusiastic and inspirational live performances recalled early camp-meeting evangelism, formed in 1949 and was on the road constantly for 50 years. They often appeared as part of Billy Graham Crusades.         The Happy Goodman Family recorded 15 No. 1 gospel hits and played more than 3,500 concerts. The family was inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 1998.         Mrs. Goodman, who dreamed of being an opera star as a girl, brought operatic flourishes to gospel. She never forsook her signature beehive hairstyle, her floor-length beaded gowns or the white handkerchief she carried in her right hand. Fans often waved their own handkerchiefs back.         The family's music revived in popularity in the 1990's, taking its place beside the younger contemporary Christian musicians and groups.         In the 1980's, the Goodmans were featured on the ''PTL Club'' television show of Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker. They left the program in 1988, and were not linked to scandals involving the Bakkers.         The Happy Goodman Family also often featured Happy's brothers Rusty and Sam.         They were an inspiration to the current gospel great Bill Gaither, who included the Goodmans in more than 60 of his Gaither Homecoming videos, a popular series that was a precursor of music videos. Mrs. Goodman was featured on the current Gaither Homecoming tour and had been booked to continue with the tour into 2004. Her autobiography, ''Vestal!,'' was published in 1998.         The troubled country star George Jones told The Tennessean newspaper in 2002 that after he was nearly killed a few years ago in a drunk-driving accident north of Nashville, he sent for Mrs. Goodman, who came to pray with him in the hospital and became a spiritual mentor.         Mrs. Goodman is survived by a son, Rick; a daughter, Vicki; four grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.
