         Mary Wesley, the popular British author whose sensual and often bitingly witty novels were not published until she reached her 70's, died on Monday in Totnes, Devon, her hometown in rural southwest England. She was 90.         Born Mary Aline Mynors Farmar, an Army officer's daughter, she was a lifelong writer who made her debut in 1968 with two books of fiction for children, ''Speaking Terms'' and ''The Sixth Seal.'' But her first novel for adults, ''Jumping the Queue,'' did not appear until 1983.         It was written in the years after the death of her second husband, Eric Siepmann, a journalist she married in 1952 and whose name she kept for the rest of her life. (Known as Mary Aline Siepmann, she adapted her pen name from her great-grandmother's name, Wellesley.)         Her husband's death had left her nearly penniless, with a teenage son to raise. ''Jumping the Queue'' tells of a middle-aged widow contemplating suicide and reflecting on her life as she encounters a fugitive wrestling with the same decision.         The novel offered original characterizations, playful allusions to sex and comic seriousness. It was critically acclaimed and despite its morbid theme, drew readers to her work.         Books by Mary Wesley then appeared almost annually through the 1980's and into the 90's. They often dealt with growing up middle-class in England, but American readers sought them, too, and many are still in print in the United States. Her last, ''Part of the Scenery,'' was published last year in Britain.         Ms. Wesley created ''an idiosyncratic fictional world, a middle-class English world,'' Michiko Kakutani wrote, reviewing the novel ''Second Fiddle'' in The New York Times in 1989. Her books' ''bright comic surface belies a dark subtext of sin, incest, murder and betrayal,'' Ms. Kakutani wrote, adding that ''cuckoldry and sexual gamesmanship thrive in her novels, and a chilly air of malice (or at the very least manipulation) that's reminiscent of Muriel Spark's work hovers over her characters.''         Born in 1912, Mary Farmar attended Queens College in London and the London School of Economics and Political Science before marrying Charles Swinfen Eady, a baron, in 1937. The marriage ended in 1944. She worked in the War Office during World War II, and her later writings reflected her wartime experiences.         She was the mother of three sons: William Siepmann, from her second marriage, and Roger and Toby Eady, from her first.         Unfazed by her late-blooming popularity, she once said that her chief claim to fame was ''arrested development -- getting my first novel published at the age of 70.''       
         Sarah McClendon, the tiny, klaxon-voiced White House reporter who covered, pestered, lectured and often infuriated presidents since Franklin D. Roosevelt, chiefly as the leader of her one-woman McClendon News Service, died today at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center here. She was 92.         First mocked in an almost all-male press corps, then scorned as a vocal crank and finally honored as a pioneer, Ms. McClendon was the nation's longest-serving White House reporter, from 1944 to the early days of the current Bush administration. She became celebrated for questions at presidential news conferences that included local concerns in Texas, her home state, and government lapses overlooked by others.         In the 1950's, she identified herself successively as the representative of so many of her small-town newspaper clients that Dwight D. Eisenhower once demanded to know, ''Do you get fired every week?''         Helen Thomas, the veteran White House correspondent recalled: ''She made the veins stand out in Eisenhower's head, because he would get so mad. Sometimes people thought her questions were off the wall, but other times, she hit them right in the eye.''         Indeed, Ms. McClendon once advised Eisenhower to ''leave off some of your golf and go out and visit some of the small cities.'' She later apologized.         ''Citizen journalist is a mission I took for myself,'' Ms. McClendon wrote in her 1996 memoir, ''Mr. President, Mr. President! My 50 Years of Covering the White House.'' ''It offers the best opportunity to serve one's country, the people and the public interest.''         In her later years, with just a handful of clients left, she sometimes embraced conspiracy theories without proof. But through the 1990's, she checked the White House's recorded announcement of the president's schedule before dawn. Her hair rinsed a reddish shade called Frisky Fawn, she used a wheelchair but still shouted questions in a style that Eric Sevareid once said could ''give rudeness a bad name.''         In 1962, she drew a withering rebuke from John F. Kennedy for publicly calling two State Department employees ''security risks.'' Early in his tenure, the first President Bush publicly warned her that ''the loudest voice won't always get recognized because it isn't fair to the others.'' But he took her questions just the same.         ''Many a president thought he could change the subject by calling on Sarah and lived to regret it,'' said Michael D. McCurry, press secretary for President Bill Clinton.         Mr. Clinton issued a statement today saying, ''I hope St. Peter is prepared for the kinds of questions that nearly a dozen presidents had to face.''         Ms. McClendon served as a public relations lieutenant in the Women's Army Corps in World War II, and she diligently covered the Veterans Administration, later the Department of Veterans Affairs. In 1974, she drew criticism for asking President Richard M. Nixon about delays in processing G.I. Bill tuition checks for Vietnam veterans. It turned out to be a real problem, and Nixon later acknowledged her in a radio address. Ms. McClendon disclosed that the Secret Service had warned her never again to aim a ballpoint pen at President Nixon when questioning him.         Ms. McClendon was born in Tyler, Tex., and began her career on small Texas newspapers before moving to the Washington bureau of The Philadelphia Daily News in 1944. Two years later she started her news service.         A brief marriage to John Thomas O'Brien produced her only child, Sally Newcomb MacDonald. Mr. O'Brien abandoned his wife while she was pregnant and later died. Besides her daughter, who lives in Washington, Ms. McClendon is survived by a granddaughter and great-granddaughter.         She was a single, working mother when that was rare, and on the day of her first Washington assignment she had to plead with a baby sitter to stay overtime. The sitter agreed, and Ms. McClendon made her deadline.       
         Dame Wendy Hiller, the distinguished English stage and screen actress who was George Bernard Shaw's choice to play two of his most famous heroines, Eliza Doolittle and Major Barbara, died on Wednesday at her home in Beaconsfield, England. She was 90.         Dame Wendy's performances were celebrated for spirit and integrity, and she became a major film personality despite only a handful of starring roles in movies.         In her 20's, she became an international film star by playing Eliza, the celebrated Cockney flower seller, exchanging barbs and grimaces with Henry Higgins (Leslie Howard) in the 1938 film of ''Pygmalion,'' and an heiress turned Salvation Army worker, matching wits with her professorial fiancé (Rex Harrison), in ''Major Barbara'' (1941).         Dame Wendy was also memorable for her broad cheekbones and impeccable enunciation, in a warm but somewhat quavering voice. She cemented her fame by playing a materialist turned romantic in a lyrical 1945 film, ''I Know Where I'm Going!,'' and a lonely but resilient hotelkeeper in ''Separate Tables'' (1958), which earned her an Academy Award as best supporting actress.         She played an obsessive mother in ''Sons and Lovers'' (1960), a steadfast wife in ''A Man for All Seasons'' (1966), a fussy Russian princess in ''Murder on the Orient Express'' (1974) and a compassionate nurse in ''The Elephant Man'' (1980).         Her other films included ''Outcast of the Islands'' (1952), ''Something of Value'' (1957), ''Toys in the Attic'' (1963), a television adaptation of ''David Copperfield'' (1969), ''Voyage of the Damned'' (1976), ''The Cat and the Canary'' (1979) and ''The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne (1987). Her last movie, in 1992, was the television film ''The Countess Alice,'' in which she played the title role, a former society beauty who is interviewed 50 years after her fame.         Dame Wendy said she had tried to make only films that were ''rather special and have stature,'' and to play only roles that were ''undull.'' She repeatedly rejected parts she did not believe in and passionately pursued those she liked.         She was also noted for carefully shaping and defining memorable characters. Basil Rathbone, who starred with her in the play ''The Heiress,'' an adaptation of Henry James's ''Washington Square,'' said he had never rehearsed with any performer who worked with such concentration, adding, ''She shuts everything else out in a most absolute way.''         Shaw chose her to star in his plays ''St. Joan'' and ''Pygmalion'' in a 1936 festival at Malvern, Worcester, before selecting her for the film adaptations of ''Pygmalion'' and ''Major Barbara.'' She described him as ''a most approachable and understanding person who talked to me a good deal.''         Dame Wendy recalled that at the age of 81, Shaw would stay up to all hours watching rehearsals of ''St. Joan.'' ''Once,'' she said, ''it was 3 in the morning when we finished rehearsing, and Shaw came up on the stage and said quietly, 'If you'd like to go through that again, I'd like to listen.' We were pale gray, and he was pink and fresh and blooming.''         ''He's a wonderful actor,'' she said. ''He used to act out all the parts, and he always put us to shame. He's also a cruel mimic. Once he gave me a demonstration of my walk; he said I walked like a schoolmistress. He made me feel the way I walked, and I never walked like that again.''         Wendy Hiller was born on Aug. 15, 1912, in Bramhall, a Cheshire town. Her father, Frank Watkin Hiller, a cotton-cloth manufacturer, and her mother, the former Marie Elizabeth Stone, also had three sons, René, Michael and John.         After completing secondary school, Wendy joined the Manchester Repertory Theater, where she was a bit player and later an assistant stage manager. Over the next five years, she won increasingly important roles and gained her first starring part, as the Lancashire heroine in ''Love on the Dole,'' an adaptation of Walter Greenwood's novel. Her acclaimed performance helped make the play a hit in London in 1935 and on Broadway in 1936.         A year later, she married Ronald Gow, one of the two writers who adapted the work for the stage. They had two children and lived quietly in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire. Mr. Gow died in 1993, and Dame Wendy's survivors include their daughter, Ann, and their son, Anthony.         She often limited her film and theater work to be with her family, but remarked to an interviewer that it was ''impossible to make a success'' of both home and career all the time.         ''Pygmalion,'' which was later the basis for the Lerner and Loewe musical ''My Fair Lady,'' gave Dame Wendy some of her finest scenes. As a reformed Cockney, she passes her tryout tea party by stressing her ''H's'' precisely while informing her guests that ''in Hampshire, Hereford and Hartford, hurricanes hardly ever happen,'' her famous elocution lesson.         In a later scene, she artfully blends pride and tension at a ball where she winningly impersonates a grand lady, conveying a stunning character transformation. The actress graciously credited this change entirely to Shaw, saying: ''He changes Eliza mentally. That is why the change is so profound.''         In World War II, Dame Wendy went on extensive factory tours throughout Britain, appearing as Viola in ''Twelfth Night.'' Later, on Broadway, her critical and popular triumphs included ''The Heiress'' (1947), ''A Moon for the Misbegotten'' (1957), ''Flowering Cherry'' (1959) and ''The Aspern Papers'' (1962), another James adaptation. In 1975, Queen Elizabeth II named her a Dame of the British Empire.         Dame Wendy's occasional television roles included an imperious but vulnerable principal of a women's college in a 1983 mystery, ''Miss Morison's Ghosts.'' Reviewing her performance in The New York Times, John J. O'Connor said she had ''reached that stage of her career where she can make the tiniest gesture speak volumes.''         He added, ''Her performance is the equivalent of a master class in acting.''       
         Doris Bass Andrews, who with her husband, Sperry Andrews, pursued the preservation of Weir Farm, where the Impressionist painter J. Alden Weir and friends met for painting and social activity, died on May 25 in Danbury, Conn. She was 82.         The farm, in Ridgefield and Wilton, Conn., is now the Weir Farm National Historic Site, with programs for both artists and the public. The programs are run by the Weir Farm Trust, a private nonprofit organization that works in partnership with the National Park Service.         Doris Bass was born in Louisville, Ky., and graduated from the Erskine School in Boston. She was an Army telegraph operator during World War II and attended the Art Students League in Manhattan. In 1947, she married Mr. Andrews, a fellow student, and they became working artists who painted in watercolors.         In the late 1950's they bought the buildings that Weir owned in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. By 1982, amid plans to build housing on former Weir farmland owned by others, the Andrewses were among those campaigning to preserve the site. Sixty acres of the original farm won historic status in 1990.         The trust's programs for professional artists include a competitive artist-in-residence program and a regional visiting artist program.         Surviving are her husband; a daughter, Catherine Barrett Andrews of Madison, Ga.; two sons, Charles Sperry Andrews IV of Sedona, Ariz., and Albert Ballard Andrews of Wilton; and a brother, Bruce Bass of Louisville.       
         Jinx Falkenburg, one of America's highest paid cover-girl models during World War II, and later, with her husband, Tex McCrary, a pioneer talk-show star on both radio and television, died on Wednesday in Manhasset, N.Y. She was 84 and lived in the nearby village of Mill Neck.         She died at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, a Long Island hospital of which she and her husband were among the founders, said her son Kevin McCrary. She and Mr. McCrary had lived apart for many years but remained friends. He died on July 29.         At one point in the 1950's, ''Tex and Jinx,'' as they were known in virtually every American household, had two radio programs, a five-day-a-week television show and a syndicated column in The New York Herald Tribune. They were among the first to refine the format that came to be called the talk show.         In addition to having a successful broadcasting career, Miss Falkenburg was long active in raising money for the Republican Party and helped her husband when he worked to persuade Dwight D. Eisenhower to run for the presidency in 1952.         She was born Eugenia Lincoln Falkenburg on Jan. 21, 1919, in Barcelona, Spain, one of three children of Eugene Falkenburg, an engineer, and Marguerite Crooks Falkenburg, an accomplished amateur tennis player. Mr. Falkenburg had a series of assignments in Spain, where he worked on electrifying railroads. The nickname Jinx was given by her mother. The name stuck.         Soon after Miss Falkenburg was born, the family moved to Chile and then, in her teens, to Los Angeles, where she went to public schools. She left Hollywood High School in 1935 to pursue acting and modeling.         She had already attracted the attention of a talent scout from Warner Brothers who had seen her play tennis. She was signed to a studio contract and, since she was fluent in Spanish, was given Spanish-language movies distributed only in Latin America.         Two years later, she met Paul Hesse, a professional photographer whose work appeared regularly in The American Magazine. He called her ''the most charming, most vital personality I have ever had the pleasure to photograph.'' In August of 1937, her face appeared on the cover, and that quickly led to invitations from more than five dozen other magazines to showcase her hazel eyes and lithe body.         At about this time she was sent to Honolulu to work on a film. In her hotel, she stepped on what she thought was a secure balcony, fell through the floor and landed in the dining room below. In a hospital for her injuries, she was assigned a room near one occupied by Al Jolson, who was convalescing. They were introduced and it led to Jolson's offering her a part as a cowgirl in his musical ''Hold On to Your Hat,'' which opened at the Shubert Theater in New York in 1940.         She met Mr. McCrary, who was then a writer for The Daily Mirror, when he was sent to interview her.         She was regarded as one of the most beautiful women in America. The New York World-Telegram observed that Miss Falkenburg's photogenic face had probably appeared in more different places in this country than that of any other woman around.         In 1941, Liebmann Brewery, the maker of Rheingold beer, decided it might sell a lot more of the brand if each year it bestowed on some attractive young woman the title Miss Rheingold. Miss Falkenburg was the first. It was a plum for any model, since, for starters, it put her name and face in every store in New York that sold beer.         Now she was asked to appear in Hollywood productions made for distribution in the United States. Her acting ability, however, did not attract the attention of the critics, who generally gave her films poor reviews. Among those 1940's movies for Columbia Pictures were ''Sing for Your Supper,'' ''Sweetheart of the Fleet,'' ''Lucky Legs,'' ''Laugh Your Blues Away,'' ''She Has What It Takes,'' ''Two Señoritas From Chicago'' and ''Cover Girl.''         During the war, she spent considerable time entertaining Allied troops, and in 1945 received the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal for her work. When Mr. McCrary returned from the war after service as a photographer and public relations officer for the Army Air Corps, he courted Miss Falkenburg and they were married in June 1945.         In 1946, Miss Falkenburg and Mr. McCrary pooled their considerable powers of persuasion and talked radio station WEAF in New York into giving them their own show. It was broadcast on weekday mornings and quickly became popular with the public and the critics because it tackled issues that were then controversial, including venereal disease, the United Nations and the atom bomb. The program was called ''Hi Jinx,'' and Miss Falkenburg, who had no experience as an interviewer, was coached by Mr. McCrary, who also wrote most of the show himself.         They made their television debut the next year in ''At Home,'' which was broadcast by NBC and showed them interviewing their guests at home. They also had another television program, called ''The Swift Home Service Club,'' in which they offered household hints and conducted chatty interviews.         Meanwhile, a second radio program, ''Meet Tex and Jinx,'' achieved such a following that it became a summer replacement for the popular ''Duffy's Tavern'' in both 1947 and 1948.         Tex and Jinx continued their work in television and also began to write a daily column for The New York Herald Tribune, called ''New York Close-Up.'' That led to yet another television show of the same name, on NBC. Miss Falkenburg's biography, ''Jinx,'' was published in 1951.         By the middle 1950's, Tex McCrary and Jinx Falkenburg were conducting their talk show from Peacock Alley in the Waldorf-Astoria.         Miss Falkenburg and Mr. McCrary were friends of John Hay Whitney, who was chairman of the finance committee of the Republican Party. At Mr. Whitney's request, Miss Falkenburg became head of the women's division in 1954.         Miss Falkenburg and Mr. McCrary had two children, John Reagan McCrary 3d of Manhattan and Kevin Jock McCrary of Mill Neck. Both survive them.         After the husband-and-wife talk show eventually ran its course, Mr. McCrary had his own radio shows for a time. He and Miss Falkenburg separated in the 1980's. In later years, she lived quietly on Long Island, serving on the board of the hospital the couple had helped found and working on a planned second autobiography.         Correction:  August 29, 2003, Friday  Because of an editing error, an obituary yesterday about Jinx Falkenburg, a model and early talk-show star, reversed the places of residence of her sons. John Reagan McCrary 3d lives in Mill Neck, N.Y., and Kevin Jock McCrary lives in Manhattan.       
         Althea Gibson emerged in the tennis world of the 1950's as a most unlikely queen of the lawns of Wimbledon and Forest Hills.         In 1950 she became the first black to compete in the United States nationals. She won 56 tournaments, including five Grand Slam singles titles -- the United States nationals and Wimbledon twice, in 1957 and 1958, and the French championship in 1956.         What made that especially remarkable was her background as a rough-hewn product of Harlem, a chronic truant and an eighth-grade dropout.         She had grown up far removed from the two genteel worlds of tennis: the white country club set and the network of black doctors, lawyers and other professionals who pursued tennis on private courts of their own.         Gibson owed much of her success to that very network of black tennis enthusiasts and to a geographic coincidence.         Althea Gibson, born in a sharecropper's shack in Silver, S.C., on Aug. 25, 1927, was brought to New York by her parents when she was a few months old. By chance, the family moved into an apartment on a West 143rd Street block between Lenox and Seventh Avenues that was a designated play street.         When the volunteers from the Police Athletic League closed the block to traffic and set up their recreation equipment, the spot they chose to mark off as a paddle tennis court was right in front of the Gibsons' front stoop.         A natural athlete who excelled in virtually every sport she tried, Gibson took up paddle tennis at 9 and won a citywide championship when she was 12.         In 1941 Buddy Walker, a Harlem bandleader and part-time P.A.L. supervisor, bought her two rackets and introduced her to friends at the Cosmopolitan Tennis Club, a predominantly black club that played on courts on 149th Street just a few blocks away but a world removed from the neighborhood she had known. Gibson was coached there by Fred Johnson, the one-armed club pro, and taken up by the club's members, who taught her some more important lessons.         As she put it in her 1958 autobiography, ''I Always Wanted to Be Somebody,'' the club attracted ''the highest class'' of Harlem residents, people, she noted, who ''had rigid ideas about what was socially acceptable.''         Those ideas were alien to her own experience.         ''I'm ashamed to say,'' she wrote, ''that I was still living pretty wild.''         Gibson would come home late (sometimes the next day) and her father, a garage attendant, would beat her. But Gibson saw her father as merely a stern disciplinarian, not abusive.         Gibson made a lifelong friendship when she approached her idol, the boxing champion Sugar Ray Robinson, in a bowling alley. Sympathetic to her dream of a career in music, he bought her a saxophone.         Finally, to escape her father's wrath, she sought refuge in a Catholic home for girls and eventually received a welfare grant to get her own apartment while she worked at menial jobs.         But it was tennis that gripped her interest. In 1942 she won her first tournament, the New York State girls' championship, sponsored by the American Tennis Association, which had been organized in 1916 by black players as an alternative to the United States Lawn Tennis Association.         In 1946, when she lost in the final of her first A.T.A. women's championship, she caught the eye of two men who changed her life and altered the course of tennis, Hubert A. Eaton of Wilmington, N.C., and R. Walter Johnson of Lynchburg, Va.         These men, both physicians and leaders of a cadre of black enthusiasts determined to crack the racial barriers of mainstream tennis, saw Gibson's potential and became her sponsors.         They arranged for Gibson to live with Eaton and his wife during the school year, practicing on his court and attending high school, and to spend the summer traveling on the A.T.A. circuit with Johnson, who later performed a similar service for Arthur Ashe.         She was 19 when she started at Wilmington Industrial High School, but finished in three years, graduating 10th in her class, and enrolled as a scholarship student at Florida A&M, receiving a degree at 25.         She also flourished on the court, winning the first of her 10 straight A.T.A. national championships in 1947.         In 1949, a year after Dr. Benjamin Weir had become the first black to play in a United States Lawn Tennis Association title event -- the 1948 National Indoor Championships -- Gibson took her first steps beyond the world of the black tennis circuit, making it to the semifinals of the Eastern Indoor Championships and then to the semifinals of the national championships.         The next step proved harder. Even after she had won the 1950 Eastern Indoor Championship and a clamor had begun to let her play in the National Grass Court Championships at Forest Hills, the precursor of the United States Open, the powers of tennis seemed to close ranks to keep her out.         To qualify for an invitation to the 1950 nationals, she was required to first make a name for herself at one of the major preliminary grass-court events. But no invitations were forthcoming.         Alice Marble, a former champion, rallied support for Gibson. ''If tennis is a game for ladies and gentlemen,'' she wrote in a letter to American Lawn Tennis magazine, ''it's time we acted a little more like gentlepeople and less like sanctimonious hypocrites.''         Finally, Gibson received an invitation to the Eastern Grass Court Championships at the Orange Lawn Tennis Club in South Orange, N.J. She made it only as far as the second round, but that was enough to win a bid to Forest Hills.         On Aug. 28, 1950, three years after Jackie Robinson had broken the color barrier in major league baseball, Gibson became the first black player to compete in the national tennis championship. Taking her place on a remote court at the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, Queens, she dispatched Barbara Knapp of England, 6-2, 6-2.         The next day, she faced the Wimbledon champion, Louise Brough. After losing the first set, 6-1, Gibson took the second, 6-3, then fell behind by 3-0 in the third before beginning a surge that brought repeated roars from 2,000 hardy spectators who ignored the first peals of thunder and flashes of lightning of a gathering storm.         Gibson took a lead of 7-6 and was on the verge of victory over her visibly spent opponent. But the rains came, the match was suspended, and when it resumed the next day, Brough won three straight games to win the match.         The 5-foot-10 1/2 Gibson gained the attention of the tennis public. A powerful if inconsistent player, the lean and muscular young woman had a dominating serve, and her long, graceful reach often stunned opponents.         Over the next half-dozen years, Gibson became a fixture on the tennis circuit, playing Wimbledon for the first time in 1951 and earning a ranking as high as No. 7 in the United States.         But Gibson became so disenchanted with her failure to break through to the top that she considered abandoning tennis and entering the Army.         In the fall of 1955, the State Department selected her for a goodwill tennis tour of Asia and the Far East, and the experience inspired her game. In 1956 she won 16 of her first 18 tournaments, including the French championship at Roland Garros, her first title at a Grand Slam event.         But once again victory in the singles championships eluded her at Wimbledon and Forest Hills, although she had been favored to win both. Gibson did team with Angela Buxton to win the Wimbledon doubles in 1956. She won in doubles again in 1957, with Darlene Hard, and in 1958, with Maria Bueno.         After losing to Shirley Fry of the United States in the singles final of the Australian Open in 1957, she did not lose another match all year. Passing up the clay court distraction of the French championship to concentrate on tuning up on grass courts in England, she again entered Wimbledon as the favorite and defeated Hard in the final.         ''At last,'' she said, ''at last,'' as she accepted the trophy from Queen Elizabeth II.         She later wrote in her autobiography: ''Shaking hands with the Queen of England was a long way from being forced to sit in the colored section of the bus going into downtown Wilmington, N.C.''         Upon returning home, Gibson was given a ticker-tape parade up Broadway, a banquet at the Waldorf-Astoria and a celebration on West 143rd Street.         She told friends and supporters, ''This victory belongs to you,'' but she chaffed at efforts to make her a symbol of black achievement.         When a reporter asked if she was proud to be compared to Jackie Robinson as an outstanding representative of her race, Gibson replied: ''No. I don't consider myself to be a representative of my people. I am thinking of me and nobody else.''         Having won Wimbledon, Gibson rolled through the national championship at Forest Hills. In the final, she defeated Brough, who had eliminated her in her first national seven years before.         After being named the outstanding female athlete of the year in a poll of Associated Press sports editors, Gibson repeated her Wimbledon and Forest Hills singles victories in 1958, and was named the outstanding female athlete again. Then, under pressure from her family to make some money from her talent, she announced her retirement from amateur tennis.         At a time when the professional game was little more than a sideshow, she had little trouble winning the pro title and went on an exhibition tour with the Harlem Globetrotters, playing tennis at halftime.         In the early 1960's she became the first black player to compete on the women's golf tour, but she never won a tournament. Gibson, who was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame at Newport, R.I., later held various athletic posts in New Jersey state government. A resident of East Orange, she had served as its recreation director.         Gibson was married twice, to William Darben and Sidney Llewellyn. She had no children.         When another black woman, Zina Garrison, made it to the Wimbledon final in 1990 before losing to Martina Navratilova, Gibson was there to cheer her on, but she soon receded from the limelight once again with health and financial problems.         ''It was truly an inspiration for me to watch her overcome adversity,'' Billie Jean King, who was 13 when she first say Gibson play, told The Associated Press yesterday. ''Her road to success was a challenging one, but I never saw her back down.''         Robert McG. Thomas Jr., a reporter for The New York Times, died in 2000.         Correction:  October 2, 2003, Thursday  An obituary on Monday about Althea Gibson, the first black competitor in the United State tennis nationals and the winner of five Grand Slam titles, gave an incorrect surname for the first black player in a United States Lawn Tennis Association title event. He was Dr. Reginald Weir, not Benjamin.       
         Leni Riefenstahl, the German filmmaker whose daringly innovative documentaries about a Nazi rally in Nuremberg in 1934 and the Berlin Olympics of 1936 earned her both acclaim as a cinematic genius and contempt as a propagandist for Hitler, died on Monday night at her home in Pöcking, south of Munich. She was 101.         After the defeat of Germany in 1945, she was pronounced a Nazi sympathizer by the Allies and never again found work as a movie director. But her revolutionary film techniques deeply influenced later generations of documentary makers and television commercial makers, keeping alive the debate over whether her talent could be separated from her prewar political views.         For many students of her life and legacy, Ms. Riefenstahl was both propagandist and genius. A popular dancer and actress before becoming a movie director in 1932, she enthusiastically put her talent at the service of the Nazis. Yet, without her exceptional artistic vision, her two most famous documentaries, ''Triumph of the Will'' and the two-part ''Olympia,'' would neither have caused a sensation at the time nor be considered classics today.         Ms. Riefenstahl never denied her early conviction that Hitler could ''save'' Germany. She also said that her idealized image of him fell apart ''far too late,'' near the end of World War II. But amid widespread skepticism, she insisted that she was never a Nazi and that ''Triumph of the Will'' and ''Olympia'' were apolitical, inspired only by her desire to create works of art.         Still, while her documentaries continue to be studied in some film schools, Ms. Riefenstahl remained trapped in the shadow of her association with Hitler. Her repeated attempts to find financing for a new film always ended in failure, while public screenings of her movies and exhibitions of her photographs invariably prompted protests. As recently as last year she was briefly investigated in Germany on accusations of race-hatred crimes, but no charges were brought.         She nonetheless worked hard to shed her image as the Nazi regime's most persuasive propagandist. After the war she spent 20 years in relative isolation, living in her mother's apartment in Munich. Then, in the late 1960's, perhaps out of frustration, she reinvented herself as a photographer and, within a decade, she had made her name in a new visual art form.         A tiny woman of great physical courage and fierce determination, she next took up scuba diving, claiming to be only 51, when she was actually 20 years older, to obtain a diving license. Two collections of her underwater photographs, ''Coral Gardens'' and ''Wonders Under Water,'' were published in the United States, and she continued diving in the Maldives until she was in her late 90's. Last year, to coincide with her 100th birthday, she released her first movie in almost half a century, a 45-minute documentary of marine life called ''Impressions Under Water.''         But it was her photography that stirred most controversy. Inspired by George Rodger's famous image of a muscular Nuba wrestler carried on the shoulders of another fighter, she made several trips to southern Sudan to photograph the Nuba. She worked alone at first, then later with Horst Kettner, 42 years her junior, who became her companion and lived with her until her death. She has no other survivors. In March 2000, while making a return visit to the Nuba, the 97-year-old Ms. Riefenstahl was severely injured in a helicopter accident in Sudan. She was flown back to a hospital in Munich.         Her first Sudan book, ''Last of the Nuba,'' published in the United States in 1974, won her recognition as a photographer and to some extent rehabilitated her as an artist. But while even in Germany it became acceptable to praise Ms. Riefenstahl as the most important female movie director ever, both her role in celebrating the Third Reich and what the critic Susan Sontag described as the ''fascist aesthetics'' of her work also came under new scrutiny.         Writing in The New York Review of Books in 1975, Ms. Sontag said there was a common ''aesthetic'' running through what she called Ms. Riefenstahl's ''triptych of fascist visuals'' -- her early work as an actress in Arnold Fanck's ''mountain films,'' her two principal documentaries and her photographs of the Nuba. ''The fascist dramaturgy centers on the orgiastic transactions between mighty forces and their puppets,'' Ms. Sontag wrote. ''Its choreography alternates between ceaseless motion and a congealed, static, 'virile' posing.'' When Ms. Riefenstahl was over 90, she again found herself at the center of heated debate when she was the subject of a three-hour documentary, ''The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl'' (1993), by the German filmmaker Ray Müller. At about the same time, she also published her own 669-page autobiography, ''Leni Riefenstahl: A Memoir.''         In the book she was able to give her version of her life. Writing in The New York Times Book Review, John Simon said the memoir did not contain ''a single unspellbinding page.'' He raised the question about the veracity of her accounts of everything from her private meetings with Hitler to her life with the Nuba. But he concluded, ''The book must, in the main, be true; it is far too weird for fiction.''         In the documentary, while Mr. Müller allowed her to talk at fascinating length about her filmmaking techniques, he also questioned her memory, notably her claim to have had few dealings with Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's propaganda minister. At the end of the documentary, Mr. Müller also tried to provoke her into admitting guilt for her past.         ''What do you mean by that?'' she asked, clearly surprised. ''Where is my guilt? I can regret. I can regret that I made the party film, 'Triumph of the Will,' in 1934. But I cannot regret that I lived in that time. No anti-Semitic word has ever crossed my lips. I was never anti-Semitic. I did not join the party. So where then is my guilt? You tell me. I have thrown no atomic bombs. I have never betrayed anyone. What am I guilty of?''         It was evidently a well-rehearsed response. In an interview with The New York Times last year, she said: ''I didn't do any harm to anyone. What have I ever done? I never intended any harm to anyone.''         Certainly in her final years she never shied from the limelight. In 1997, when a Hamburg gallery held the first exhibition of her work in postwar Germany, Ms. Riefenstahl agreed to be interviewed by major German news weeklies even though she knew much of the questioning would be hostile. That same year, ignoring protests, she traveled to Los Angeles to receive a lifetime achievement award from Cinecon, a group that restores old movies. In 2001 she visited St. Petersburg, where her films were shown in a documentary festival.         Whether out of vanity or naïveté, Ms. Riefenstahl may well have believed that her artistic independence was never compromised, that she did not ''sell'' her talents to the Nazis who financed ''Triumph of the Will'' and ''Olympia.'' Yet, shaped by the profound romanticism of 19th-century German culture, her monumental vision of beauty fitted perfectly into the National Socialist ideology.         Born into a comfortable Berlin home on Aug. 22, 1902, Helene Berta Amalie Riefenstahl grew up loving nature and outdoor life. Her mother encouraged her artistic flair, and although her father, a businessman, was opposed to her working on the stage, she began dancing in an Isadora Duncan-like free style at age 16 and soon found work -- and considerable recognition -- in Berlin theaters.         In 1924 her life changed direction. Recovering from an injury at 22, Ms. Riefenstahl was profoundly affected by seeing Fanck's movie ''Mountain of Destiny'' and promptly sought out the director. Entranced by the striking young dancer, Fanck cast her in his next seven mountain films, among them ''The Holy Mountain,'' ''The White Hell of Piz Palu'' and ''SOS Iceberg.''         These films gave her the image of a romantic heroine in the Wagnerian cast, in harmony with nature and bent on fighting evil. Her often dangerous roles -- she climbed rock faces barefoot and was once almost swept away by an avalanche provoked by Fanck -- also showed her to be fearless. In 1932 she directed her first movie, ''The Blue Light,'' another mountain film, in which she appeared as a warm-hearted peasant girl. (The names of her Jewish co-writer, Bela Balazs, and the film's Jewish producer, Harry Sokal, were removed from the credits when ''The Blue Light'' was reissued in 1938.)         It was also around this time, one year before Hitler's rise to power, that she first heard the Nazi leader speak at a rally. ''I heard his voice: 'Fellow Germans,' '' she recalled in her autobiography. ''That very same instant I had an almost apocalyptic vision that I was never able to forget. It seemed as if the earth's surface were spreading out before me, like a hemisphere that suddenly splits apart in the middle, spewing out an enormous jet of water, so powerful that it touched the sky and shook the earth. I felt paralyzed.''         She subsequently wrote to Hitler, noting that ''I must confess that I was so impressed by you and by the enthusiasm of the spectators that I would like to meet you personally.'' Her popularity as an actress made the request seem reasonable; Hitler's appreciation of her role in ''The Blue Light'' made the encounter possible.         In the years that followed she met frequently with the Nazi leader. She always stridently denied that they were lovers, although recalling one meeting, she later wrote, ''That evening I felt that Hitler desired me as a woman.'' At their first meeting in 1932, though, she said she was most struck by his informality and she quoted him telling her, ''Once we come to power, you must make my films.''         In her autobiography she said she told him that she could not make films on commission. Yet, the following year, with Hitler now chancellor, she made ''Victory of the Faith,'' a documentary about a Nazi party rally at Nuremberg. She was not happy with the film, and the following year she tried again, this time with ample time, money and equipment. The result was ''Triumph of the Will.''         The film, which took almost two years to edit from 250 miles of raw footage, included such innovative techniques as moving cameras, including one on a tiny elevator attached to a flagpole behind the speaker's podium that provided sweeping panoramic views; the use of telephoto lenses to create a foreshortening effect (for example, when filming a parade of Nazi flags); frequent close-ups of wide-eyed party faithful; and heroic poses of Hitler shot from well below eye level. The film also used ''real sound'' but was accompanied by no commentary.         The film won Ms. Riefenstahl assorted German prizes, and although she again pledged to make no more party films, she then made an 18-minute documentary, ''Day of Freedom: Our Army,'' about the Wehrmacht in 1935. Soon afterward, she was commissioned by the German Olympic Committee to record the 1936 Berlin Olympics. To the end of her life, she insisted that ''Olympia'' was not an official film, but ample evidence exists to suggest that it was indirectly financed by Goebbels's propaganda ministry.         Still, she made extraordinary use of the 170-member team of cameramen and technicians that she assembled. To evoke the early Greek Olympics in the first part of the documentary, ''Festival of the Nations,'' she filmed near-naked athletes in assorted heroic poses. During the training period, she also filmed close-ups of oarsmen, marathon runners and swimmers that she edited into the final version. When the games began, she had to cover 136 events because, she recalled, ''we never knew when a world record would be broken.''         And once again, both her filming and editing techniques broke new ground. To capture the drama of the pole vault and long jump events, she had holes dug beside the sand pit where the athletes landed. In the high-diving event, which dominated the second part of the film, ''Festival of Beauty,'' she used four cameras, including one underwater, to capture the movement of divers from all angles. Then, in the editing room, she turned the divers into graceful birds.         ''Olympia'' was not blatantly propagandistic. Notably, it showed Jesse Owens's moments of victory, while Hitler was seen for only 15 seconds on the single occasion that he visited the Olympic stadium. Although the film was widely praised, its reception in 1938 was muted by Europe's gradual slide toward war. She was also met with hostility when she took the film to the United States in November 1938.         When Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, Ms. Riefenstahl went to the front as a war correspondent, but she claimed that she soon left in disgust at Wehrmacht brutalities. Yet the following year, when Germany occupied France, she sent a telegram to Hitler congratulating him on seizing Paris. ''Everyone thought the war was over,'' she later explained, and in that spirit I sent the cable to Hitler.''         During the war she continued to see Hitler sporadically but turned her attention back to filmmaking. Several projects fell through, but in 1944 she was able to complete filming of ''Tiefland,'' or ''Lowlands,'' an adaptation of the Eugene d'Albert operetta in which she also played the role of a Spanish Gypsy dancer. The film was shot in the Tyrol, and its extras included Gypsies interned in a nearby concentration camp.         After the war Ms. Riefenstahl insisted she had not known that the Gypsies were being detained prior to their deportation to Nazi death camps. But when in April 2002 she repeated the claim that none of the Gypsies had died, a German Gypsy Association, Rom, started legal action against her, arguing that at least half the extras were later killed. On her 100th birthday the Frankfurt prosecutor's office opened an investigation into charges that she had denied the Holocaust, but the case was dropped two months later for lack of evidence and because of her advanced age.         Ms. Riefenstahl said she saw Hitler for the last time in March 1944 when she visited him in Kitzbühel, Austria, to introduce her new husband, an army officer named Peter Jacob. She later wrote that Hitler had aged considerably and his hands trembled, but ''he still cast the same magical spell as before.''         Ms. Riefenstahl's only marriage lasted little longer than her numerous affairs during her time as an actress and filmmaker. At the end of the war, she was detained for almost four years for de-Nazification, first by the American authorities and then by French forces. She was found to be a ''Nazi sympathizer'' but she was not banned from working and was finally able to release ''Tiefland'' in 1954. But her movie career was over.       
         Lady Donaldson, the first woman to be lord mayor of London in the 800-year history of the office, died on Saturday at a hospice near her family home in Lymington, England. She was 82.         For one term in 1983, Lady Donaldson held the highest title of the City of London. In 1981 and 1982, she was also the first woman to be the City's sheriff, a position established 500 years before that of lord mayor.         The ancient City is not London, although it is surrounded by London. Established by a royal charter in the 12th century, it is now famous as England's financial center.         By tradition, when the queen makes a state visit there, the lord mayor, carrying a sword, meets her at the city limit. The monarch gently pushes aside the proffered sword to signify acceptance of the lord mayor's sovereignty.         After being sheriff and lord mayor, Lady Donaldson went on to lead organizations concerned with cancer and the ethics of in-vitro fertilization, to serve on Britain's press complaints commission and to be chairwoman of a committee overseeing the ombudsman appointed to supervise the banking industry.         No women have succeeded Lady Donaldson as lord mayor. Because she was married to a baron, she was called lady rather than her own title of dame, which goes with the lord mayor's job. She also insisted on being called lord mayor, rather than lady mayor, and fined anybody who feminized her title a pound.         ''The fact that I'm a woman is purely biological,'' she said in an interview with The Associated Press in 1983. ''If it encourages other women to take more positions of responsibility, then it'll have achieved something, but I'm not a feminist.''         Dorothy Mary Warwick was born in Wickham, Hampshire, on Aug. 29, 1921. Her father, Reginald George Gale Warwick, was an ironmonger. Her mother, Dorothy Alice Warwick, was a schoolteacher and the first woman to serve on her local governing council.         Miss Warwick left high school to spend a year teaching English in Paris. On her return, she began training in Oxford to become a nurse. In London during World War II, she treated soldiers returning from Dunkirk and victims of the blitz.         Toward the end of the war, she met John Donaldson, a lieutenant colonel in the army, through his mother, whom Miss Warwick cared for in the hospital. They were married in 1945.         Her husband, an eminent lawyer and judge, was appointed master of the rolls, one of the highest-ranking posts in Britain's judiciary.         ''We've always led two separate lives -- perhaps that's why our marriage works so well,'' Lady Donaldson said to The New York Times in 1983. ''We've always got something to talk about.''         In addition to her husband, Lady Donaldson is survived by a son, two daughters and six grandchildren.         Before becoming sheriff, Lady Donaldson was the first woman to be a City alderman. Another woman, Edwina Coven, was elected 17 months earlier, but was vetoed by her fellow aldermen. It was the Court of Aldermen that elected Lady Donaldson lord mayor after she had been nominated by the City's livery companies, a mixture of charitable trusts, gentlemen's clubs and guardians of craft standards and training.         Lady Donaldson shunned the lord mayor's traditional garb, as her obituary in The Daily Telegraph yesterday pointed up.         ''If I were 20 years younger and considerably slimmer I might have considered wearing knee breeches like the men,'' she said. ''I hope to do better than the men who wear a suit under the robes. I'll only need a bra and slip.''       
         Joan B. Kroc, a prominent philanthropist, a former owner of the San Diego Padres and the widow of Ray A. Kroc, the founder and chairman of the McDonald's Corporation, died on Sunday at her home in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif. She was 75. The cause was brain cancer, a spokesman said.         In 1998, Ms. Kroc gave $100 million to the Salvation Army to build and endow the Ray and Joan Kroc Community Center in San Diego and $25 million to the University of San Diego to establish its Institute for Peace and Justice. In the 1980's she gave $19 million to the University of Notre Dame to endow an institute for international peace studies.         Through foundations and in her own name, she also gave major gifts for AIDS research, hospice care, environmental causes, nuclear disarmament and programs to combat drug and alcohol abuse and hunger. In 1987, she became the first person to give the Democratic National Committee $1 million.         Joan Beverly Mansfield was born in St. Paul on Aug. 27, 1928. She and Mr. Kroc were married in 1969, a second marriage for both, and moved from Chicago to San Diego after he bought the Padres in 1974. After he died in 1984, she was active in managing the club until it was sold in 1990.         She is survived by a daughter, Linda Smith; a sister, Gloria Chadima of Minneapolis; four grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
         C. Z. Guest, one of the monarchs of New York society who was a perennial selection on the best-dressed list, a noted horsewoman and an authority on gardening, died yesterday at home in Old Westbury, N.Y. She was 83.         Mrs. Guest's interest in horticulture began when she was a child following the family gardener around her parents' estate on the North Shore of Boston. Her name then was Lucy Douglas Cochrane, but she soon became C. Z. when her brother, Alexander, could not pronounce ''sister.'' Embarking on a writing career relatively late in life, she was the author of books on gardening and a children's book, ''Tiny Green Thumbs.'' She also wrote a syndicated weekly column that appeared in 350 newspapers across the nation.         Mrs. Guest began her writing career while recovering from a horseback riding accident in 1976. While she was convalescing, frequent telephone calls from friends about their gardening problems prompted her first book, ''First Garden,'' which was illustrated by her ''very dear friend'' Cecil Beaton and which had an introduction by another ''dear, dear friend,'' Truman Capote.         In his introduction, Capote described Mrs. Guest working in her garden: ''There, with her baskets and spades and clippers, and wearing her funny boyish shoes, and with her sunborne sweat soaking her eyes, she is a part of the sky and the earth, possibly a not too significant part, but a part.''         Beaton and Capote were only two in a legion of celebrities and jet-setters who surrounded Mrs. Guest throughout her vivid life. When she was married in 1947 to Winston Frederick Churchill Guest, an international polo star, heir to the Phipps steel fortune and a second cousin of Winston Churchill, the ceremony was held at the home of Ernest Hemingway in Cuba, with Hemingway serving as best man.         Until Mr. Guest's death in 1982, the couple was prominent in international social circles, hunting in India with the Maharaja of Jaipur and frequently entertaining the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, who subsequently became godparents of their children, Cornelia and Alexander.         C. Z. Guest was considered one of America's classic beauties. The writer Jill Gerston once described her this way: ''With her pale skin, blue eyes, ash-blond hair and trim figure, she is cut from the same cool, silky cloth as Grace Kelly. It is a patrician beauty that is indigenous to socially registered enclaves like Palm Beach and Southampton, a sporty, outdoorsy look that eschews makeup, hairspray and anything trendy. She has an outspoken, coolly self-assured manner and a throaty, well-modulated voice with a trace of a British accent.''         In 1962, Time magazine did a lengthy article on American society and apotheosized Mrs. Guest on its cover as the model of horsy high society. She posed in front of her Long Island estate wearing a button-down shirt and tie and jodhpurs, a sleek hound at her side, the personification of old-guard chic. Truman Capote once described Mrs. Guest as the incarnation of understated elegance and said she was ''a cool vanilla lady.'' John Fairchild, then publisher of Women's Wear Daily, described her as ''Southampton, Long Island American, Ivy League blond.'' British Vogue said she had ''the face of a flower.''         Often adorned by Mainbocher, Givenchy and Adolfo, she was chosen by the New York Dress Institute as one of the best-dressed women in the world early in the 1950's and remained on the list for years until her elevation to the Fashion Hall of Fame.         Mrs. Guest was also the designer of a small fashion collection introduced in 1985 and at the time made up principally of cashmere sweaters. ''I will only sell what I like to wear,'' she said after her sweaters had been displayed flung casually around the shoulders of models at the semiannual show of the designer Adolfo. A limited sportswear line was licensed in 1986 and in 1990 she came out with a fragrant insect repellent spray and other garden products.         Lucy Douglas Cochrane was born in Boston on Feb. 19, 1920, the second of five children of Alexander Lynde Cochrane, an investment banker, and Vivian Cochrane, the former Vivian Wessell. Her father died when she was 6. She was educated by tutors and later graduated from the Fermata School in Aiken, S.C. She made her debut in 1937, and was voted the glamour girl of the Massachusetts North Shore in a contest held in 1939, which prompted a brief fling as a showgirl. She appeared in a 1943 revue on the roof of the Ritz-Carlton in Boston and in a revival of the Ziegfeld Follies on Broadway in 1944. She spent six months in Hollywood attending 20th Century Fox's studio school but never appeared in a film.         ''My ambition was to be a successful enough actress to get myself thrown out of the Social Register,'' she once said. ''I had no talent at all but I enjoyed every minute of my experience.'' It was also during this period that she took off for Mexico, where Diego Rivera painted her as a nude odalisque. When she became engaged to Mr. Guest, her portrait, which had reportedly been displayed in a Mexico City bar, was bought by her fiancé's family.         Mrs. Guest became interested in volunteer work as a debutante in Boston and was active in numerous charitable organizations over the years, including the Children's Research and Asthma Institute, the Police Athletic League and the March of Dimes.         For years she was chairwoman of the April in Paris Ball and was a favorite of society columnists, who often mentioned her lunching with such friends as Elsa Maxwell, Mrs. William Paley, Mrs. Earl Smith, Doris Duke and Estée Lauder. They also mentioned her riding in the hunt country of Virginia, taking in the polo matches at the Piping Rock Club on Long Island, working hard on her orchids in her greenhouses or walking the grounds of Templeton, her estate on Long Island, trailed by a string of hunting dogs.         During the 1930's and 40's she was one of society's leading hostesses. ''She was very comfortable with all kinds of people, which is not common for a woman who's born to the purple, so to speak,'' her friend Eppie Lederer (the advice columnist Ann Landers) once observed.         The Guests jointly owned racing stables, with Mr. Guest supervising those in Chantilly, France, and Mrs. Guest supervising others in Middleburg, Va.. She loved exercising her horses and did so most mornings. For years she competed in the leading horse shows.         In 1984, Mrs. Guest was named commissioner general of the American garden exhibit of the International Garden Festival in Liverpool, England. The project, jointly sponsored by the United States Information Agency and the United States Forest Service, was a memorial to members of the Army Air Force who were killed in World War II.         Mrs. Guest was amused when her daughter, Cornelia was hailed by Life magazine as ''the debutante of the year'' in 1982 and herself became the darling of columnists and photographers.         In addition to her son Alexander, of Hunterdon County, N.J., and her daughter, Cornelia, of Old Westbury, she is survived by two stepsons, Winston Guest of Palm Beach, and Frederick, of New York, and three grandchildren.         ''I've always felt that having a garden is like having a good and loyal friend,'' C.Z. Guest once said.

''I will only sell what I like to wear,'' she said, after her sweaters had been displayed flung casually around the shoulders of models at a show by the designer Adolfo. A limited sportswear line was licensed in 1986 and in 1990 she came out with a fragrant insect repellent spray and other garden products.         Lucy Douglas Cochrane was born in Boston on Feb. 19, 1920, the second of five children of Alexander Lynde Cochrane, an investment banker, and Vivian Cochrane, the former Vivian Wessell. Her father died when she was 6. She was educated by tutors and later graduated from the Fermata School in Aiken, S.C. She made her society debut in 1937, and was voted the glamour girl of the Massachusetts North Shore in a contest held in 1939, which prompted a brief career as a showgirl. She appeared in a 1943 revue on the roof of the Ritz-Carlton in Boston and in a revival of the Ziegfeld Follies on Broadway in 1944. She spent six months in Hollywood attending 20th Century Fox's studio school but never appeared in a film.         ''My ambition was to be a successful enough actress to get myself thrown out of the Social Register,'' she once said. ''I had no talent at all but I enjoyed every minute of my experience.'' It was also during this period that she took off for Mexico, where Diego Rivera painted her as a nude odalisque. When she became engaged to Mr. Guest, her portrait, which had reportedly been displayed in a Mexico City bar, was bought by her fiancé's family.         Mrs. Guest became interested in volunteer work as a debutante in Boston and was active in numerous charitable organizations over the years, including the Children's Research and Asthma Institute, the Police Athletic League and the March of Dimes.         For years she was chairwoman of the April in Paris Ball and was a favorite of society columnists, who often mentioned her lunching with such friends as Elsa Maxwell, Mrs. William Paley, Mrs. Earl Smith, Doris Duke and Estée Lauder. They also mentioned her riding in the hunt country of Virginia, taking in the polo matches at the Piping Rock Club on Long Island, working hard on her orchids in her greenhouses or walking the grounds of Templeton, her estate on Long Island, trailed by a string of hunting dogs.         Mrs. Guest was for decades one of society's leading hostesses. ''She was very comfortable with all kinds of people, which is not common for a woman who's born to the purple, so to speak,'' her friend Eppie Lederer (the advice columnist Ann Landers) once observed.         The Guests jointly owned racing stables, with Mr. Guest supervising those in Chantilly, France, and Mrs. Guest supervising others in Middleburg, Va. She loved exercising her horses and did so most mornings. For years she competed in the leading horse shows.         In 1984, Mrs. Guest was named to head the American garden exhibit of the International Garden Festival in Liverpool, England. The project, jointly sponsored by the United States Information Agency and the United States Forest Service, was a memorial to members of the Army Air Forces who were killed in World War II.         Mrs. Guest was amused when her daughter, Cornelia, was hailed by Life magazine as ''the debutante of the year'' in 1982 and became the darling of columnists and photographers, as Mrs. Guest herself had long been.         In addition to her son Alexander, of Hunterdon County, N.J., and her daughter, Cornelia, of Old Westbury, she is survived by two stepsons, Winston Guest, of Palm Beach, and Frederick, of New York, and three grandchildren.         ''I've always felt that having a garden is like having a good and loyal friend,'' C.Z. Guest once said.       
         Dr. Margaret Singer, a leading expert on brainwashing who testified in several high-profile cases contending that various groups inappropriately manipulated their members to control their behavior, died on Nov. 23 in Berkeley, Calif. She was 82.         The cause was respiratory failure, said her son, Sam.         In her long career, Dr. Singer investigated and testified about techniques used by North Koreans against American soldiers in wartime and the Symbionese Liberation Army's influence over the kidnapped heiress Patricia Hearst.         In the 1950's, Dr. Singer interviewed a number of American soldiers who had renounced the United States after returning from captivity in North Korea. The soldiers, she found, had been isolated and plied with propaganda, at times under the threat of physical harm.         Years later, she testified in defense of Ms. Hearst in a case that brought Dr. Singer national recognition and helped generate public curiosity about mind control.         Dr. Singer and her colleagues delved into a little known area of psychology at the trial, arguing that Ms. Hearst had helped rob a bank because she had been brainwashed to embrace the values of the Symbionese Liberation Army, which abducted her.         The group, the team argued, subjected Ms. Hearst to intensely stressful conditions, like isolating her from family and friends and locking her in a closet for six weeks, allowing its members to indoctrinate her and force a bizarre behavioral transformation.         Though Ms. Hearst was convicted, the trial bolstered Dr. Singer's reputation as an expert on mind control. In the following years, she repeatedly testified against the Unification Church, led by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon.         In one case, a libel suit against The Daily Mail of London, she argued that the church was a cult that brainwashed its members by showering them with intense affection, a process she called ''love-bombing.''         Dr. Singer said that she had interviewed hundreds of members of the church and testified that its techniques for mind control were more powerful than those used by the North Koreans on their war prisoners. The church lost its case.         ''This has put us back to the start of the road again,'' Michael Marshall, an official of the church, said at the time of the lawsuit. ''But we shall continue to fight for recognition and to show that we are a genuine religious movement.''         Dr. Singer went on to testify as an expert witness in dozens of cases against groups she described as destructive cults. Former members of the groups or the anguished families of members, like some of the people who lost relatives among the Branch Davidians in the Waco, Tex., in 1993, would often seek her advice.         Several members of the People's Temple, with Dr. Singer's help, left that group before 900 people committed mass suicide in Guyana in 1978.         Dr. Singer would often help win lawsuits against groups that former members claimed had lured them into dark, insular worlds that left them psychologically traumatized.         ''Her testimony would help people understand the clinical impact of a cult's manipulation and exploitation,'' said Dr. Richard Ofshe, a sociology professor at the University of California at Berkeley who worked with Dr. Singer for 20 years. ''There was a constant stream of people who would go into these organizations and end up in psychiatric emergency rooms.''         Dr. Singer's battles made her a target for harassment and death threats. At times, she found dead animals on her doorstep.         Margaret Thaler Singer was born in Denver and earned her bachelor's degree, master's degree and Ph.D. from the University of Denver. She became an adjunct professor at Berkeley in the 1950's.         Dr. Singer conducted several widely known studies on schizophrenia and was a renowned family therapist. She spent much of her career at Berkeley, but also taught at the University of Rochester and Albert Einstein College of Medicine, among others.         In addition to her son, Dr. Singer is survived by her husband, Dr. Jerome R. Singer; a daughter, Martha Singer, also of Berkeley; and five grandchildren.
