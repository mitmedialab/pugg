         Irene Diamond, who after a successful career scouting scripts and talent in Hollywood became a major benefactor of the arts and medical research in New York City, died Tuesday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 92.         At her death, she was president of the Irene Diamond Fund, which she established in 1994 to support, in particular, the performing arts and the fight against AIDS. The fund succeeded the Aaron Diamond Foundation, which she and her husband, a New York real estate developer, set up in the 1950's.         In the 1980's, the couple took an innovative step, deciding to pay out that foundation's considerable wealth over 10 years. They made the decision just before Aaron Diamond, developer of Roosevelt Island, died in 1984. (She liked to say that at the time they married, however, she made more money than her husband.)         Mrs. Diamond remained in control of the foundation after his death. Over the next decade, as planned, she oversaw the distribution of $220 million in about 700 donations, with more than $50 million earmarked for the fight against AIDS.         Among the foundation's top priorities was the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center for the City of New York, affiliated with Rockefeller University. There, in a laboratory building facing Bellevue Hospital Center, its director, Dr. David D. Ho, made crucial discoveries about the immune system's struggle with the AIDS virus.         Through her own fund, Mrs. Diamond invested heavily in New York institutions like Lincoln Center. Recent gifts include $1.2 million for Jazz at Lincoln Center's new home, now being built at the former Coliseum site, and large grants for the Dance Theater of Harlem, New York City Ballet and the New York Public Library.         She aided causes like gun control and AIDS programs in the public schools and gave $10 million to the Juilliard School for a program to attract gifted minority students and teachers.         President Bill Clinton recognized her philanthropy in 1999 with the National Medal of Arts, and in 2001 she received the Andrew Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy. She also sat on the boards of Young Concert Artists, the Film Society of Lincoln Center and Human Rights Watch.         Irene Levine was born to immigrant parents in Pittsburgh, where she attended public schools. Hoping to be an actor, she took the name Irene Lee and studied repertory theater in Manhattan.         She did some modeling and freelance reading for Warner Brothers in New York before getting a job in Hollywood as an assistant editor in the studio's story division. At a meeting with the producer Hal B. Wallis, she began a 25-year collaboration in which she made recommendations on the work of as many as 32 writers. Some of the scripts that crossed her desk became classics, like ''The Maltese Falcon'' and ''Dark Victory.''         In 1941, back in New York, she read an unproduced play, ''Everybody Comes to Rick's,'' by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison. It came with several rejection slips, but its theme of the tough but idealistic American and his bar in Morocco seemed to her a perfect fit for the world news of the day.         She persuaded Mr. Wallis to let her buy the play for $20,000 -- he gave it the name ''Casablanca'' -- and the movie, starring Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, came out in 1943. It was just in time for the Allied invasion of North Africa and the Casablanca Conference of Roosevelt and Churchill.         After her marriage to Mr. Diamond in 1942, she continued to work in show business, back in New York. After a brief stint working for the producer Sam Goldwyn, she again worked with Mr. Wallis at Paramount Pictures as a story editor and was head of the talent division until 1970.         She was involved with films like ''Sorry, Wrong Number,'' with Barbara Stanwyck, and ''Come Back, Little Sheba,'' with Shirley Booth. She met and furthered the careers of actors like Burt Lancaster, Kirk Douglas and Robert Redford.         Mrs. Diamond is survived by a daughter, Jean, and two grandsons.         Speaking about ''Casablanca'' and her charitable priorities, she liked to say that ''philanthropy is a lot like Hollywood: you find a good script; you support it.''         Her own Irene Diamond Fund will continue her work, said Jane Silver, its executive director.         Correction:  February 15, 2003, Saturday  An obituary on Jan. 23 about Irene Diamond, a philanthropist who had an earlier career scouting Hollywood film scripts, including one that became the classic ''Casablanca,'' misstated the year of that film's release. It was 1942, not 1943.       
         Natalya Dudinskaya, who wielded major influence over the Kirov Ballet in Leningrad as its leading ballerina in the 1940's and 50's and as a revered teacher and the wife of its onetime artistic director, Konstantin Sergeyev, died on Wednesday in St. Petersburg. She was 90.         With her exceptionally brilliant classical technique, Ms. Dudinskaya was one of the most virtuosic dancers in the first generation of Soviet ballerinas after the Russian Revolution.         Although she starred in the 19th-century classics, from the time she joined the Kirov in 1931, she also created roles in many modern landmark Soviet ballets. In 1939, Vakhtang Chabukiani choreographed ''Laurencia'' and cast her opposite himself as his fiery Spanish heroine. The ballet became her signature piece and in 1958, as the Kirov's prima ballerina, she chose the unknown Rudolf Nureyev to partner her in ''Laurencia.''         He was 20 and she was 46, and he always expressed gratitude to Ms. Dudinskaya for this performance, the springboard for his international career. When the Kirov was scheduled to make its debut in Paris, London and New York in 1961, the producers insisted that Sergeyev (who died in 1992) and Ms. Dudinskaya not dance and yield to younger dancers. Nureyev, cast in leading roles, became a sensation in Paris.         After his defection there, Sergeyev and Ms. Dudinskaya were implicitly held responsible by Soviet authorities. In 1962 the government newspaper Izvestia printed a letter from Irina Kolpakova, Alla Shelest and other Kirov ballerinas, accusing the couple of hindering the careers of younger dancers.         The pair weathered the storm. Sergeyev was removed as artistic director of the Kirov in 1970 but three years later became director of its school, the Vaganova Academy. Ms. Dudinskaya, a favorite pupil of the celebrated teacher Agrippina Vaganova, retired from dancing in 1962 and became internationally known as a teacher and authority on the 19th-century classics. She coached several such productions at the Boston Ballet, beginning with the acclaimed ''Swan Lake'' that she and Sergeyev staged in 1990.         From 1951 to 1970 she taught the most advanced class at the Kirov and was a coach there from 1963 to 1978. From 1964 on, she taught at the Vaganova Academy.         Born in Kharkov, Ukraine, on Aug. 21, 1912, she was quickly noticed in Leningrad for what the Soviet critic Yuri Slonimsky called ''her chiseled, dazzling technique.''         Unlike her contemporary Galina Ulanova, she was not a lyrical ballerina but a pure classical dancer who was compelling in her outbursts of speed and temperament. Slonimsky called her ''a representative of the new style of Soviet ballet,'' for which she created roles in new works.         Some were choreographed by Sergeyev, who became her husband and her dancing partner after she appeared in his ''Cinderella'' (1946), set to Prokofiev's commissioned score. She also performed in Sergeyev's ''Path of Thunder'' (1957), about an interracial romance during the apartheid era in South Africa.         Nonetheless, she was at her best in classics like ''Swan Lake,'' ''Sleeping Beauty,'' ''Don Quixote,'' ''La Bayadère'' and, especially, ''Raymonda.''       
         Felice Marks Lippert, in whose kitchen Weight Watchers was hatched 40 years ago, died on Saturday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y.         The cause was lung cancer, her family said. Mrs. Lippert was 73 and lived on the East Side of Manhattan and in West Palm Beach, Fla.         Mrs. Lippert played a role in turning a budding business into an international phenomenon with millions of subscribers to its weight-control regimen. She helped develop the company's programs and was a director and vice president of Weight Watchers International until the H. J. Heinz Company acquired it in 1978. Heinz sold the business to a European investment company in 1999.         At the time of her death, Mrs. Lippert was chairwoman of the Weight Watchers Foundation, which promotes nutritional education. She also held the South African Weight Watchers franchise, which the Lipperts acquired in the mid-1990's.         The idea that eventually became Weight Watchers began in 1963, when Mrs. Lippert was living in Baldwin Harbor, N.Y., with her husband, Albert, and their two sons.         The couple had married a decade earlier and had settled into a routine that included weekly gatherings with friends for various activities; for example, they would hire an instructor to learn a new dance. By then the Lipperts had also realized they had a problem; they had put on weight.         Mrs. Lippert had heard about a woman in Queens, Jean Nidetch, who was teaching a diet program, and she asked Mrs. Nidetch to one of the weekly gatherings. A week later, following the nutritional regimen left by Mrs. Nidetch, Mrs. Lippert had lost four pounds and Mr. Lippert had lost seven. Eventually, they lost 100 points between them.         Realizing the potential, the Lipperts and Jean and Marty Nidetch huddled around the Lipperts' kitchen table for weeks to develop a strategy. They came up with the name and the concept of having people come to hear Jean Nidetch rather than her visiting their homes.         The two couples rented a space in Little Neck. Twenty-two people showed up at the first meeting, paying $2 each. Sixty-six showed up in a second space a week later in Baldwin. Within a year, Mr. Lippert began to sell franchises.         Jean Nidetch wrote ''Weight Watchers Program Cookbook,'' which sold millions of copies. Weight Watchers took off comparably.         Felice Lippert was born in the Bronx and graduated from Hunter College. She taught second grade in the New York public schools. She was on the boards of North Shore Hospital, the American Ireland Fund and the Cancer Research and Treatment Fund. She also supported the UJA-Federation of New York; St. Francis Hospital in Port Washington, N.Y.; and Hunter College.         Albert Lippert died in 1998. Mrs. Lippert is survived by two sons, Keith L., of Manhattan and Randy S., of Hellerup, Denmark; two sisters; two brothers; and four grandchildren.       
         Amy Sue Rosen, a modern dance choreographer known for her collaborations with the painter Derek Bernstein, died on Feb. 19 at her home in Manhattan. She was 47.         The cause was cancer, according to Mr. Bernstein, her husband.         Ms. Rosen, who was born in Baltimore, trained with Bill Evans and at Arizona State University and the Laban/Bartenieff Institute of Movement Studies in New York.         She began to work with Mr. Bernstein in 1983, shortly after coming to New York. Early on, their collaborations were consistently nonliteral, but with a compelling simplicity. Most have implied narratives, with mysterious characters undergoing mysterious experiences that are often melancholy or darkly funny, but too plain-spoken to be surreal.         Her dances were often based on autobiographical events. Her creative philosophy was ''go there and see where you go,'' Mr. Bernstein said recently. ''She never tried to explain anything.''         In her 1991 ''Boulder,'' men and women in gray raced, crawled and lingered on a jetty of dark rocks and were confronted by a pregnant woman in a red gown. Two years ago, Ms. Rosen and Mr. Bernstein began to create pieces that addressed her illness, culminating in ''Break/Broke,'' which has its last performance today at the Dance Theater Workshop.         Her work has also been performed at the Danspace Project, the Kitchen and other dance theaters in Manhattan, and at the American Dance Festival in Durham, N.C., where she was named the Samuel H. Scripps/American Dance Festival Humphrey-Weidman-Limón fellow in 1994.         In addition to her husband, Ms. Rosen is survived by three children, Sylve, Gustin and Vera, all of Manhattan; her mother, Claire Gelb of Tucson; and two sisters, Lisa, of Eugene, Ore., and Judy, of Estes Park, Colo.       
         Muriel Topaz, the former director of the Dance Notation Bureau and the dance division of the Juilliard School, and an authority on the choreography of Antony Tudor, died on Monday at the Connecticut Hospice in Branford. She was 70 and lived in Milford, Conn.         The cause was liver disease, said her son, Daniel Druckman.         Though trained as a performer and choreographer, a passion for preserving dances through notation dominated much of Ms. Topaz's career.         In a polemical statement to the 1982 conference of the Dance Critics Association in New York, she asked, ''Is choreography an evanescent form existing only in the bodies and personalities of the initial performers, or does it, like all other performing art forms, have a substance, a compositional integrity that transcends the initial performance?''         ''For surely, if it does,'' she continued, ''there can be no question of our obligation to document and pass on that art form to future generations.''         She championed the notation system known as Labanotation (invented by Rudolf von Laban in the 1920's), yet she urged choreographers to record dances in any way that might be comprehensible to others. In an interview with The New York Times in 1985, she said, ''Most of the revivals we see are possible only because someone at some time wrote something down.''         Ms. Topaz's convictions led her to notate works by more than 25 choreographers, including such diverse figures as George Balanchine, Gower Champion, Isadora Duncan, Martha Graham, Doris Humphrey, José Limón, Jerome Robbins, Paul Taylor and Tudor.         She felt a special affinity for Tudor, the British-born choreographer who created major productions for American Ballet Theater. Last year, she published a study of his achievements, ''Undimmed Luster: The Life of Antony Tudor'' (Scarecrow Press), and at the time of her death she was reconstructing as much as possible of ''The Planets,'' a legendary Tudor ballet that has not been performed since the 1940's.         Ms. Topaz was born in Philadelphia. She studied ballet and modern dance there and at New York University and Juilliard. She retained close ties to Juilliard, serving as the rehearsal director of the Juilliard Dance Ensemble from 1966 to 1970 and directing its dance divison from 1985 to 1992, succeeding Martha Hill, the department's founder.         Long associated with the Dance Notation Bureau in New York, Ms. Topaz was director of its Labanotation studies from 1970 to 1978 and its excutive director from 1978 to 1985. She also organized international notation conferences in Tel Aviv (1984) and Hong Kong (1990).         Ms. Topaz received a John Simon Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship in 1998, served as a panelist for many cultural organizations, including the Massachusetts Cultural Council and the New York State State Council on the Arts, and was an auditor for the National Endowment for the Arts. She adjudicated dance festivals across America and frequently wrote for dance publications.         Ms. Topaz's husband, the composer Jacob Druckman, died in 1996. In addition to her son, of Orangeburg, N.Y., she is survived by a daughter, Karen S. Jeanneret-Druckman, of Rolle, Switzerland, and three grand-daughters.       
         The performer who used the stage name Pepper LaBeija as a glamorous queen of the Harlem drag balls immortalized in the 1991 documentary ''Paris Is Burning'' died on May 14 at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She, as she preferred to be called, was 53.         A woman who answered the telephone at her mother's home but who would not identify herself said the cause of death was a heart attack.         Miss LaBeija (pronounced la-BAY-zha) appeared proudly in luxuriant female garb that was often golden and shimmering, and referred to herself in feminine terms, her friend Marcel Christian LaBeija said.         Marcel's given name is Herman Williams, but the last name of LaBeija is used by all members of the House of LaBeija, the group of performers Pepper led.         When Pepper LaBeija was not onstage, she was William Jackson of the Bronx, who sometimes dressed as a man.         Pepper was the last of the four great queens of the modern Harlem balls; Angie Xtravaganza, Dorian Corey and Avis Pendavis all died in recent years. These four exuded a sort of wild expressionism that might make Las Vegas showgirls seem tame.         ''This is the end of the golden age,'' said Brian Lantelme, a photographer who has covered the balls.         The House of LaBeija was one of the first houses, founded in 1970. The female impersonator who first led it thought the name LaBeija seemed glamorous. Pepper took over in 1971 or 1972, Marcel said.         Pepper LaBeija was called ''mother''; the house's younger members were the ''children.''         ''A house is a family for those who don't have a family,'' Miss LaBeija said in the movie.         Marcel LaBeija and Mr. Lantelme said that Pepper was also survived by a son and daughter, but did not know these survivors' names.         Miss LaBeija had diabetes, which had led to the amputation of both feet, and had been bedridden for most of the last decade. She last performed at a ball in 2001, when 30 attendants delivered her on a litter to the crowd's jubilation.         ''Her specialty was the Egyptian effect,'' Marcel LaBeija said.         Pepper LaBeija was a legend to the members and patrons of the Harlem ball scene, a world of extravagant make-believe that crosses sexual boundaries and that was chronicled in ''Paris Is Burning,'' directed by Jennie Livingston. In an interview, Ms. Livingston spoke of Pepper's ''glamorous bravado'' that stood out in a flock of Marilyn Monroes.         The public also glimpsed the ball scene in a Madonna video that featured voguing, a highly stylized and posed dance form used in the balls. Voguing was also featured at the Love Balls, which were held at Roseland in 1989 and 1990 and drew top fashion industry figures.         Though men have long dressed as women for many reasons, the modern institution of the Harlem ball began around 1960, said Marcel LaBeija, who is writing a book on the subject. The idea was to give gay blacks and Hispanics a place to dress up and perform. An earlier circuit for drag performers had been geared to white people, and black performers had sometimes whitened their faces to fit in.         The new balls did more than add racial justice. They set up changing categories within which to compete; these sometimes included Town & Country types, military personnel, corporate executives, schoolgirls and schoolboys and fashion models.         Trophies were awarded to those who best achieved ''realness,'' or resemblance to an archetype. The paradox was more bitter than sweet: performers strove to become the very people who would reject them. The best won trophies; no one won more than Miss LaBeija, who took away around 250, mostly for extravagant takes on high fashion.         Like many such performers, she had surgically implanted breasts. But she did not want a sex-change operation, explaining that women don't have it so great.         The drag ball scene, as portrayed in ''Paris Is Burning,'' had its sad aspects as well. One man says that the biggest ''realness'' a man can attain is to be convincing enough to make it home on the subway without getting beaten up for being in costume.         For most of her life, Miss LaBeija's world was the balls. Marcel said that Pepper supported herself by producing them and by teaching modeling.         In an interview with The Village Voice in 2000, Miss LaBeija said her life had grown more ordinary, and called herself an ''old-way legend in recovery.'' Without mentioning her disabled status, she volunteered that she had even given up shoplifting designer clothes, called ''mopping'' by performers who rely on the practice.         ''You mop, you get locked,'' she explained.         Correction:  May 28, 2003, Wednesday  An obituary on Monday about Pepper LaBeija, a leading performer at drag balls in Harlem, misattributed comments in a Village Voice interview about giving up shoplifting of high-fashion garments. They were made by Gerald Dupree LaBeija, a member of the House of LaBeija troupe, not by Pepper LaBeija.       
         Janet Collins, prima ballerina of the Metropolitan Opera House in the early 1950's and one of a very few black women to become prominent in American classical ballet, died on Wednesday in Fort Worth. She was 86 and lived there.         Ms. Collins taught dance, choreographed, performed on Broadway and in film and appeared frequently on television. But she was best known as the exquisitely beautiful dancer who was the first black artist to perform at the Metropolitan, four years before Marian Anderson sang there.         ''She was a great inspiration to me as a child in Trinidad,'' the dancer and painter Geoffrey Holder said. ''What she did by dancing the way she did -- to be prima ballerina at the Metropolitan Opera House -- gave everybody hope.''         Ms. Collins made her New York debut in 1949, dancing in her own choreography on a shared program at the 92nd Street Y. John Martin, dance critic of The New York Times, described her as ''the most exciting young dancer who has flashed across the current scene in a long time,'' calling her style an eclectic mix of modern dance and ballet.         ''There is a wonderful sense of aliveness in the dancer's presence and in her moving,'' Martin wrote. ''She is not self-absorbed, but is dancing completely and wholesouledly for an audience. On the other hand, there is no air of showing off about it, no coyness or coquetry, but only an apparent desire to establish and maintain a communicative contact.'' He praised her for the sharp, clean precision, ''the piquant tang, the arresting mental vigor'' of her dancing and choreography.         Ms. Collins's next triumph came the following year on Broadway in the Cole Porter musical ''Out of This World.'' Playing the role of Night, she danced an airborne solo created for her by Hanya Holm. She went from there to the Metropolitan, where she appeared as a principal dancer.         She performed lead roles in ''Aida,'' ''Carmen,'' the Dance of the Hours in ''La Gioconda'' and the Bacchanale in ''Samson and Delilah.''         It was not until two decades after she left the Met, however, that she was to receive major attention again in New York when, in 1974, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater paid homage to her and Pearl Primus as pioneering black women in dance.         Born in New Orleans, Ms. Collins moved with her family to Los Angeles at age 4.         She received her first dance training at a Catholic community center and went on to study primarily with Carmelita Maracci, one of the few ballet teachers who accepted black students, and with Lester Horton and Adolph Bolm.         She auditioned in Los Angeles for the Ballet Russe but said she had been told that she would either have to have special roles created for her or dance in white face.         ''I said no,'' she told Anna Kisselgoff in a 1974 interview in The Times. ''I sat on the steps and I cried and cried.'' But the rejection spurred her, she said, to work even harder, hard enough to be an exception.         Ms. Collins danced with Katherine Dunham and performed with the Dunham company in the 1943 film musical ''Stormy Weather.''         She also danced a solo choreographed by Jack Cole in the 1946 film ''The Thrill of Brazil,'' and worked with the filmmaker Maya Deren.         She toured with Talley Beatty in a nightclub act that was sometimes billed as Rea and Rico De Gard to prevent speculation about the two light-skinned dancers' race.         Ms. Collins was most active during the 1950's, when she toured with her own dance group throughout the United States and Canada and taught at academies including the School of American Ballet, affiliated with the New York City Ballet; Harkness House; and the San Francisco Ballet School.         Ms. Collins is survived by a brother, Earnest, of Fort Worth, and a sister, Betty Wilkerson of Pasadena, Calif.         Correction:  June 7, 2003, Saturday  An obituary last Saturday about Janet Collins, a former prima ballerina of the Metropolitan Opera House, misstated the precedent for black artists there. Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday and several other performers at a jazz concert in 1944 were the first; Ms. Collins first appeared in 1951.       
         June Carter Cash, a singer, songwriter and actress and the wife and collaborator of Johnny Cash, died yesterday in Nashville. She was 73.         She had been critically ill since having surgery at Baptist Hospital on May 7 to replace a heart valve.         Of all her accomplishments, the best known is probably the hit song ''Ring of Fire,'' which is about falling in love with Johnny Cash, and which he performed. Ms. Cash wrote the song with Merle Kilgore in 1963, long before her marriage to Mr. Cash in 1968 but after she had become close to him, working with him on cross-country tours. Instead of the usual seraphic love language of teen-angels, it used images of suffering and hellfire and is probably the most complicated popular love song in country music.         Valerie June Carter Cash was born into the Carter Family, the most important of the early country music groups, and one that helped changed it from a string-based music to a vocal music. Her mother was Mother Maybelle Carter, who sang and played guitar on songs like ''Single Girl, Married Girl'' and ''I'm Thinking Tonight of My Blue Eyes,'' some of the most important recordings of early commercial country music in the late 1920's.         She first lived in Maces Spring, Va., the hometown of her father, Ezra Carter, a farmer. But when she was 10 the family moved to Texas to be near the high-watt radio station XERA in Del Rio, Tex., where they performed on regular radio shows.         By the late 1930's she was performing with the group on records, radio shows and stages. At its largest, the group included Ms. Cash, her sisters Helen and Anita, her cousin Janette, her mother, and her mother's cousins Sara and A. P. Carter. June Carter had her own feature numbers, like ''Engine 143,'' which she sang in a wobbly but vigorously open-throated girl's voice, accompanying herself on autoharp.         The original Carter Family group dissolved in 1943. Ms. Cash, her sisters and her mother began touring and recording as Mother Maybelle and the Carter Sisters. June was the most outgoing of the group, a comedian as well as singer, and the shows mixed traditional songs of the Carter Family (like ''Will the Circle Be Unbroken'') with pop, gospel and vaudeville comedy. June created a routine involving a deep-country character named Aunt Polly.         By 1946 the group had developed a substantial audience through regular appearances on the ''Old Dominion Barn Dance'' program broadcast over WNOX in Knoxville. She crossed over to the pop charts with a hit song, ''Baby It's Cold Outside,'' recorded in 1949 with the comedy duo Homer and Jethro.         By 1950 Mother Maybelle and the Carter Sisters were regulars at Nashville's Grand Ole Opry. It was there that Ms. Cash met Elvis Presley, as well as two of her future husbands, the singer Carl Smith, and then Mr. Cash.         In her brief union with Mr. Smith she had two daughters, Carlene and Rozanna. She is also survived by her son with Johnny Cash, John Carter Cash; her stepchildren Rosanne, Tara, Kathy and Cindy; and several grandchildren.         In 1955 and 1956, the director Elia Kazan saw her perform and encouraged her to try stage acting. Newly separated, Ms. Cash took the advice, studying with Lee Strasberg and with Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York and staying with the Kazan family; on weekends she flew home to Nashville with her young daughters to perform at the Opry.         In the mid-50's she was managed by Colonel Tom Parker and toured with Elvis Presley. It was Presley who first told her about Johnny Cash, intriguing her with his description of how he managed to command an audience onstage while staying perfectly still. She and Mr. Cash finally met in 1956 backstage at the Grand Ole Opry, and she has written of an instant mutual fascination.         In liner notes for Mr. Cash's ''Love, God, Murder,'' she described his eyes. ''Those black eyes that shone like agates,'' she wrote. ''I only glanced into them because I believed that I would be drawn into his soul and I would never have been able to walk away.'' In ''I Still Miss Someone,'' from 1958, he sang, ''I never got over those blue eyes/I see them everywhere.''         By 1961, June Carter was married to her second husband, Rip Nix, and Maybelle and the Carter Sisters (renamed the Carter Family after the death of the original family's patriarch, A. P. Carter, in 1960) became part of Johnny Cash's touring show. She stuck to an old-fashioned, wholesome image, while Mr. Cash was becoming famous for drug taking, onstage swearing and explosions of temper. It was the worst period of Mr. Cash's addiction to barbiturates and amphetamines.         Ms. Cash was one of his closest confidantes, and she began hiding and throwing away his pills. She finally helped him to find counseling, and Mr. Cash often credited her thereafter with saving his life.         In 1967 they made an album together, ''Carryin' On,'' including the duet ''Jackson,'' which was a No. 1 pop hit and won a Grammy. (They won another Grammy for their duet ''If I Were a Carpenter'' in 1970.) Soon after, they became engaged.         Once married to Mr. Cash, she became a fixture in his show, telling jokes and singing, often appearing in antique lace dresses amid the silk and sequins and tasseled suits that were the standard outfits for country stars well into the 1970's. In the 1970's she also acted, and took roles on ''Gunsmoke'' and ''Little House on the Prairie,'' among other programs. She wrote a memoir, ''Among My Klediments,'' in 1979, and a book of autobiographical vignettes, ''From the Heart,'' in 1987.         She acted little after her marriage to Mr. Cash, but appeared in Robert Duvall's film ''The Apostle'' in 1997, playing the mother of Mr. Duvall's character. In 1999 she released her second solo album, ''Press On,'' a rough, unostentatious, charming record, which won a Grammy. It included songs from the Carter Family repertory as well as a new arrangement of ''Ring of Fire'' and several of her own songs, like ''Tiffany Anastasia Lowe,'' a song admonishing her granddaughter of the dangers of Hollywood life.         She and Mr. Cash divided their time between a house at the base of the Clinch Mountains in Virginia and estates in Nashville and Jamaica. Mr. Cash was seriously ill recently with diabetes and pneumonia.         Correction:  May 17, 2003, Saturday  An obituary of the country music singer and songwriter June Carter Cash yesterday misidentified the father of one of her children, Rozanna Cash. He was Rip Nix, her second husband, not Carl Smith, her first. The obituary also referred incorrectly to the recording of the song ''Jackson'' in 1967 by Ms. Cash and her third husband, Johnny Cash. While it did win a Grammy, it was not a No. 1 hit; the version of the song that became a hit on the Billboard top 40 chart was recorded by Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazlewood, also in 1967.       
         Anne Belle, a documentary filmmaker who specialized in portraits of New York City Ballet dancers, died last Wednesday at her daughter's home in Los Angeles. She was 68 and lived in Manhattan and Remsenberg, N.Y.         The cause was a heart attack, said Catherine Tambini, a friend and colleague.         Ms. Belle's two earliest films, ''Baymen -- Our Waters Are Dying,'' about the clam diggers of eastern Long Island, and ''Henry,'' about an independent old man living on a barge on the Hudson River, were shown on PBS. She later produced a trilogy of dance films about Suzanne Farrell, Alexandra Danilova and six ballerinas who worked with George Balanchine. The 1996 film ''Suzanne Farrell: Elusive Muse,'' an Academy Award nominee that she directed with Deborah Dickson, was a revealing portrait of a reticent young ballerina, Balanchine's last great inspiration, whom the choreographer loved deeply but failed to win off stage.         Ms. Belle captured all of the gaiety and pragmatism of Danilova, prima ballerina of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo from 1938 to 1952, in her 1987 documentary ''Reflections of a Dancer: Alexandra Danilova.''         ''Dancing for Mr. B: Six Balanchine Ballerinas,'' a 1989 documentary that Ms. Belle directed with Ms. Dickson, had affectionate portrayals of the choreographer and the ballerinas Maria Tallchief, Mary Ellen Moylan, Melissa Hayden, Allegra Kent, Merrill Ashley and Darci Kistler.         At her death, Ms. Belle was working on a documentary on Stanley Williams, a teacher at the New York City Ballet-affiliated School of American Ballet, and had an option to film the book ''Passionate Nomad'' by Jane Fletcher Geniesse, a biography of the explorer Freya Stark.         Born in Chile, she grew up in Canada, Morocco and England and studied ballet in London before moving to New York City. She worked for a time in New York as a freelance writer and an editor at House & Garden magazine. She received a master of fine arts degree from the New York University Graduate Institute of Film and Television in 1968.         Ms. Belle also produced, directed and edited several short films for the Children's Television Workshop. Her films have been shown at the Sundance and New York Dance Films Festival and at festivals in Berlin, Montreal, Chicago, Leningrad, Melbourne and Sydney.         In addition to her daughter, Antonia, of Los Angeles, Ms. Belle is survived by her husband, John Belle, partner in the architectural firm of Beyer, Blinder, Belle; her brother Michael Stagg of Oakland, Calif.; her son, David, of New York City; her stepchildren, Sebastian, of Augusta, Me., Fenella of Charlottesville, Va., and Amelia, of Sonoma, Calif.; and six grandchildren.       
         Elisabeth Welch, an expatriate cabaret singer who mixed elegant phrasing and emotive power to craft extraordinary interpretations of the songs of America's Jazz Age and Britain's musical stage, died on Tuesday at a nursing home outside London. She was 99.         Like Josephine Baker and Mabel Mercer, Miss Welch was a black woman born at the beginning of the 20th century who made an exceptional singing career outside of the United States. In Paris and London she was the darling of cafe society and, of greater importance to her, of such composers as Cole Porter and Noël Coward.         Only when Miss Welch returned to perform in New York in 1980 after a half-century absence did Americans grasp the quality of her work and discover a living link with some of the great names of American musical theater. Her influence was enhanced by performing abilities that were substantially intact at an advanced age.         In 1980 she received excellent reviews for her role in ''Black Broadway.'' In 1986 she was nominated for a Tony for her role in ''Jerome Kern Goes to Hollywood'' and won an Obie for her one-woman show, ''Time to Start Living.'' In 1989 she charmed audiences at Weill Recital Hall.         Writing in The New York Post about her one-woman show, Clive Barnes called her an original.         ''With her sweetness, her gentility, arsenic-laced with a sense of roguish innuendo and pagan sensuality, she is like no one else,'' he wrote. ''She has class, and class, and class. A saloon singer who would make any saloon into a salon.''         In his review of the Kern show, Frank Rich of The New York Times urged readers to write their representatives in Congress demanding that she be detained in the United States ''as a national resource too rare and precious for export.''         Or perhaps too precious not to export. She sang in a Paris cabaret frequented by Gertrude Stein and in the surreal nightclubs of pre-Hitler Berlin. She introduced ''Stormy Weather'' to British audiences, stopping shows at the London Palladium, where 50 years later she would receive five standing ovations.         Elisabeth Welch was born in Manhattan on Feb. 27, 1904, though some accounts say 1908 and her age varied in interviews over the years. In an interview with The Times on Feb. 1, 1986, she was said to be almost 77, which would mean she was born in 1909.         She was named after her mother, who was Scottish and spelled her name in the Scottish fashion. Her father, who descended from Africans and American Indians, was a coachman and later a gardener on an estate in Englewood, N.J.         She grew up in the area where Lincoln Center is now, which was then predominantly Irish. Her poor family went to Irish wakes hoping for sandwiches. She was the middle of three children, the others being brothers.         Her father, a strict Baptist, frowned upon girls who whistled, telling her, according to a 1987 interview in The Times of London, that ''whistling girls and crowing hens never come to good ends.''         Even before graduating from high school, she sang in the choruses of shows. Her father drew the line when he learned that she was appearing in a Broadway show called ''Runnin' Wild'' in 1923. She sang ''Singing Charleston'' to accompany the new dance, and in later years was often credited with having introduced the dance to the United States.         A brief marriage, when she was 18, ended in divorce, and she left no immediate survivors.         Using her nickname, Mr. Welch told his wife, ''Girlie's on the boards, she's doomed.'' In anger, he left the family forever.         After high school she did social work for a settlement house while also appearing in popular all-black revues. She considered her real debut to be ''Blackbirds of 1928,'' starring Bill (Bojangles) Robinson.         She was popular and accompanied the show to Paris, where it played the Moulin Rouge in 1929. She received her first favorable mentions in the press and appeared as a singer in chic nightclubs. Jean Patou, the designer, began giving her two dresses a year, in spring and fall.         In the summer of 1930 she was asked to come to New York to open a new room, the Salon Royal. An advertisement in The Times, titled ''Society's Latest Fad,'' called her ''an overnight sensation.''         Miss Welch performed Porter's song ''Love for Sale'' at the club. She had fallen in love with the new song when shown its score, but had waited to sing it until Porter's revue, ''The New Yorkers,'' opened. She considered that plaintive serenade to streetwalkers a work of poetry.         ''I thought of it as a street cry,'' she told The Times in 1980. ''I always had a sympathy for prostitutes. I knew some in Paris. They make me cry.''         Kathryn Crawford, a white actress, sang the song in Porter's revue. Critics were aghast that the wholesome-seeming young lady, dressed like a schoolgirl, sang such salacious stuff.         Porter, in a fury, left for Paris three days after the opening. The show's producers had meanwhile heard Miss Welch's more worldly rendition and hired her to replace Miss Crawford. Miss Welch insisted on apparel that an upmarket prostitute might fancy.         ''I walked on in black satin and wore high patent-leather shoes with red heels,'' she said in an interview with The Associated Press in 1980. ''I had a red maribou and a hat with an egret in it. The woman was very grand.''         Porter was impressed when he met Miss Welch in Paris and asked her to appear in a show he was staging in London. She said yes.         The show was ''Nymph Errant,'' which starred Gertrude Lawrence. Porter wrote the song ''Solomon'' for Miss Welch, and the novelty tune became her signature.         While she waited for Porter's show to open in 1933, she sang in a London show called ''Dark Doings,'' in which she introduced the song ''Stormy Weather'' to Britain.         She realized she had set a pattern, repeatedly singing what turned out to be a show's hit song and often nothing else. She jokingly called herself ''one-song Welch'' and in 1935 again overwhelmed audiences with the song ''Shantytown,'' which Ivor Novello, the star of prewar London musicals, wrote for her in his ''Glamorous Night.''         During World War II she entertained British troops with John Gielgud. In 1947 she brought ''La Vie en Rose'' to London, having heard Édith Piaf sing it in Paris.         Ms. Welch's decision to remain in Europe and make London her home may have resulted from a combination of her success there, her mother's Scottish and Irish ancestry and a visceral sense of belonging. Although American by birth, The Independent of London reported, she was British in thought and interest.         ''I never had any feeling about being different from anybody else,'' The Independent quoted her as saying. ''It equipped me to be an international person all my life.''         Miss Welch said many times that she never had any particular plan for her life. She claimed to be as surprised as anybody when she turned up in New York as a new discovery in 1980.         ''Things that have happened in my life just happened,'' she told The Times. ''I never had any star that I strove toward.''       
         Nina Fonaroff, an early Martha Graham dancer and a choreographer and teacher, died on Aug. 14 at a hospital in London, where she lived. She was 89.         Born in New York, Ms. Fonaroff began her dance training at 11 with Michel Fokine and Vera Fokina, his wife, and studied the Isadora Duncan style, two experiences that she later told friends suggested to her what dance should not be. She later studied dance at the School of American Ballet and acting and dance at the Cornish School in Seattle, where she met Graham and her accompanist, the composer and dance theorist Louis Horst. He became a major influence in her life.         Ms. Fonaroff joined the Graham company in 1936 and the next year she taught Graham technique at Sarah Lawrence College. She created roles in Graham dances, including ''American Document,'' ''Every Soul Is a Circus,'' ''Letter to the World,'' ''Punch and the Judy,'' ''Deaths and Entrances'' and ''Appalachian Spring.'' She left the Graham company in 1946 to teach and choreograph on her own.         Ms. Fonaroff began attracting attention as a choreographer in 1942. She was one of six dancer-choreographers to present pieces on a program that had a tradition of presenting new work by new choreographers at the Young Men's Hebrew Association (now the 92nd Street Y), which became an important incubator of American modern dance.         Ms. Fonaroff also presented choreography that year in a program shared with fellow Graham dancers Jean Erdman and Merce Cunningham, his first formal presentation of his own work in New York. Ms. Fonaroff was also among those participating in a short-lived American modern-dance repertory company, at City Center in 1949.         Her first full program of her own work received a glowing review from John Martin, dance critic of The New York Times, in November 1946. She had grown up in a musical household, learning as a child to play the violin and piano, and also began painting early, studying costume and set design in Europe and painting with George Grosz in New York. Martin wrote of her instinct for design as well as movement, adding, ''Here is a distinguished talent, highly individual in character, with something to say, and certainly with the means to get it said with taste, imagination and authority.''         Ms. Fonaroff was also a respected teacher at her own studio and at colleges, including Bennington College and at Teachers College at Columbia University. She also taught movement for actors at the Neighborhood Playhouse. Richard Boone, one of her students, later danced with her troupe, Nina Fonaroff and Company, which she maintained from 1946 to 1953.         Ms. Fonaroff began a new professional life in 1972, when she was invited to teach choreography at the London School of Contemporary Dance, where she remained through 1990. A glamorous and vibrant teacher, her students included the choreographer Kim Brandstrup and the filmmaker Sally Potter. In the late 1980's and into the 1990's Ms. Fonaroff also taught at schools in Oslo and Copenhagen. At her death she was working on a book about choreography.         She has no immediate survivors.       
         IN the eye of the festive hurricane that is the annual Caribbean parade on Labor Day, that soca-blaring, steel-drum-banging, sequins-and-feathers annual cavalcade down Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn, sits a not-a-bit ruffled Yolanda Lezama-Clark, R.N.         No, she is not the medical officer, though as a nursing administrator at Elmhurst Hospital in Queens, surely she could step in and do that, too.         Mrs. Lezama-Clark is the efficient, soft-spoken center of it all, the president of the West Indian American Day Carnival Association, which for 36 years has organized what has become New York City's largest parade.         Think of it as organizing a party for a couple of million people, with 500 vendors selling everything from commemorative T-shirts to curried goat, and entertainment by two dozen bands and music groups riding flatbed trucks with speakers the size of refrigerators. Don't forget to plan for 65 fanciful floats. And the likes of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg -- he wants to be trailed by a band truck so he can march to music -- and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton (the honorary grand marshal) have R.S.V.P.'d yes.         ''People ask me, 'How do you do it? How do you just maintain calm?' '' Mrs. Lezama-Clark said the other afternoon, a soft Trinidadian lilt spicing her voice. ''It's my personality, you know. What can I tell you? I have always been very low key. Both of my parents were very hyper people. To me it was like, why do we all have to be that way? Somebody has to maintain the calm.''         She spoke while sitting at her thoroughly uncluttered desk in the association's two-room storefront office at 325 Rogers Avenue, a few blocks off Eastern Parkway between a bodega and an evangelical church. Around her a dozen people bustled in and out, some sorting papers and packages of information for the various events preceding the parade, checking vendor lists and forms, and tending to the never-ending file of people calling for last-minute applications and instructions.         A calypso tune played softly on a radio; highlights of past parades flickered from a television. As if still presiding over everything, a large print of Mrs. Lezama-Clark's father, Carlos Lezama, the founder of the parade, who stepped down from the association presidency two years ago, looked down from the wall.         Mrs. Lezama-Clark kept one eye on her visitor and the other on the whirl around her.         ''We have a theme for the parade -- wait,'' she interrupted herself. ''Is that Mary's voice? Mary?'' It was, and Mrs. Lezama-Clark dashed off for urgent business.         THE theme, by the way, is ''Share the belief and strengthen the vision.'' It represents the direction in which she wants to take the association, to become more active in voter registration and community health.         The parade isn't enough?         ''If you want it to be a year-round organization, you can't just focus on Labor Day weekend,'' she said.         She does like to think big. Consider that she also wants to bring order to a parade whose freewheeling fun has gotten out of hand in the past. Four years ago, two 11-year-old children died when they were struck by vehicles along the parade route, and a teenager died afterward after being hit by a parade sound truck.         Mrs. Lezama-Clark has hired a private security force, a first for the parade, and has put in place route changes and other measures to help keep the procession moving and bring more sense to the order of march. The slow pace -- it runs from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. -- and herky-jerky movement has led to reduced television coverage, she said.         Mrs. Lezama-Clark is also pushing participants to keep it traditional, encouraging band members to lose the T-shirts and jeans in favor of the colorful costumes of Carnival.         ''Carnival is about music, it's about color and pageantry. It's not about T-shirts.''         Yes, Mrs. Lezama-Clark has a no-nonsense air, but she does not wish to rain on the parade, which happens a lot anyway. After all, she used to dance in it as a young girl, decked out in pink sequins, and has the snapshots to prove it. She favors calypso, which spills from her car radio on the drive home, often at 2 a.m., to Westbury, N.Y.         She spent her early years in Trinidad, coming to New York when she was 8. She won't reveal her age but does allow that she graduated from Brooklyn College in 1978, going into computer programming afterward and raising two daughters -- now 27 and 16 -- with her husband, Michael. Bored with programming, she eventually switched careers to nursing and is now studying for a master's degree.         The parade, though, has always been central in her life. She used to do the filing, run errands, answer the phone at 4 a.m. It was, and still is, she says, an almost spiritual fulfillment.         ''There is a magnetism around Carnival where you feel that if you are not there you really feel you are missing out on something,'' she said. ''You go through basic withdrawal. I do, come Trinidad Carnival, and I'm here in the cold and I know there is a lot going on down there.''         With all this running around, does she actually get to enjoy the parade?         ''Who, me?         ''No, I tend to enjoy it from the reviewing stand; you know, when the music pass and I see the people enjoying themselves,'' she said, looking a bit dejected. ''I tend to move as well but that's about the extent of it because I am tired by the end of the weekend.''         PUBLIC LIVES       
         Thalia Mara, a ballet educator who helped found the USA International Ballet Competition in Jackson, Miss., died on Wednesday at St. Dominic/Jackson Memorial Hospital. She was 92 and lived in Jackson.         Born in Chicago to Russian parents, Ms. Mara trained with some of the great ballet figures of the 20th century, among them Adolph Bolm, Olga Preobajenska, Nicholas Legat and Michel Fokine. She made her professional debut in 1926 with the Ravinia Park Opera Ballets in Chicago, leaving after a year to join the Carina Ari Ballet in Paris.         Ms. Mara directed the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in 1947 and also danced there with her husband, Arthur Mahoney, from whom she separated in 1964.         The two founded the National Academy of Ballet and Theater Arts in New York in 1962. The school closed in 1973.         Ms. Mara wrote 11 books on ballet, many of which were dance students' easy-to-read instructional works, including ''The Language of Ballet,'' ''So You Want to Be a Ballet Dancer'' and the ''Steps in Ballet'' series. Many were translated and published in other countries.         Ms. Mara moved to Jackson, Miss., in the mid-1970's, at an invitation of the Jackson Ballet Guild to create a professional ballet troupe. She worked with the company for six years, resigning in 1981. A judge at the International Ballet Competition in Varna, Bulgaria, Ms. Mara worked with Robert Joffrey, the artistic director of the Joffrey Ballet, and the dance writer Walter Terry to create a competition on that circuit in Jackson. She served as the artistic director for the triennial USA International Ballet Competition from 1986 to 1994.         Ms. Mara founded the nonprofit Thalia Mara Arts International Foundation, which sponsored teacher training scholarships, a piano competition and performances in Jackson by dance companies and musicians. In 1994 the city's Municipal Auditorium was renamed Thalia Mara Hall.       
         Clare Le Corbeiller, a longtime curator of the decorative arts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 71.         She had battled cancer for five years, said her husband, Jean Le Corbeiller.         Mrs. Corbeiller was widely knowledgeable in the decorative arts, specializing in Continental porcelain, metalwork and jewelry (with emphasis on 18th-century French) and Chinese export porcelain. She was also what might be called an old-school curator in that she was trained primarily through direct contact with objects, although she attended lectures in art history by Seymour Slive and Wolfgang Stechow during two years spent studying piano at Oberlin College.         Mrs. Le Corbeiller was born of American parents in 1931 in Cambridge, England, where her father was studying history. She grew up in Cleveland and in New York, where her mother worked at the Museum of Modern Art and as an editor at Lincoln Kirstein's magazine Dance Index.         Mrs. Le Corbeiller came to the Met as a summer volunteer in 1952 while studying advertising design at the Rhode Island School of Design. Except for a six-year absence in the early 1960's, when her two daughters were in the sandbox stage, she never left. She joined the museum's central cataloging department in 1953 and when that department was dissolved in 1959 -- an event that she saw as unfortunate -- she moved to the decorative arts department, known today as European Sculpture and Decorative Arts.         Mrs. Le Corbeiller's career both paralleled and contributed to the rise in prominence of the Met's European decorative arts holdings during the last 35 years. She was involved at all levels, micro to macro.         She systematized both the department's storage and its files, oversaw the installation of permanent galleries and period rooms, contributed to major exhibitions like ''The Arts Under Napoleon'' (1978) and guided acquisitions. With James Parker, she wrote the guide to the museum's Wrightsman Galleries (1979), the complex of spaces that display Jane Wrightsman's immense gift of French decorative arts; she also wrote the catalog for the gold boxes included in the gift (1977). She selected the porcelains for the museum's Jack and Belle Linsky Collection and also wrote its catalog (1984). With Alice Cooney Frelinghuysen she organized ''Chinese Export Porcelain'' at the Met in 2003 and wrote its catalog, published as the Winter 2003 issue of the museum's bulletin.         In addition, Mrs. Le Corbeiller published regularly in magazines like Apollo and taught in the Parsons/Cooper-Hewitt master's program and the Bard Graduate Center.         After her child-rearing hiatus, during which she wrote a book on American and European snuffboxes, Mrs. Le Corbeiller returned to the Met as an assistant curator in 1967, rising to full curator in 1991. She was named curator emerita upon her retirement in 2000. In her honor, the Met turned an issue of its annual Journal into a 319-page Festschrift; it contained essays by 28 colleagues from the museum and elsewhere, an in-house record in terms of contributors.         In addition to her husband, a teacher of mathematics and the history of science whom she married in 1958, Mrs. Le Corbeiller is survived two daughters, Suzanne Le Corbeiller of Pocatello, Idaho, and Geneviéve White of Pelham, N.Y., and four grandchildren.         Correction:  December 1, 2003, Monday  An obituary last Monday about Clare Le Corbeiller, a longtime curator of decorative arts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, misspelled the given name of a donor of French decorative works. She is Jayne Wrightsman, not Jane.       
         Cleo Athenos Stark, who performed with the modern-dance companies of Doris Humphrey and Charles Weidman in the 1920's and 30's, died on Nov. 9 in Manhattan, where she lived. She was 95.         Born in Greece, Ms. Stark came to the United States as a child. She trained at the Denishawn School, a pioneering dance academy founded by Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn. Early in her career she performed briefly with a group that accompanied Sally Rand, the burlesque fan dancer and stripper. In one number, in which Rand portrayed a bird, Ms. Stark danced as part of one wing.         She performed with Humphrey and Weidman from 1928 to 1934 and was in the original casts of many of their dances. Ms. Stark, who used her maiden name, Athenos, professionally, also staged dances in 1933 for a revue called ''Hunky-Dory,'' and danced in solo recitals after leaving Humphrey and Weidman. She was an artistic adviser to the Doris Humphrey Festival, produced by Mino Nicholas in 1990 at the Pace Downtown Theater in Manhattan.         Ms. Stark is survived by her son, Carl.         Correction:  December 2, 2003, Tuesday  An obituary on Friday about Cleo Stark, a modern dancer of the 1920's and 30's, misspelled her maiden name, under which she performed. It was Atheneos, not Athenos.       
         Lotte Berk, the dancer who gave her name to a no-nonsense system for achieving slim waists, trim thighs and taut bottoms that became a must for glamorous women in the 1960's, died on Nov. 4 in England. She was 90 and had lived there in Hungerford, Berkshire, since retiring about 20 years ago.         A German-born ballet dancer who settled in Britain, she devised a set of disciplined exercises called the Lotte Berk Method. Blending elements of yoga and dance with stretches and pelvic gyrations, she and her disciples have toned bodies, including many rich and famous ones, in studios on both sides of the Atlantic. Many studios using her method still operate.         Lotte Berk was a phenomenon of the 1960's scene of swinging London. Most of those fads ran their course. But the quest for a sleek contour, which she led for many years in her own exercise center, lived on.         Her message of rigorous exercise, at the barre and on the floor, spread without much advertising and largely by word of mouth. The message, preached in many exercise studios, was videotaped for those who want privacy and trust in their own self-discipline.         Lieselotte Heymansohn was born to a well-to-do father in Cologne -- her mother died when she was a child -- and studied modern dance with Mary Wigman in Cologne, against her father's wishes. At 20, she married a British dancer, Ernest Berk, with whom she had a daughter, Esther.         They performed in Germany between the wars but fled to England when the rise of Hitler made a serious career impossible for her as a Jew in Germany.         Ms. Berk performed with some modern dance companies, living as a free spirit in what was known as an open marriage, and in the 1950's began the work that established her reputation from London to New York and California.         There are differing versions of that beginning. According to one, she suffered a serious spinal injury in a car accident and by dint of willpower exercised her way out of a wheelchair. Another is that she realized what middle-age flab was doing to her petite dancer's body.         With the help of her legendary self-control and an osteopath, she devised a regimen of training to restore her musculature and body posture. For strength and suppleness, she concentrated on the abdominals, the pelvic region and the lower back, engaging them in isometric movements, lying on the carpet or facing a mirror at the barre.         Men were barred from her original basement studio off Oxford Street in central London. The names she gave her pelvic exercises and muscle tweaks had a decidedly earthy flavor with sexual connotations.         Her marriage to Ernest Berk lasted about 30 years, and she is survived by their daughter, Esther Fairfax, of Hungerford. According to The Guardian in London, Ms. Berk stated that she had been married seven times, ''twice on paper.''       
         Regina Ovesey, the first woman to be chief executive of an advertising agency recognized by the industry's main trade group, the American Association of Advertising Agencies, died on Dec. 13 in Manhattan, where she lived. She was 82.         The cause was lung cancer, said her daughter, Candace Ovesey.         Ms. Ovesey started her agency, Ovesey & Company, in the 1940's, when advertising was heavily dominated by men. Though the agency had accounts from burglar alarms to wallpaper, it specialized in the fashion industry, creating campaigns for clients like Barneys and Kate Greenaway, a maker of children's clothing. In the 1980's, Ms. Ovesey began to work almost exclusively with Capezio, a maker of dance apparel.         Regina Haimo was born in Philadelphia, grew up in Los Angeles, and graduated from Stanford University.         Her husband, Lionel Ovesey, died in 1995. Ms. Ovesey is survived by two daughters, Candace, of Danbury, Conn., and Michele, of Manhattan; and four grandchildren.       
         Isabelle Stevenson, the president of the American Theater Wing for more than 30 years, its chairwoman for the last five years and one of the best-known figures in the theater world, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan, her daughter Laura said. She was 90.         She was perhaps best known to the public as the doyenne of the Tony Awards, Broadway's equivalent of the Academy Awards and the American theater's most widely recognized prize. The Tony Awards were founded by the Theater Wing in 1947 and named for Antoinette Perry, a former chairwoman who ran the organization during World War II. They are jointly administered by the wing and the League of American Theaters and Producers, the trade association of Broadway theater owners and producers.         The Tony telecast, administered by a Tony Management Committee of five wing and five league representatives, means not only prestige but also money. It is shown each year just before summer vacation time, and the play that wins the Tony almost always enjoys extra tourist dollars. The Theater Wing's share of income from the award broadcast, along with fund-raising events, private contributions and membership fees, also supports its programs.         Mrs. Stevenson was responsible for several major innovations in her long tenure at the wing, which is primarily a service and education organization, building audiences for the stage as well as honoring excellence in the theater.         She inaugurated the series of ''Working in the Theater'' seminars, held twice a year at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and shown on cable television. The seminars bring together leading performers, playwrights, directors, producers and scenic and costume designers.         She also began a program of grants and fellowships to Off and Off Off Broadway theaters. Theater in Schools, begun under her auspices, sends professionals to high schools to talk about their craft and provides scholarships to high school graduates to further their theater training.         Mrs. Stevenson nurtured other Theater Wing programs, including the Hospital Program, which takes plays and cabaret shows to hospitals, nursing homes and AIDS centers and, for many years, a Theater for Children, which produced plays for thousands of New York public-school students each year. Another program, Introduction to Broadway, provides Broadway theater tickets for $2.50 to high school students in an attempt to develop the audience of the future.         For more than half a century, Tonys have been given only to Broadway plays and performers. For many of those years Mrs. Stevenson pressed for a change in rules that would permit Off Broadway plays to be eligible for Tony Awards. And for years she failed. ''When the Tonys started, there wasn't really any Off Broadway, so the rules said Broadway theaters,'' Mrs. Stevenson said frequently. ''That should be changed now. I think Off Broadway's contribution to the theater should not be ignored.'' At the time of her death, the rules still had not changed.         Mrs. Stevenson was born Isabelle Lubow in Vineland, N.J., on May 15, 1913, the daughter of Sonia Lubow and Samuel Lieberman, who were married but lived separate lives. She and her two sisters took their mother's name. The family moved from Philadelphia to Far Rockaway when she was 10 and, several years later, to Brooklyn.         At 14, to take off weight, she began dance classes in Manhattan and met Harry Foster, a producer from England who was interested in organizing a line of dancers. Young Isabelle was one of the 15 chosen for training. The group was later known as the Foster Girls and was a part of ''Earl Carroll's Vanities.'' She was picked up each night by her mother and taken home on the subway.         When the show was taken on the road, Mrs. Lubow refused to allow her daughter to travel with it. So Isabelle began doing solo dance acts in vaudeville and a short time later, formed an act with two young male dancers. The trio, billed as Nice, Florio and Lubow, played the RKO circuit, including the Palace in New York. They also played Britain and took part in a command performance for Queen Mary and King George V. Mrs. Lubow accompanied her daughter everywhere.         Mrs. Stevenson met her future husband during a booking in Australia. John Stevenson had come out from England and was working on a newspaper in Melbourne. He returned to New York as promotion manager of The New York Post, and they were married in 1937. Mr. Stevenson, later involved in marketing of books and records, died in February 2002.         ''There was no question of my working -- I wasn't Katherine Cornell or Helen Hayes,'' Mrs. Stevenson recalled in a 1997 interview, when asked why she gave up her dancing career. ''I went to the Traphagen School of Design, took dance classes and courses in journalism and then I went to work for my husband as women's editor.'' By then, there were two daughters, as well as her sister's child, whom the Stevensons treated as their own. She is survived by her daughters, Susan Brown of Manhattan and Laura Maslon of Venice, Calif.; her niece and foster daughter, Francine Ringold-Johnson of Tulsa, Okla.; two grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.         In 1956 when all the children were in school, Mrs. Stevenson joined the board of the American Theater Wing, and when Helen Menken, then the president, died in 1965, she was elected president. She stepped down to become its chairman in 1998 and the next year was honored at a tribute at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.         The Theater Wing was known as the Stage Women's War Relief Fund when it was founded in 1917. It was renamed the American Theater Wing War Service Theater in 1939 and was known for its Stage Door Canteens in Manhattan and elsewhere. After the war, the wing established not only the Tonys Awards but also the Professional Training School, a theater school for returning soldiers, which existed from 1946 to 1965.         In 1980 a caricature of Mrs. Stevenson became the 1,000th likeness to join the gallery of theatrical figures at Sardi's Restaurant. In 1999 she received a special Tony Award for lifetime achievement.         ''I stood on the sidelines for half a century and watched other people receive Tony Awards,'' she said, ''and now at last I get my own.''
