         Suzie Frankfurt, an interior decorator who popularized 18th- and 19th-century Russian furniture among corporate raiders of the 1970's and 1980's and was an early collaborator of Andy Warhol, died on Jan. 7 at the Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale, in the Bronx. She was 73.         She had lived in Norfolk, Conn., until she became incapacitated several years ago after treatment of a brain tumor, her family said.         A bohemian hostess, the flame-haired Ms. Frankfurt was known as a creative catalyst as well as a celebrity decorator. The designer Gianni Versace, for example, credited her with introducing him to America when he was largely unknown, not to mention also introducing him to Studio 54.         The guest lists of her idiosyncratic cocktail parties included such unlikely pairings as Bill Blass and the jazz-rock group Blood, Sweat & Tears.         Ms. Frankfurt was born Suzanne Allen on Aug. 21, 1931, in Los Angeles, the daughter of Eva and Isidore Allen, the owner of a linen distribution company. A cousin was married to a son of the industrialist Norton Simon, and through that association she became part of a well-connected extended family that included the actress Jennifer Jones, who was married to Simon, and Simon's sister, Marcia Weisman, a prominent art collector.         After graduating with honors from Stanford, Ms. Allen moved to New York to work in the research department of the Young & Rubicam advertising agency, whose accounts included Norton Simon's food conglomerate. In 1956, she married Stephen O. Frankfurt, a graphic designer who was one of the agency's art directors; he later designed the titles for the film ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' and eventually became the president of Young & Rubicam. The couple divorced in 1968.         She is survived by her sons, Jaime and Peter, both of Los Angeles, and four grandchildren.         Research proved not to be Ms. Frankfurt's forte. Instead, she was given the responsibility of redecorating Young & Rubicam's lobby and executive conference rooms. Thirty years later, she had become one of the world's most admired interior decorators with a varied list of clients, including Robert Redford, Robert Mapplethorpe and a Florida bank chairman later convicted of fraud named David L. Paul. He was accused of paying Ms. Frankfurt some $389,000 in bank funds to decorate his home.         Connoisseur magazine called her a ''nostalgic romantic,'' explaining that her taste reflected an admiration for ''the ancient regime -- any regime, and the madder the king, the better.''         Ms. Frankfurt lived as well as she decorated, in a succession of town houses on the Upper East Side, all packed with Biedermeier and Russian antiques. ''I made Russian chic,'' she said in an interview with W magazine in 1993. ''Now, it's too chic.''         Though articles about Ms. Frankfurt's interior designs appeared frequently in Architectural Digest, The New York Times and other publications, she also occupied a small but significant niche in American art history, thanks to her friendship with Mr. Warhol.         She and Mr. Warhol met in 1959, and the friendship lasted a lifetime. In fact, the index of Mr. Warhol's published diaries has 34 entries for Ms. Frankfurt.         The first encounter occurred at Serendipity, an Upper East Side ice cream parlor, after she saw an exhibition of his watercolors. Their rapport was instantaneous, though tinged with opportunism. ''The only reason Andy liked me was because I was raised in Malibu with movie stars like Myrna Loy all around,'' Ms. Frankfurt said in an interview in The New York Observer years later. ''I liked Andy because I'd always felt my whole life that I was an outsider.''         Within the year, Ms. Frankfurt and Mr. Warhol produced ''Wild Raspberries,'' a spoof of haute cuisine cookbooks; the title was a tongue-in-cheek allusion to ''Wild Strawberries,'' the Ingmar Bergman film. Warhol illustrated the slender volume, which was colored by schoolchildren. The calligraphy text was the work of the artist's mother, Julia Warhola. Ms. Frankfurt prepared the recipes, which sounded like a cross between Julia Child and Edward Gorey, and included Omelette Greta Garbo (''always to be eaten alone in a candlelit room''). ,         ''Wild Raspberries'' failed to find an audience outside its creators' friends and families. It was probably just as well: only a few dozen copies were printed, each hand-bound by rabbis on the Lower East Side. In 1997, however, the book was reprinted by Bulfinch Press and received admiring reviews as an oddity.         Ms. Frankfurt herself called it ''a little dippy.''         Correction:  January 18, 2005, Tuesday  Because of an editing error, an obituary yesterday about Suzie Frankfurt, a New York decorator who was a friend and collaborator of Andy Warhol's, misstated the place of her first meeting with him. It was at the Plaza Hotel after she had seen an exhibition of his watercolors at the restaurant Serendipity; they did not meet at Serendipity.       
         Naomi Leff, an interior designer who created elegant spaces for celebrities and retailers like Ralph Lauren, Ferragamo, Gucci, Giorgio Armani and Helena Rubinstein, died on Sunday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 66.         The cause was complications of liver disease, her friend Barbara Ashley said.         She was not widely known by the public because she tended to work for wealthy, private customers. Among her residential clients were Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg, David Geffen, Barry Diller, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, and Mike Nichols and Diane Sawyer, her firm said.         Ms. Leff first attracted wide attention in 1986, when she transformed the Rhinelander Mansion at Madison Avenue and 72nd Street, built in 1898, into the flagship store for Polo Ralph Lauren.         As a profile of Ms. Leff for The New York Times in 1989 reported, she pieced together the building from the few original plans that remained, uncovering the site of the original staircase, and ''designed a grand mahogany stair that looks as though it has always been there.'' Similarly, she had ornamental plasterwork recast from surviving fragments so that it, too, appeared original. Writing in 1992, Paul Goldberger, The Times's architectural critic, called this ''the most successful conversion of a New York house into a luxury emporium since Cartier took over the former Morton Plant residence on Fifth Avenue.'' He said it achieved ''just the right balance between beautiful objects for sale and beautiful objects placed to enhance the experience of being in a stage set.''         By that time, Ms. Leff had designed interiors for Neiman-Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman and had worked from 1975 to 1980 as the senior designer for Bloomingdale's. She then designed interiors for yachts and private planes and the famously expensive Park Hyatt Beaver Creek Resort in Telluride, Colo.         Preferring what she called ''a modernist, minimalist aesthetic'' with occasional flourishes of Art Nouveau or Art Deco, she was able to capture almost any era or mood.         ''Architects tend to scorn interior decorators,'' said Paige Rense, the editor in chief of Architectural Digest, which published many articles about Ms. Leff's work and picked her as one of 30 or so Deans of Design in a recent issue. ''No architect scorned Naomi Leff, and she worked with some of the best.''         Ms. Leff was born on Aug. 4, 1939, in the Parkchester section of the Bronx, to Frank Leff, who worked for the American Jewish Committee, and Johanna Leff, a teacher in the New York City school system. She attended the High School of Music and Art in Manhattan, then received a Bachelor of Science degree from SUNY Cortland and a master's in sociology at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. Her parents survive her.         After teaching elementary school in the New York City public school system for a few years, Ms. Leff enrolled at Pratt Institute, earning a master's in environment design with a minor in architecture. In 1980 she opened her own design office, Naomi Leff & Associates, concentrating at first on retail and residential design.         She took an all-encompassing approach. At Shearson Lehman Hutton's Saddle Ridge Conference Center in Beaver Creek, Colo., for example, she put together an extensive, museum-quality collection of American West antique furnishings and artifacts that is now considered one of the best of its kind. Ms. Leff also designed the company's planes, a Gulfstream III and a Gulfstream IV.       
         Simone Simon, the French actress of near-feline beauty best known to American audiences for her haunting role in the 1942 RKO horror film ''Cat People,'' died on Tuesday in Paris. She was 93.         Her death was announced by her friends and family to Agence France-Presse.         In ''Cat People'' Ms. Simon played a Serbian-born wife who fears that when her passions are aroused she will turn into a panther that kills. Her casting in this film and its mostly unrelated sequel, ''The Curse of the Cat People'' (RKO, 1944), was probably inspired by her role as the devil's emissary in ''All That Money Can Buy'' (RKO, 1941), an adaptation of Stephen Vincent Benet's short story ''The Devil and Daniel Webster,'' in which Ms. Simon's character steals a good man from his wife.         Ms. Simon made one other film for RKO, ''Mademoiselle Fifi'' (1944), an adaptation of two Guy de Maupassant stories about a French laundress who defies occupying German forces during the Franco-Prussian war. Although it was not a hit in the United States, it was the first American film to be shown in France after the Normandy invasion.         Ms. Simon was born on April 23, 1911, in Bèthune, France, to Henri Louis Firmin and Erma Maria Domenica Giorcelli. She grew up in Marseilles. After working briefly in Paris as a fashion designer and model, she made her stage debut in 1931 in the operetta ''Balthazar.''         The same year she appeared in her first film, ''Le Chanteur Inconnu'' (''The Unknown Singer''). After making about a dozen movies, she was summoned to Hollywood by Darryl Zanuck, the head of 20th Century Fox, to repeat her French ingénue roles, but despite her considerable acting talent and her distinctive looks, she failed to connect with a mass audience. The studio even tried to make her a singing star in ''Love and Hisses'' (1937) and ''Josette'' (1938), but she had a weak voice. Except for the four RKO films, her American work is largely forgotten.         In 1950 she returned to Europe to make films including ''La Ronde'' (1950) and ''Le Modèle,'' one of the three de Maupassant stories in the anthology ''Le Plaisir'' (1952); both were directed by Max Ophüls. Her last appearance was in Michel Deville's ''Femme en Bleu'' (1973).       
         Helen Woodhull, a prominent New York jewelry designer whose work echoed ancient and antique themes in silver, gold and precious stones, died on Jan. 29 at her home in the West Village in Manhattan. She was 65.         The death was announced on her Web site, www.woodhulljewelry.com. Andrea Goodman of Lenox, Mass., a friend, said she appeared to have suffered a stroke, and no autopsy was performed.         In the course of nearly 40 years, Ms. Woodhull operated three stores on the Upper East Side, furnished designs for sale at Tiffany, Cartier and Georg Jensen, and for the last 10 years was associated exclusively with James Robinson Inc., a Park Avenue firm dealing mostly in antique jewelry, silver and porcelain. She created more than 300 distinctive pieces of jewelry patterned after Egyptian amulets, Chinese jade or intricate Greek and Roman intaglios carved, incised and engraved into stone or metal. Her work became part of private collections throughout the world.         A native of Morristown, N. J., Helen Woodhull studied at the Parsons School of Design but did not graduate. Instead, according to Ms. Goodman and Joan Boening, the president of James Robinson, she came into her career as much by happenstance as by choice.         After Parsons, she traveled widely and returned awed by history and historical designs, bringing back a trove of collector's pieces that she sold at her first shop, The Leogryph, which she opened near the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1965.         Soon, customers would ask her to mount a newly bought amulet to wear. At first she was reluctant to tamper with ancient objects, but she said she realized that they had been created to adorn an ancient's body in the first place and started creating suitable settings for them.         Eventually she decided to create her own jewelry, assisted for the last 30 years by a master jeweler, John Chirinian, who will continue to work with her designs, Ms. Boening said.         Ms. Woodhull closed the first store in 1968 and designed jewelry for Georg Jensen. She was one of the few young designers working under their own names for Tiffany and Cartier. In the late 1970's she opened her second store on Madison Avenue at 65th Street, and she moved it to Fifth Avenue and 57th Street in 1988.         She closed that store in 1994 but continued to design.         Ms. Woodhull is survived by three sisters, Anne Woodhull of Westfield, N.J., and Charlotte and Katherine Woodhull of Morristown.       
         Sara Stein, an influential advocate for gardening with native plants, died Feb. 25 at her home in Vinalhaven, Me. She was 69.         The cause was lung cancer, said her husband, Martin Stein.         In ''Noah's Garden: Restoring the Ecology of Our Own Backyards'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1993), Ms. Stein lamented the effects of traditional suburban landscaping on her six-acre homestead in Pound Ridge, N.Y., three acres of which were scraped in the 1930's to provide topsoil for the 1939 New York World's Fair.         She wrote how she and her husband had undertaken the process of ''ungardening,'' or changing what had become an environment of sterile lawn and plantings into carefully researched ecosystems representing swamp, prairie, rock barren and other native environments. The result attracted birds, small mammals and other wildlife.         ''Noah's Garden,'' which mingled good-humored anecdotes about her family with widely applicable advice, caught the attention of gardeners and homeowners around the country and became a bible for a growing native landscape movement. Ms. Stein was soon in demand as a speaker to gardening and environmental groups.         She followed the book with ''Planting Noah's Garden: Further Adventures in Backyard Ecology'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1997) and ''Noah's Children: Restoring the Ecology of Childhood'' (North Point Press, 2001), a meditation on the role the natural environment plays in childhood development.         Ms. Stein was born Sara Bonnett in Manhattan on Oct. 7, 1935, the second of three daughters of Earl Clough Bonnett, an insurance medical examiner, and Sara Bonnett, a psychoanalyst. She attended Cornell College for a year and earned her bachelor's degree in Russian studies at the New School for Social Research. In 1959, she married Mr. Stein, an architect.         In addition to her husband, Ms. Stein is survived by four sons, Lincoln, of Glen Cove, N.Y.; Rafael, of Ramsey, N.J.; Joshua, of Acton, Mass.; and Aram, of Richmond, Calif.; two sisters, Suzanne Caffuzzi, of Manhattan, and Diantha Guessous, of Rabat, Morocco; and six grandchildren.         Ms. Stein began her career as a toy designer, which led to her writing children's books. She started off in 1974 with a series on sensitive subjects like hospitals, dying and handicaps. The books were subtitled ''An Open Family Book for Parents and Children Together'' (Walker & Company). In 1979 she added ''On Divorce'' and ''The Adopted One'' to the series, and in 1983 ''About Phobias'' and ''Making Babies.'' The same year she published ''Girls and Boys: The Limits of Nonsexist Childrearing'' (Scribner's).         Among her other books is a series on how to raise various pets that led to ''Great Pets: An Extraordinary Guide to Usual and Unusual Family Pets'' (Workman, 1976).         Another series explained science to children and included ''The Science Book'' (Workman, 1980), ''The Evolution Book'' (Workman, 1986) and ''The Body Book'' (Workman, 1992). Ms. Stein's focus turned to gardening with ''My Weeds: A Gardener's Botany'' (1988).         Ms. Stein, who sometimes illustrated her own books, created a handmade dollhouse that was exhibited at the Museum of the City of New York for more than a year and became the basis of ''A Family Dollhouse'' (Viking, 1979).       
         Faith McNulty, a New Yorker staff writer who wrote many books about animals and country life for adults and children, died last Sunday at her home in Wakefield, R.I. She was 86. The cause was complications of a stroke, her sister, Elisabeth Keiffer, said.         In 1980, Ms. McNulty notably departed from her usual subjects with "The Burning Bed: The True Story of an Abused Wife" (Harcourt), an account of how in 1977 Francine Hughes, a battered Michigan housewife, killed her husband by setting him on fire after he passed out from drinking. She was acquitted of murder by reason of temporary insanity.         In 1984, the book was made into an NBC-TV movie, with a de-glamorized Farrah Fawcett as the star. The film enhanced Ms. Hughes's image as an advocate for women's rights.         But Ms. McNulty's more usual line of work was books like "The Whooping Crane: The Bird That Defies Extinction" (Dutton, 1966) and "How to Dig a Hole to the Other Side of the World" (Harper, 1979), with illustrations by Marc Simont.         Ms. McNulty came to her interests early. Although a city child, born in New York on Nov. 28, 1918, she spent her childhood summers on her grandmother's farm in Wakefield. Her father, Joseph Eugene Corrigan, was a judge. Her original name was Faith Trumbull Corrigan.         Intending to become a writer, she attended Barnard College in 1937-38, but dropped out after a creative-writing teacher told her she had no talent.         In 1938, she married Charles M. Fair, a writer. The marriage ended in divorce. In 1945, she married John McNulty. She met him about 1942, her sister said in a telephone interview, when she was one of the first three copy girls hired by The Daily News, where he was a rewrite man. He had begun to sell stories to The New Yorker, and went to work there in 1944. He helped her to sell her first piece to the magazine. A decade later, in 1953, she was hired by the editor William Shawn as a Talk of the Town reporter.         After her husband's death, in 1956, Ms. McNulty settled permanently on a farm they had bought in Wakefield and began to write books. In 1957, she married Richard H. Martin, a prop designer for the theater. He died in 1984.         In addition to her sister, Ms. McNulty is survived by a son, John Joseph McNulty of Brooklyn, and four grandchildren.       
         Geraldine Stutz, who transformed Henri Bendel from a carriage trade retailer in decline into a chic emporium of designer brands in the 1960's, died yesterday at her home in New York. She was 80.         Her death came after a long illness, said her stepdaughter, Emma Turner.         Ms. Stutz is best known for her 29-year career as the president of Henri Bendel, with a legendary eye for discovering the newest designers and using them first, installing their collections in elaborately merchandised departments that heralded the introduction of a new generation of fashion stars -- Stephen Burrows, Perry Ellis, Jean Muir, Sonia Rykiel, Carlos Falchi, Mary McFadden, Holly Harp and Ralph Lauren among them.         Many longtime Bendel shoppers recall Ms. Stutz's 1958 overhaul of the main floor at the store, at 10 West 57th Street, into a U-shaped ''Street of Shops'' widely acknowledged as a precursor to modern shop-in-shop merchandising displays. Based on her taste alone, Ms. Stutz divided merchandise into small vitrines of watches, handbags, stockings, and along one side, an inspiring ''Gilded Cage,'' a giant replica of a birdcage that housed the cosmetics department.         ''Geraldine had a vision of the kind of store she wanted to create,'' said Jean Rosenberg, who was the vice president and merchandising director at Bendel's from six months before Ms. Stutz's arrival in 1957 to their joint departure in 1986, after the store was sold to The Limited. ''It was for a particular kind of New York woman, where she could find a uniformity of taste and a certain amount of comfort in a smallish environment, where everything in one store was to her liking.''         Ms. Stutz was born in Chicago on Aug. 5, 1924. She aspired to an acting career and studied drama at Mundelein College before changing her focus to journalism. She moved to New York to be closer to the theater and found work as a fashion editor for movie magazines, and in 1947 was hired as an associate fashion editor for Glamour magazine, where she covered shoes.         Colleagues described Ms. Stutz as an industrious learner who immersed herself in the subject matter. Grace Mirabella, the former editor of Mirabella magazine, recalled an introduction to Ms. Stutz in the early 1950's, when Ms. Mirabella was working at Vogue. ''She loved to talk about the business and what was going on behind the scenes, and she knew everything about shoes,'' Ms. Mirabella said.         Ms. Stutz put her knowledge to practical use when she went to work for several footwear manufacturers, including I. Miller, the company for which Andy Warhol designed advertisements, after it was sold to the conglomerate Genesco. Maxey Jarman, its president, recognized in Ms. Stutz an ability for merchandising and advertising, and named her to run the Henri Bendel store in 1957. ''Jarman had talked to her at great length about her vision for the store,'' Ms. Rosenberg said. ''It was not going to be a store for everybody.''         Bendel's was known at various times as a hat shop and as the source of the Duke of Windsor's wardrobe, but Ms. Stutz's concept was narrowly focused on a young, sophisticated urban woman, and she rarely ordered clothes larger than size 10. In an article in New York magazine in 1987, Ms. Stutz described her taste for what she called ''dog whistle'' fashion: ''clothes with a pitch so high and special that only the thinnest and most sophisticated women would hear their call.'' She was also one of the first retailers to consider merchandising food and furniture alongside fashion, and she made way for the in-store designer boutique in the late 1960's, as she did for Ms. Rykiel.         ''She recognized that fashion was more than just about clothing; it was about lifestyle and how one lives,'' said Joan Kaner, the fashion director of Neiman Marcus, who worked under Ms. Stutz from 1967 to 1976. ''She thought to put in perfumed candles and potpourri at the entrances so that when people walked in, they got this wonderful aroma. She was born with impeccable taste, and practically brought over every European designer who ever came to America.''         Ms. Stutz's Street of Shops replaced what was formerly a dimly lit floor with merchandise randomly displayed along a 100-foot corridor. She installed marble floors and boutiques, small shops within the larger store that changed each season, stocked with exclusive merchandise culled from markets around the world -- a flower shop, stationery, a tiny art gallery, tabletop items from Frank MacIntosh, Lee Bailey's home displays, and a boutique called ''Port of Call'' with objects from Vietnam and Thailand.         Ms. Rosenberg recalled her instructions to travel to Paris to explore the new market for ready-to-wear in 1959, when Ms. Stutz told her, ''Buy anything you want.''         ''It was a store that was edited like a magazine,'' Ms. Mirabella said. ''It was everybody's meeting place on Saturdays or at Christmastime.''         Ms. Stutz took the in-store-shop concept further in the late 1960's with boutiques dedicated to the collections of designers she felt could succeed with the store's support. Stephen Burrows opened his boutique there in 1969, an experience he recalled as a defining moment of his career (one he replicated in 2002 at Bendel's current site: 712 Fifth Avenue).         In 1980, Ms. Stutz assembled a team of investors and acquired the store from Genesco. Five years later she sold her interest, and worked as a publisher with Random House, overseeing books on Andy Warhol and Elsie de Wolfe. She also continued to consult with designers and retailers through a practice called GSG Group, which she founded in 1993.         Ms. Stutz's mid-1960's marriage to David Gibbs, an art dealer and painter, ended in divorce, her stepdaughter, Ms. Turner, said.         Robert Rufino, the vice president of creative services at Tiffany & Co., is one of the many retail executives who found their start with Ms. Stutz. He designed windows for the company in the 1970's, and recalled Ms. Stutz's ability to intermingle her interests in art and film with fashion.         ''In those days, there was nothing else like Henri Bendel,'' Mr. Rufino said. ''It was like working for the best house in the world. To take this little town house and make it look like someone lived there, as you were going from room to room -- it was just one woman's vision on the world of fashion, and yet it did incredibly well.''       
         Louise Westergaard O'Neil, a theatrical producer best known for the hit Broadway musical revue ''Sophisticated Ladies,'' died on May 6 in New York. She was 67 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was leukemia, her family said.         Based on the music of Duke Ellington, ''Sophisticated Ladies,'' which starred Gregory Hines, Judith Jamison and Hinton Battle, opened in 1981 at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater and ran for nearly two years. Mr. Battle won a Tony Award, as did the costume designer, Willa Kim.         Ms. O'Neil, known professionally as Louise Westergaard, was one of several producers of ''Sophisticated Ladies.'' She was so confident of the show's chances that she even persuaded her mother's dry cleaner to become an investor.         She was also a producer, on Broadway, of ''Say Goodnight, Gracie,'' starring Frank Gorshin as George Burns, which ran for 10 months in 2002 and 2003, and of the musical revues ''Dream'' (1997) and ''Stardust'' (1987).         Ms. O'Neil's productions elsewhere included ''Tovah: Out of Her Mind,'' starring Tovah Feldshuh, at the Jewish Repertory Theater in 1996; and the musical ''Poppy,'' by Peter Nichols, staged by the Royal Shakespeare Company in London in 1982.         Louise Arnold was born in Manhattan on Sept. 2, 1937, and earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago. She was later artistic director of Theater of the Open Eye, a New York-based company founded by the choreographer Jean Erdman and her husband, the mythologist Joseph Campbell.         Ms. O'Neil's first marriage, to John Westergaard, ended in divorce. She is survived by her husband, Stephen O'Neil, whom she married in 1989; two sons and two daughters from her first marriage, Emile, Kermit, Cathrine and Elizabeth; and three grandchildren.       
         Clare Lynch O'Brien, an author, editor and consultant to children's television, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 62.         The cause was breast cancer, her sister Eileen Lynch Sussan said.         Mrs. O'Brien was a senior children's editor at Random House and a longtime colleague of Fred Rogers, the children's television host. Together they wrote ''Mr. Rogers Talks With Families About Divorce.'' She was also a consultant for ''Big Blue Marble,'' a children's show on public television. She later worked as an interior designer.         Clare Lynch was born in Manhattan on April 23, 1943, and graduated from the State University of New York at Cortland in 1965. She married Richard F. O'Brien, an advertising executive, in 1973. They lived in Manhattan, Washington and Nantucket, Mass.         In addition to her husband and her sister Eileen, of Stamford, Conn., Mrs. O'Brien is survived by her daughter, Kate, of Nantucket; her son, Miles, of Cockeysville, Md.; her brothers Daniel Lynch of Richmond, Va., and Thomas Lynch, of Greenwich, Conn.; and three other sisters, Moira Crabtree of West Caldwell, N.J., Sheila Casey of Washington and Elizabeth Berman of Los Angeles.       
         Barbara Bel Geddes, a critically acclaimed stage, screen and television actress known for her work with Alfred Hitchcock in the 1950's and, more recently, for her role as Miss Ellie, the matriarch of the fractious Ewing clan on the long-running nighttime soap opera ''Dallas,'' died on Monday at her home in Northeast Harbor, Me. She was 82.         The Jordan-Fernald Funeral Home in Mount Desert, Me., confirmed the death to The Associated Press, giving no cause. The San Francisco Chronicle reported yesterday that Ms. Bel Geddes had died of lung cancer.         On Broadway Ms. Bel Geddes was best known as the original Maggie the Cat in Tennessee Williams's ''Cat on Hot Tin Roof,'' which opened in 1955. She also appeared in ''The Moon Is Blue'' (1951) and ''Silent Night, Lonely Night'' (1959). Her film credits include Hitchcock's ''Vertigo'' (1958); ''Caught'' (1949), directed by Max Ophüls; and ''Panic in the Streets'' (1950), directed by Elia Kazan.         On television Ms. Bel Geddes starred in several episodes of Hitchcock's weekly series ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents'' during the late 1950's and early 1960's. In 1980 she won the Emmy Award for best actress in a dramatic series for her role on ''Dallas.''         Blond, soft-spoken and slightly plump as a young woman, Ms. Bel Geddes projected a resolute, even steely, intelligence beneath her cherubic exterior. It was a quality Hitchcock used to great effect, notably in ''Vertigo,'' in which Ms. Bel Geddes played Midge, the steadfast, unglamorous ex-fiancée of Jimmy Stewart, who watches his painful descent into obsession and madness.         Hitchcock used her memorably again in ''Lamb to the Slaughter,'' widely considered one of the finest episodes of ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents.'' Broadcast in the spring of 1958, it starred Ms. Bel Geddes as a wife who murders her philandering husband by bludgeoning him with a frozen leg of lamb. When detectives show up to investigate the death, the murder weapon is nowhere to be found. Ms. Bel Geddes, smiling a tiny, knowing smile, sits them down to a home-cooked meal.         Barbara Bel Geddes was born in New York on Oct. 31, 1922. Her father was Norman Bel Geddes, the architect and stage designer. She made her Broadway debut in 1941 in the forgettable play ''Out of the Frying Pan.'' She went on to win a Theater World Award in 1946 for her performance in ''Deep Are the Roots,'' which Kazan directed.         Soon afterward, Ms. Bel Geddes went to Hollywood, where she starred opposite Henry Fonda in her first film, ''The Long Night'' (1947). Although she was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance as Katrin Hanson, the daughter of Norwegian immigrants in ''I Remember Mama'' (1948), Ms. Bel Geddes made relatively few movies, working primarily in theater and television. Her other film credits include ''Blood on the Moon'' (1948), ''Fourteen Hours'' (1951) and ''The Five Pennies'' (1959).         Ms. Bel Geddes's greatest critical acclaim came as Maggie, the restless young wife in a decaying family of Mississippi planters in ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.'' Reviewing her performance in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson called it ''vital, lovely and frank.''         Her other Broadway credits include ''The Living Room'' (1954), by Graham Greene; ''The Sleeping Prince'' (1956), by Terence Rattigan; and ''Mary, Mary'' (1961), by Jean Kerr.         Ms. Bel Geddes appeared on ''Dallas'' in two installments, the first from 1978 to 1984, when she retired after heart surgery. She was replaced as Miss Ellie by Donna Reed, who sued to retain the role after the show's producers reinstated Ms. Bel Geddes in 1985. Ms. Reed lost her bid, and Ms. Bel Geddes remained in the role until 2000.         Ms. Bel Geddes's first marriage, to Carl Schreuer, an engineer, ended in divorce. Her second husband, Windsor Lewis, a theater director, died before her. She is survived by a daughter, Susan, from her first marriage, and a daughter, Betsy, from her second.         In addition to acting, Ms. Bel Geddes also worked as a professional artist. She wrote and illustrated two children's books, ''I Like to Be Me'' (Viking, 1963) and ''So Do I'' (Arbor House, 1972).         Looking back on her career, Ms. Bel Geddes expressed amusement that she was so often cast as patricians. ''They're always making me play well-bred ladies,'' she told People magazine in 1982. She added, ''I'm not very well bred, and I'm not much of a lady.''         Correction:  August 13, 2005, Saturday  An obituary of the actress Barbara Bel Geddes on Thursday misstated the year of her final appearance on the television show ''Dallas.'' It was 1990, not 2000. A picture caption referred incorrectly to the character she played. It was Miss Ellie, not Ms. Ellie.       
         Honey Bruce Friedman, a former nightclub entertainer who in 2003 helped win a posthumous pardon for her ex-husband, the comedian Lenny Bruce, on a 39-year-old obscenity conviction, died on Sept. 12 at a hospital in Honolulu. She was 78 and a Honolulu resident.         The cause was complications of colitis, her daughter, Kitty Bruce, said.         At various times a singer, dancer, stripper, carnival performer, film actress, clothing designer and memoirist, Ms. Friedman was married to Bruce from 1951 until their divorce in 1957. Bruce died of a drug overdose in 1966, at 40.         In 2003, Gov. George E. Pataki of New York pardoned Bruce, who was convicted in 1964 of giving obscene performances at the Cafe au Go Go in Greenwich Village. With her daughter, Ms. Friedman lent her support to the campaign to win the pardon.         Ms. Friedman was born Harriett Jolliff in Manila, Ark., on Aug. 15, 1927, and raised in Detroit. As a teenager, she ran away from home to dance with a carnival. While still in her teens, she was convicted, along with several friends, of attempting to rob a candy machine, and spent more than a year in jail.         Shortly after her release, she began working as a stripper under the name Hot Honey Harlowe. After an early marriage that ended in divorce, she wed Bruce, breaking off a relationship with a woman she loved to be with him.         The couple's six-year marriage was Ozzie and Harriet as reimagined by William S. Burroughs. Ms. Friedman sewed outfits for Bruce. They shopped for wallpaper. They injected heroin. She served jail time for marijuana possession.         In later years, Ms. Friedman, who overcame addictions to drugs and alcohol, designed clothing, with a shop in Honolulu. She was the author of a memoir, ''Honey: The Life and Loves of Lenny's Shady Lady'' (Playboy Press, 1976, with Dana Benenson).         Ms. Friedman appeared in two films, ''Dance Hall Racket'' (1953), which also starred Bruce and his mother, Sally Marr; and ''Princess of the Nile'' (1954). She was featured in the 1998 documentary ''Lenny Bruce: Swear to Tell the Truth,'' and was portrayed by Valerie Perrine in Bob Fosse's film ''Lenny'' (1974).         Besides her daughter, who lives in Pennsylvania, Ms. Friedman is survived by her husband, Jeffrey Friedman, whom she married in 1984.       
         Sybil Shearer, an unpredictable individualist of modern dance, died on Thursday in Evanston, Ill. She was 93 and lived in Northbrook, Ill.         The cause was a stroke, said Toby Nicholson of the Morrison-Shearer Foundation and Museum.         A dancer of extraordinary agility, Ms. Shearer depicted both spiritual visions and human foibles. As the dance historian Margaret Lloyd wrote in ''The Borzoi Book of Modern Dance,'' ''Sybil Shearer is a perfectionist who likes to believe that perfection is humanly attainable.''         In her youth, she was sometimes compared to another experimental dancer, Merce Cunningham. When both gave separate programs at the American Dance Festival at Connecticut College in 1959, Doris Hering concluded in Dance Magazine: ''Both are mystics. Both move as though chosen by the wind.''         Ms. Shearer's first New York solo concert in 1941 attracted considerable attention, but less than two years later she abruptly abandoned what she considered the rat race of New York and settled in the Chicago suburbs. Making only sporadic returns to New York, she continued performing in the Chicago area and inspired dedicated students, among them John Neumeier, now the director of the Hamburg Ballet.         Ever idiosyncratic, Ms. Shearer rejected stage makeup and let her abundant reddish-brown hair hang loose during performances. She sometimes refused to take curtain calls and occasionally presented long evenings without intermissions.         Born in Toronto, Ms. Shearer grew up in Nyack, N.Y., and on Long Island. She studied ballet with various local teachers and acquired a virtuoso technique. The summer after she graduated from Skidmore College in 1934, she was drawn by a newfound interest in modern dance to Bennington College, then a center of modern-dance ferment.         At first, she specialized in solos. Some -- for instance, ''Let the Heavens Open That the Earth May Shine'' (1947) -- celebrated spiritual ideals. Others commented on earthly problems: ''In a Vacuum'' (1941) portrayed an assembly-line worker with physically demanding but unrelated movements that suggested dehumanization. Still other pieces were whimsical. ''Once Upon a Time'' (1951) was a suite of solos for fantastically named characters. Thus Medmiga was an ominous witch, Yanchi was fey, Relluckus was woebegone and Ziff fluttered aimlessly. Ms. Shearer once told the dancer Stuart Hodes that all these creatures ''live in my garden at home.'' Ms. Shearer also choreographed group works, among them ''Fables and Proverbs'' (1961) and ''The Reflection in the Puddle Is Mine'' (1963).         Many of her productions were close collaborations with Helen Morrison, a photographer, filmmaker and lighting designer who meticulously documented Ms. Shearer's career. The Morrison-Shearer Foundation and Museum maintains the Shearer archives. In recent years, Ms. Shearer became a dance writer; her criticism as Chicago correspondent for Ballet Review combined shrewd appraisals with evocative metaphors. The first volume of her autobiography, is to be published next year.         No immediate survivors are known.
