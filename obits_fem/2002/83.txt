        Torunn Atteraas Garin, a chemical engineer who worked on notable food projects, died last Friday at her home in Bronxville, N.Y. She was 54 and also had a home on Tortola, in the British Virgin Islands.
        She cause was lung cancer, her family said.
        Working for General Foods from 1971 to 1985, Mrs. Garin helped develop the sweetener aspartame as a sugar substitute and was a national spokeswoman for the product.
        Early in her career, she worked on minimizing water pollution resulting from food production, substituting natural dyes for cancer-causing chemicals and developing a process to extract caffeine from coffee, for which she was awarded two patents.
        A native of Bergen, Norway, she studied at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and received a degree in chemical engineering from Columbia in 1971. She received a master's in environmental engineering at what is now Polytechnic University in Brooklyn in 1977.
        Mrs. Garin is survived by her husband, Michael N.; their three sons, Kristoffer A. of Manhattan, and Aleksander A. and Nickolas A. of Bronxville; and her sister, Lillian Daviknes of Hvalstad, Norway.
