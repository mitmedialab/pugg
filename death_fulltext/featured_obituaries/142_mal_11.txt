        Jerry L. Schwartz, a journeyman journalist who was equally comfortable writing about baseball and Beethoven, died on Sunday at Northside Hospital in Atlanta. He was 51 and lived in Atlanta.
        The cause was complications from leukemia, said Jonathan Wax, a family friend.
        As the founder of a one-person freelance writing business called The Atlanta Bureau, Mr. Schwartz wrote and contributed to hundreds of articles for news organizations including The New York Times, Reuters, and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
        A native of Memphis, he earned a degree in journalism from the University of Missouri in 1969 before joining the staff of The Miami Herald and then of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
        He is survived by his wife, Carolyn Harmon Schwartz, the press secretary to former President Jimmy Carter and the director of public information for the Carter Center; a daughter, Elizabeth Rose Schwartz of Atlanta; a son, Max David Schwartz of Atlanta, his mother, Mildred Schwartz of Memphis, and a sister, Vivian K. Poole, of Memphis.
