        Robert Lowry, a writer whose novels and short stories about World War II and life in Greenwich Village in the postwar years were popular in the 1940's and 50's, died on Dec. 5 at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Cincinnati. He was 75.
        He had been hospitalized in October for treatment of an irregular heartbeat and then developed pneumonia, said his son Beirne, of Manhattan.
        Mr. Lowry's work was drawn from his youth in Ohio, his experiences on the battlefields of Tunisia and Italy during World War II and his life as an artist in Greenwich Village. Mr. Lowry created simple characters and wrote about their vulnerabilities in clean, spare prose.
        His best-known works were "Casualty" (1946), "Find Me in Fire" (1948), "The Big Cage" (1949), "The Violent Wedding" (1953), "The Prince of Pride Starring" (1959) and three collections of short stories, "The Wolf That Fed Us" (1949), "Happy New Year, Kamerades" (1954) and "Party of Dreamers" (1962).
        One of his stories, "That Kind of Woman," became a movie in 1959, directed by Sidney Lumet and starring Sophia Loren.
        In 1950, he won the O. Henry Award for his story "Be Nice to Mr. Campbell."
        Mr. Lowry's four marriages ended in divorce. In addition to his son Beirne, he is survived by two other sons, David, of Monterey, Calif., and Jack, of Perth Amboy, N.J., and a sister, Ruth Lowry of New Haven.
