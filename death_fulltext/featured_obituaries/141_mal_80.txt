        Ormonde de Kay, a writer, poet and magazine editor, died on Oct. 2 at Beth Israel Hospital. Mr. de Kay, who lived in Manhattan, was 74.
        He died of lung cancer, his brother George said.
        Mr. de Kay was a versatile writer who took delight in wordplay and language. He wrote dozens of documentaries, contributed to the script of the highly praised 1949 film ''Lost Boundaries,'' wrote several books that combined his affection for light verse and French, and was the author of children's biographies of Andrew Jackson, Theodore Roosevelt and Lewis and Clark. He wrote articles on history for magazines like American Heritage and Horizon, where he was articles editor in the 1970's, and he contributed light verse to The New Yorker, Harper's and The Atlantic Monthly.
        His ''Rimes de la Mere Oie,'' a 1971 translation of Mother Goose that managed to retain the meter, rhyme schemes and humor of the English originals, was praised by  Robert Graves as ''a remarkable achievement and a great gift to the French.''
        In the 1980's and 90's, Mr. de Kay turned full time to freelance writing. His last book, ''From the Age That Is Past,'' published in 1994, is a history of the Harvard Club of New York.
        Mr. de Kay, who was born in New York City in 1923, graduated in 1945 from Harvard College, where he was the editor of the university literary magazine The Advocate. During World War II and the Korean War he served aboard Navy destroyer escorts. In the late 1940's and 50's he lived in Paris, London, Munich and Rome, writing radio and film scripts.  Later he helped to start Interplay, a magazine about international affairs.
        Mr. de Kay is survived by his wife, Barbara; a son, Thomas, of Manhattan; two brothers, George, of Manhattan and James Tertius of Stonington, Conn.; a stepdaughter, Lenore Roosevelt of Cudjo Key, Fla., and a stepson, Philip Roosevelt of Chappaqua, N.Y.
