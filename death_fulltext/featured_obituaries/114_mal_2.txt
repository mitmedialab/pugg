        Mr. Anderson was born in Worcester, Mass. He studied music, but decided on a career in journalism. He worked for United Press International in Roanoke, Va.,  where he also worked as a radio reporter and news director. He was a radio news  director at WJBW in New Orleans before moving to Los Angeles. His awards included an Emmy for a documentary on battered children.
        He is survived by his parents, Fred and Edna, of Tampa, Fla.; a sister, Elaine Moore of Raleigh, N.C.; a brother, Calvin, of Massachusetts, and three daughters.
