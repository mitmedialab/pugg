        Daniel H. Majeske, the concertmaster of the Cleveland Orchestra since 1969, died on Sunday at his home in Euclid, Ohio. He was 61.
        The cause was prostate cancer, said NancyBell Coe, the orchestra's manager.
        Mr. Majeske was born in Detroit in 1932 and made his orchestral debut with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra when he was 16. After studying with Ivan Galamian at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, he joined the United States Navy Band in Washington in 1951.
        During his four years in the Navy Band, Mr. Majeske also studied theology with the intention of becoming a minister. But he also wrote to George Szell, the music director of the Cleveland Orchestra, seeking an audition. Szell offered him a seat in the orchestra's first violin section. Mr. Majeske became the orchestra's assistant concertmaster in 1959 and its associate concertmaster in 1967.  A Turning Point
        When Rafael Druian abruptly resigned hours before a recording session for the Brahms Double Concerto in 1969, Mr. Majeske performed the solo violin line. Szell appointed him concertmaster the next day. He performed as a soloist with the orchestra more than 100 times, and his performance of the Martinu Concerto last April was recorded by London Records for release next year. He is also the violin soloist on the orchestra's recordings of Richard Strauss's "Also Sprach Zarathustra" and "Heldenleben" and Rimsky-Korsakov's "Scheherezade."
        Mr. Majeske gave master classes at the Cleveland Institute of Music and the Cleveland Music School Settlement, and he was the host of a classical radio program on WCRF-FM in Cleveland.
        He is survived by his wife, Marilyn; a son, Stephen, who is a violinist in the Cleveland Orchestra; a daughter, Sharon Chari of Camden, S.C., and his mother, Esther, of Scottsdale, Ariz.
