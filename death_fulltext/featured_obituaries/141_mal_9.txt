        The former chief executive of Siemens A.G., Karlheinz Kaske, died Sept. 27 after a long illness, the company reported from Munich. He was 70.
        Mr. Kaske, head of Siemens from 1981 until 1992, oversaw the growth of the German company into a global electronics and engineering giant during the 1980's. He masterminded the company's expansion overseas, particularly in the United States and East Asia, and strengthened its position in various fields, especially microelectronics.
        He also formed an alliance with the chip makers I.B.M. and Toshiba, and signed a contract to cooperate with China in the field of electronics. Mr. Kaske was also responsible for the acquisition of the computer maker Nixdorf in 1990 and the takeover, together with the General Electric Company of Britain, of the Plessey Company P.L.C., in 1989.
        Born in 1928 in Essen, Germany, Mr. Kaske joined Siemens & Halske A.G., as the company was then called, in 1950. He rose to join the management board in 1975 and six years later was named chairman.
        The acquisitions and a revamping of Siemens increased annual profits to 2 billion Deutsche marks ($1.19 billion at current exchange rates) when Mr. Kaske served as chairman. Sales during those years more than doubled, from 35 billion marks ($21 billion) to 79 billion marks ($47.2 billion). The number of employees rose to 413,000, from 338,000.
        After his retirement from Siemens, Mr. Kaske continued to serve on the boards of the Eastman Kodak Company, Linde A.G. and MAN A.G. In addition, he served in the German League of Science Foundations, the board of trustees of Munich University and as chairman of the administration board of Deutsches Museum in Munich.
