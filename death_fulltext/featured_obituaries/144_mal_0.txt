        Damon Wright, a playwright, died on Monday at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan after a long illness, his family said. He was 48 and lived in Manhattan.
        Born in Long Beach, Calif., and a graduate of Stanford University, he was the author of ''Testimony,''  ''Mr. Baldwin Goes to Heaven'' and ''The Quadroon Ball: An American Tragedy,'' among other plays. He was a member of the Usual Suspects, a community of artists at New York Theater Workshop, and had worked at the Directors' Lab at Lincoln Center Theater. Both groups mounted workshops of ''Mr. Baldwin Goes to Heaven'' in 1995 and 1996, respectively.
        ''Testimony'' was presented at Dixon Place in 1996 and ''The Quadroon Ball'' at La Mama E.T.C. in 1997, as well as at the Crossroads Theater in New Brunswick, N.J., and the Alley Theater in Houston.
        Mr. Wright, who earlier had been an administrator at Sounds in Motion, the choreographer Dianne McIntyre's company, worked for The New York Times from 1985 to 1995, most recently in the news department. His articles about experimental theater appeared in the Arts & Leisure section.
        He is survived by his parents, Artis and Birdell, and two sisters, Joni and Lydia, all of Long Beach, and a brother, Carter, of Jefferson, Tex.
