        Alekos Sakellarios, one of Greece's most prolific comic playwrights and lyricists whose works frequently portrayed the lighthearted side of crises, died on Thursday. He was 78 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Sakellarios wrote 187 stage comedies and 105 movie scripts during a career that spanned half a century. He also wrote lyrics for 1,500 songs, many of which are still popular today. But his works were little known outside Greece.
        One of his most popular plays, "The Germans Are Returning," is about an Athenian dreaming of the comic aspects of life during the 1941-44 Nazi occupation of Greece.
        Two other comedy plays, "My Daughter the Socialist" and "Rod Came From Heaven," were made into movies.
        He is survived by his wife and two daughters.
