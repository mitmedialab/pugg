        Patrick Miller, a musician who led the experimental 1980's rock group Minimal Man, died on Dec. 14 at his home in Los Angeles. He was 51.
        The cause is not yet known, said his brother, Jan, who said that an autopsy had been performed but that the results were not yet available. His brother and several friends said Mr. Miller had been suffering from hepatitis C.
        Minimal Man was one of a handful of influential groups in the late 70's and early 80's that bridged punk and industrial music with aggressive blasts of noise and electronic effects. As the leader of Minimal Man, Mr. Miller sang (or screamed), played keyboards and manipulated tape machines to create the band's din. One critic referred to its sound simply as ''antimusic.''
        The band's name, Mr. Miller once said, was inspired by people living in the ghettos of San Francisco, the city in which the group was founded. Though often without basic needs, these were people creative in adapting to life on the street. Mr. Miller's idea of Minimal Man was a character with ''everything against him,'' he said.
        Minimal Man's first album, ''The Shroud Of,'' was released in 1981. Before starting that group, he played in Tuxedomoon and collaborated with many punk and industrial musicians.
        Mr. Miller was born in Glendale, Calif., and studied art at Sonoma State University in Rohnert Park, Calif. At various times he lived in New York and in Belgium as well as San Francisco. In the early 90's he returned to Los Angeles and worked in the movie business as a set dresser.
        In addition to his brother, Mr. Miller is survived by his mother, Virginia, and two brothers, Roger and Edward, all of Los Angeles.
