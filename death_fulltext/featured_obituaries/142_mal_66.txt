        Ralph L. Wickiser, a painter and teacher who founded the fine arts graduate program at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, died on Oct. 27 in a nursing home in Riverhead, N.Y. He was 88.
        A modernist abstract painter, Mr. Wickiser drew much of his imagery from nature, particularly, in the last two decades, from the landscape near Woodstock, N.Y., where he had spent summers since 1948 and where he had lived since 1975.
        His teaching career began at Louisiana State University in 1937. In 1959 he began working at Pratt, where he administered an art department whose faculty included Franz Kline, Jacob Lawrence, Roy Lichtenstein and Philip Pearlstein. In 1962 he founded the school's Graduate Programs in Art and Design and served as director, acting dean and chairman until 1975. He also published two widely used textbooks on art education.
        He is survived by his wife, Jane;  two sons, Eric, of Bloomington, Minn., and Walter, of New York; a daughter, Lydia Anne Tortora of Mattituck, N.Y., and three sisters, Helen Pier of Granite City, Ill., Alice Taylor of Urbana, Ill., and Mary Riedy of Phoenix.
