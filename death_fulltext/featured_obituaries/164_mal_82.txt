        Richard Mulligan, who won Emmy Awards for his portrayal of fathers on the situation comedies ''Soap'' and ''Empty Nest,'' died Tuesday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 67.
        The cause was cancer, said his friend and assistant, David Fisher.
        Although he achieved his greatest success in television in the course of a career of some 40 years, Mr. Mulligan appeared frequently in films and on the Broadway stage. He portrayed a Hollywood producer in the 1981 Blake Edwards farce, ''S.O.B.,'' which also starred Julie Andrews and William Holden.
        Mr. Mulligan was also featured in ''The Undefeated'' (1969) with John Wayne and portrayed Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer in ''Little Big Man'' (1970).
        Among his other films were ''Love With the Proper Stranger'' (1964), ''The Group'' (1966), ''The Big Bus'' (1976) and ''Trail of the Pink Panther'' (1982).
        On Broadway in 1982, Mr. Mulligan starred with Suzanne Pleshette in ''Special Occasions,'' Bernard Slade's two-character play about a divorced couple who keep meeting over a period of time. He also starred on Broadway with Marlo Thomas in a 1974 Herb Gardner comedy, ''Thieves.''
        But he was best known for his roles on ABC's ''Soap'' from 1977 to 1981 and on NBC's ''Empty Nest'' from 1988 to 1995. On the former, he played Burt Campbell, a lovable screwball who was stepfather to the character played by Billy Crystal. And on ''Empty Nest,'' a spinoff of ''The Golden Girls,'' Mr. Mulligan played Dr. Harry Weston, a widower with three grown daughters.
        ''He's certainly different from my role on 'Soap,' '' Mr. Mulligan told The Associated Press in 1988. ''This guy's a good doctor who cares deeply about his patients. He's a good fellow trying to take care of his daughters. His wife died 18 months ago, and he still can't take the ring off.''
        Besides the 1980 Emmy for ''Soap'' and the 1989 Emmy for ''Empty Nest,'' each in the category of outstanding lead actor in a comedy, Mr. Mulligan won a 1989 Golden Globe for ''Empty Nest'' for best performance by an actor in a television series.
        He also appeared in episodes of ''The Twilight Zone,'' ''Charlie's Angels,'' ''The Partridge Family,'' ''Bonanza'' and ''Rat Patrol.''
        Mr. Mulligan, who was born in the Bronx on Nov. 13, 1932, planned on becoming a priest before he decided to study playwriting at Columbia University.
        According to Julian Myers, his longtime publicist and a friend, it was playwriting that led Mr. Mulligan into acting. Mr. Myers said that not long after Mr. Mulligan finished his studies, he drove to Florida to show one of his plays to the director of a playhouse.
        He arrived to find the director in the midst of rehearsals. And, Mr. Myers said, ''The director said, 'You'd better try out for this role.' ''
        Mr. Mulligan was married and divorced four times.
        He is survived by a son, James, of West Lebanon, N.H., and two brothers, James, of North Dakota, and Robert, of Connecticut, the director of films like ''Fear Strikes Out'' and ''To Kill a Mockingbird.''
        Correction:  October 2, 2000, Monday  An obituary of the actor Richard Mulligan on Thursday misstated the day of his death in some copies. It was Tuesday, not Wednesday.
