        Francis X. Larkin, who built a career in home furnishings and helped lead Fieldcrest Mills Inc., a maker of home-furnishing textiles based in Eden, N.C., died last Monday at Brick Memorial Hospital in Brick, N.J. He was 71.
        The cause was cancer, said the Frank Halpin's Funeral Home in Bloomfield, N.J.
        A native of New York City, Mr. Larkin lived in Montclair, N.J., for 40 years and helped run Fieldcrest from offices in New York until he retired in 1988.
        He graduated from Fordham University with a bachelor's degree in business administration and attended graduate school at New York University.
        After serving in the Marine Corps during World War II, Mr. Larkin joined Fieldcrest in 1956 and worked his way up through the ranks. He was president of Karastan Rug Mills, then a division of Fieldcrest, from 1975 until he became president and chief operating officer of Fieldcrest in 1981. He played a major role in the reorganization of the company, now Fieldcrest Cannon Inc., a unit of the Pillowtex Corporation, and retired in 1988 as vice chairman, president and chief operating officer.
        Mr. Larkin had been a trustee of the Institute of Textile Technology and a director of the American Textile Institute. He was also involved in and contributed to many projects to help the poor and the sick. He was a former board member of the American Life League and was a recipient of the distinguished community service award from Brandeis University.
        Mr. Larkin is survived by his wife, Patricia; a son, Francis X. Larkin Jr., of Boise, Idaho; three daughters, Mary Patricia Caputo of Bristol, Conn., Ann Therese Smith of Lawrenceville, N.J., and Elizabeth Ann Larkin of New York City; a brother, Edward Larkin of Nashua, N.H., and five granddaughters.
