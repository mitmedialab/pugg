Media General also entered the cable industry in 1983, with Fairfax Cable.
        Mr. Donnahoe became vice chairman of Media General in 1982. He retired in 1984, but served as a consultant and remained vice chairman through 1990.
        Mr. Donnahoe served in the Army Corps of Engineers during World War II. He joined Richmond Newspapers in 1950, and, after serving in the Pentagon during the Korean War, he returned to the company and was named vice president for marketing in 1955.
