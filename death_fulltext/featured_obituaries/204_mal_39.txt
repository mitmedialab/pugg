        Robert Jordan, a leading American bridge player, died Saturday at his home in West Palm Beach, Fla. He was 76.
        The cause was lung cancer, said his wife, Lorraine Jordan.
        On three occasions, Mr. Jordan came close to winning the world team title. In 1963, in St. Vincent, Italy, he represented North America in the Bermuda Bowl. The team led almost throughout the final against Italy, but was narrowly defeated, partly because the nonplaying captain made a strange decision to split two partnerships. A year later, in Manhattan, he lost again to Italy in the final of the World Team Olympiad. In the 1968 World Team Olympiad, in Deauville, France, he and his teammates lost once more to Italy, by a small margin. His partner on all three occasions was Arthur Robinson.
        Mr. Jordan's successes at the national level included the Vanderbilt Knockout Teams in 1961 and 1968, the Reisinger Board-a-Match teams in 1966 and 1967, the Master Mixed Teams in 1959 and the Open Pairs in 1960 and 1962. In 1960 he won the McKenney Trophy for the best American performance in a calendar year.
        Mr. Jordan was born in New York City but spent all his bridge-playing life in Philadelphia. He served briefly in the Army at the end of World War II and then became a businessman, dealing in cemetery lots. After retiring from tournament bridge he moved from Philadelphia to Cincinnati, and eventually to Florida.
        In addition to his third wife, Lorraine, he is survived by three children, Cynthia Posner of Orlando, Fla., Linda Jordan of Grand Junction, Colo., and Scott Jordan; two grandchildren; and one brother, George Jordan of Atlanta.
