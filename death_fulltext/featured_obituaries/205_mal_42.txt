        Charlie Fox, who was the 1971 manager of the year with the San Francisco Giants and spent a half-century in baseball as an executive, manager, coach and scout, died Monday at Stanford Hospital in Stanford, Calif. He was 82.
        The cause was complications from pneumonia, the Giants said.
        Fox, a Bronx native and a longtime member of the Giants organization, was managing the team's Phoenix club in the Pacific Coast League when he was named the San Francisco manager in May 1970, replacing Clyde King.
        He led the Giants to a 90-72 record and to the National League West title in 1971. Although the Giants lost to the Pittsburgh Pirates in the N.L. Championship Series, The Sporting News named Fox the major leagues' manager of the year and The Associated Press named him the National League's top manager.
        Fox managed the Giants until midway through the 1974 season, when he was replaced by Wes Westrum. He had an overall record of 348-327 with the Giants.
        Fox also spent brief periods as manager of the Expos and the Cubs. He was 12-22 for Montreal in 1976 and 17-22 for Chicago in 1983.
        He played briefly as a catcher for the New York Giants in 1942 before serving in the Navy during World War II. He was a coach with San Francisco from 1965 to 1968 and a Yankees coach in 1989.
        Fox was also general manager for Montreal from 1976 to 1978. He closed out his career by serving as a scout for the Houston Astros from 1990 to 1993.
        He is survived by his wife, Lola Bertolucci-Fox; two children, Michael and Barbara; three stepchildren, Mark, Dennis and Gary; and two grandchildren.
