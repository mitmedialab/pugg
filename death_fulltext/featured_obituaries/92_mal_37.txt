        Marshall L. Berkman, the chairman and chief executive of the Ampco-Pittsburgh Corporation, a manufacturing company that specializes in metals and hardware, died on Thursday in the USAir plane crash. He was 57 and lived in Pittsburgh.
        The Berkman family is the largest shareholder of Ampco-Pittsburgh, a publicly traded company with 950 employees. Mr. Berkman succeeded his father, Louis, as chairman and chief executive in 1979.
        Marshall Berkman was born in Steubenville, Ohio, in 1936 and graduated from Harvard College in 1958. He also attended Harvard Business School and Harvard Law School.
        In 1963, he went to work in Cincinnati for another company owned by his family, the Rust Craft Greeting Card company. In 1965 he moved to Rust Craft's headquarters in Dedham, Mass., and when that company was sold in 1979, he took over Ampco-Pittsburgh.
        Friends said Mr. Berkman was returning on USAir Flight 427 from a Chicago business trip with Ronald L. Cale, Ampco's tax manager.
        In addition to his father, who lives in Steubenville, Mr. Berkman is survived by his wife, Deborah; three daughters, Laura Berkman Coleman, of Pittsburgh, Ellen, of Washington, and Martha Berkman Winfield, of London; a sister, Donna Paul, of Pittsburgh, and one granddaughter.
