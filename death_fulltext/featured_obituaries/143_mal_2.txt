        Stanley Brandon Kearl, a sculptor, died on Nov. 21 at his home in Scarsdale, N.Y. He was 84.
        Mr. Kearl's small bronze figurative sculptures, which he described as ''metaphysical realism,'' drew on archaic and classical Greek art, European Surrealism and biblical references to create private scenarios that some critics compared to science fiction.
        Mr. Kearl had solo shows at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston (1957), the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers (1969) and the Guild Hall Museum in East Hampton, N.Y. (1982), as well as at museums and galleries in Basel, Munich, Rome, Stockholm and Bangkok, Thailand. His work, which is represented by the Arlene Bujese Gallery in East Hampton, was included in group exhibitions at the Whitney Museum of American Art (1962) and the Museum of Modern Art in New York (1965), and at the Venice Biennale in 1950.
        Mr. Kearl had a doctorate in sculpture from the University of Iowa and most recently taught sculpture at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. For nearly a decade, he lived in Rome as a Fulbright scholar.
        He is survived by his wife, Trudie; two stepsons, Richard C. Holbrooke, President Clinton's special envoy to the Balkans, and Andrew Holbrooke of Manhattan, and two sisters, Lucille Armati of Reston, Va., and Roberta Kearl of Connecticut.
