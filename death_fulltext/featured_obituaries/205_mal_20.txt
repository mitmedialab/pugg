        Jason Raize Rothenberg, an actor and singer who was one of the original stars of the Broadway musical ''The Lion King,'' died on Feb. 3 in Yass, Australia, southwest of Sydney. He was 28.
        The cause was suicide, said Chris Boneau, a spokesman for the Disney Company, producer of ''The Lion King.''
        Mr. Rothenberg, who used the stage name Jason Raize, had been out of contact with his family, and it was not known whether he was living in Australia or traveling there.
        He appeared as Pontius Pilate in the touring company of ''Jesus Christ Superstar'' before landing the role of Simba, the lion cub prince who flees his pride in disgrace but returns as an adult to avenge the death of his kingly father. He played the adult Simba for almost three years, beginning in 1997.
        Last year he provided the voice of Denahi, an Ice Age boy who does battle with a bear who turns out to be his younger brother, in the Disney animated film ''Brother Bear.''
        Mr. Rothenberg grew up in Oneonta, N.Y. He is survived by his father, Robert Rothenberg, and stepmother, Monet Rothenberg, both of Oneonta; his mother, Sarah MacArthur of Wrentham, Mass.; and a sister, Lisa Williams of Poughquag, N.Y.
