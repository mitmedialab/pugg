        The British screenwriter T. E. B. Clarke, whose screenplays included the Academy Award-winning script for ''The Lavender Hill Mob,'' died of cancer here on Saturday. He was 81 years old.
        Mr. Clarke's scripts played up British eccentricty and were made into films that were hugely popular around the world.
        In ''Passport to Pimlico'' (1949), the residents of London's Pimlico district discover they are part of France and declare themselves an independent state. ''The Lavender Hill Mob'' in 1951 had Alec Guinness as a bank clerk robbing the Bank of England of its gold bullion. ''The Titfield Thunderbolt'' in 1953 showed country dwellers fighting to preserve their railway line.
        Mr. Clarke said he went to the Bank of England for advice on how to rob it and filled out a form asking ''Nature of Business.'' He said the bank officials were very helpful and he used the method they showed him in his script.
        Mr. Clarke wrote the scripts for 14 films, including John Ford's only British film, ''Gideon's Day'' (1958). He co-wrote nine other films and was the author of 15 books, mostly novels. His autobiography, ''This Is Where I Came In,'' was published in 1974.
        Mr. Clarke worked in advertising and journalism and was in the London police force before turning to films.
        He is survived by a daughter.
