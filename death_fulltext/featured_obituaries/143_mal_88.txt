        Prof. Harmer E. Davis, the founding director of the California Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California at Berkeley,  died on Dec. 24 at his home in Walnut Creek, Calif. He was 93.
        Professor Davis spent 45 years on the Berkeley campus. He was born in Rochester, graduated from Berkeley in 1928, earned a master of science  degree in civil engineering in 1930 and was appointed an assistant professor in that discipline the same year.
        Shortly after World War II, the state Legislature decreed the creation of the institute at Berkeley to train engineers needed to upgrade California's roads and airports. Professor Davis was named as its director and led it until he retired in 1973.
        The program he developed combined research with teaching and left its mark on highway designs, traffic control, and airport layouts and lighting. His approach led other states to turn to academia for similar joint ventures.
        As director, he became involved in transportation issues around the country, especially in the areas of planning and financing highways and airports. His research focused on the engineering properties of concrete, asphalt and soils.
        Professor Davis is survived by his wife, Phyllis E., a daughter and two sons from an earlier marriage, Lynn Davis of San Diego, Eugene, of Union City, Calif., and Willard W., of Berkeley; a stepdaughter, Dr. Artha Shelley of Pretoria, South Africa; a stepson, Miguel Melbin of Calistoga, Calif.; three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
