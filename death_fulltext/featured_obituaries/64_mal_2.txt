        John Donovan, a novelist, playwright and past president of the Children's Book Council, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 63 years old.
        He died of cancer, said Paula Quint, the president of the council.
        Mr. Donovan was the author of the 1969 children's novel "I'll Get There. It Better Be Worth the Trip," which placed the subject of homosexuality into a children's book for the first time and opened the way for authors to discuss topics previously considered taboo in children's literature.
        Among his other books are "Wild in the World," "Good Old James" and "Family." His two short plays, "Damn You, Scarlett O'Hara" and "All My Pretty Little Ones," ran in 1963 under the collective title "Riverside Drive."
        Mr. Donovan was born in Lynn, Mass. He graduated from the College of William and Mary in 1949, received a law degree from the University of Virginia in 1957, and worked as a lawyer for the Copyright Office of the Library of Congress before joining St. Martin's Press, the publishing concern. He became the executive director of the Children's Book Council in 1967.
