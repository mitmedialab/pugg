        Alton E. Peters, a Manhattan lawyer and philanthropist who was a passionate champion of opera, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 64 and also had homes in Falls Village, Conn., and on Mount Desert Island in Maine.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, said his wife, Elizabeth.
        Mr. Peters was a partner in the Manhattan law firm of Kelley Drye & Warren, which he joined in 1983.
        From 1986 until his death, he was the president of the Metropolitan Opera Guild, on whose board he had served since 1965. The Guild provides educational programs for the Met, publishes the magazine Opera News, and runs the gift shop and other marketing projects, and Mr. Peters expanded all those activities. He was also a member of the Metropolitan Opera Association's executive committee. Mrs. Peters said that opera had become his great love when he listened to the Met radio broadcasts as a student.
        But he was active in a wide range of other causes. He was the chairman of Goodwill Industries of Greater New York, and was on the boards of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, the Academy of American Poets, the Animal Medical Center and many other organizations. He also staunchly supported the English-Speaking Union and other groups that fostered relations between England and the United States, and in 1982 was made an officer in the Order of the British Empire.
        Mr. Peters was born in Albany, where his father, Emil, served as a general counsel to General Electric. His maternal grandfather, Joseph Rosch, was a justice of the New York State Supreme Court.
        Mr. Peters was a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School.
        In addition to his wife, who is the youngest daughter of Irving Berlin, he is survived by a daughter, Rachel Peters of New York; a stepdaughter, Emily Fletcher of London, and two granddaughters.
