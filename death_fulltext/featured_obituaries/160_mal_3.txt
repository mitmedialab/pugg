        Phillip W. Katz, the inventor of file-compression software used in computers around the world, died on April 14 in a hotel room in Milwaukee. He was 37.
        The cause was complications from alcoholism, according to a report from the Milwaukee medical examiner's office.
        Mr. Katz's program, PKZip, played a major role in making Internet communications faster and less expensive. The zip file archive he developed compresses information so that it takes up less space on a disk drive and less time is needed to download it from the Web or send it to another computer.
        In an interview with The Milwaukee Journal in 1993, Mr. Katz said he had developed the concept for PKZip at his mother's kitchen table in 1986. ''It was just a hobby,'' he said. ''I didn't expect it to turn into a business.'' Mr. Katz is survived by his mother, Hildegard, and his sister, Cynthia.
        Mr. Katz built a company called PKWare Inc. on the success of the file-compression program and became its president. Today, files compressed with Mr. Katz's software are ubiquitous and the term ''zip file'' is familiar to even casual computer users.
