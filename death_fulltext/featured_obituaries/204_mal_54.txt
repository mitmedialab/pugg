        Max D. Barnes, who wrote many of country music's most evocative hits during the last 30 years, including ''Chiseled in Stone,'' about the death of his son, died here on Jan. 11. He was 67.
        The cause was complications of pneumonia, family members told The Nashville Tennessean.
        He won the Country Music Association's Song of the Year prize twice, in 1989 for Vern Gosdin's recording of ''Chiseled in Stone,'' written with Mr. Gosdin; and in 1992 for Vince Gill's recording of ''Look at Us,'' written with Mr. Gill.
        Mr. Barnes was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Association's International Hall of Fame in 1992.
        His other Billboard Top 10 country hits included Conway Twitty's ''Don't Take It Away,'' the Kendalls' ''Thank God for the Radio'' and George Jones's classic ''Who's Gonna Fill Their Shoes.''
        Max Duane Barnes was born into a large musical family in Iowa. At 16 he dropped out of school and started singing in local honky-tonks. He formed a band called the Golden Rockets, and its lead singer, Patsy, became his wife. Mr. Barnes tried his hand as a carpenter and trucker before moving to Nashville in 1973 to pursue music. Two years later his elder son, Patrick, was killed in an automobile accident. ''Chiseled in Stone'' refers to the finality of the words carved on Patrick's tombstone.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Barnes is survived by his son Max T. Barnes, also a songwriter, and his daughter, Genevieve Kephart.
