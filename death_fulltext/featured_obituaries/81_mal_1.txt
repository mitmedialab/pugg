        David E. Halvorsen, former editor of The San Francisco Examiner, died on Wednesday at his home in San Francisco six months after diagnosis of an incurable brain tumor. He was 60.
        As city editor at The Chicago Tribune, Mr. Halvorsen formed an investigative news team that won two Pulitzer Prizes.
        He was appointed managing editor of The Examiner in 1976 and was its editor from 1982 to 1985. From 1985 until his retirement in 1989, Mr. Halvorsen was editor in chief of the Alameda Newspaper Group, which publishes five dailies in the East Bay area.
        He is survived by his wife, Kum Ja; two daughters, Laura and Andrea; a son, David Jr.; his mother, Lillian Ervay, and a sister, Harriet Cramer, both of Nora Springs, Iowa, and three grandchildren. A second daughter, Jeanne Martin-Vegue, died the day before Mr. Halvorsen's death after a long illness.
