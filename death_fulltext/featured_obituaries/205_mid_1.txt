        Esther Buhler Bradley, a screenwriter and the widow of General of the Army Omar N. Bradley, died on Feb. 3 in Rancho Mirage, Calif. She was 81.
        The cause was pneumonia, said Col. Charles Honeycutt, a former aide to the general.
        Mrs. Bradley, known as Kitty Buhler, wrote episodes for television, including ''My Three Sons'' and ''The 20th Century Fox Hour.'' Film credits included ''China Doll.''
        She met General Bradley while she was writing an article about his life. They married when he was chairman of the Bulova Watch Company in 1966, the year after the death of his first wife, Mary Quayle Bradley.
        Esther Bradley, who was married three times, was born Esther Dora Biolo in New York City and attended Manhattan Business College, Kansas Wesleyan University and U.C.L.A.
        General Bradley died in 1981 at the age of 88. Mrs. Bradley is survived by a sister, Lee Rosenthal of New York and Florida.
