        Lawrence Bogorad, a leading researcher in plant biology who was widely known for his work on the synthesis of chlorophyll and on inheritance patterns in a variety of plants, died on Dec. 28 while vacationing with his family in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. He was 82.
        The cause was a stroke, said his daughter, Kiki Bogorad-Gross.
        Dr. Bogorad taught biology at Harvard University for more than two decades. Since the 1970's, his research on plant genetics has helped guide younger scientists in the field.
        ''He was the towering figure in work that led to the understanding of the distribution and location of plant genes, and what the genes code for,'' said Dr. Woody Hastings, a Harvard biology professor and a longtime colleague of Dr. Bogorad's.
        Dr. Bogorad, who retired from Harvard in 1991, served as president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Society of Plant Physiologists. He also served on various committees of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Science Foundation and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
        Lawrence Bogorad was born in Tashkent in what is now Uzbekistan. He grew up in Chicago and received his bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago.
        After serving in the military, he obtained a doctorate in botany from the University of Chicago and later joined the faculty. In 1967, he left for a position at Harvard.
        In addition to his daughter, Kiki, of Newton, Mass., Dr. Bogorad is survived by his wife of 60 years, Rosalyn, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease; a son, Leonard, of Bethesda, Md.; four grandchildren; and his partner, Kathleen Mullinix.
