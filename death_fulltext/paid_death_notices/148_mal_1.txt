        deVRIES-Lion. Hofstra University is profoundly saddened by the death on April 29th, 1999 of honorary alumnus and loyal friend Lion deVries. Mr. deVries and his wife, Tilly, helped to build strong ties between The Netherlands and Hofstra's academic community. Through the assistance of Mr. and Mrs. deVries, Hofstra University and the Dutch have formed a strong, supportive relationship that has benefitted both students and faculty. Mr. deVries helped with the creation of Hofstra's annual Dutch Festival, now in its 16th year. The Dutch Festival has brought hundreds of thousands of visitors to the University's campus and become a much anticipated tradition on Long Island. He also helped to establish a Dutch Studies Institute at Hofstra. Through this program, Hofstra students and faculty travel to the Roosevelt Study Center in Middleburg in The Netherlands every summer. Mr. deVries had been instrumental in arranging loans of Dutch art to the Hofstra Museum and in creating a hybrid tulip named for the University. He also played a major role in planning the historic visit of HRH Princess Margriet and her husband, Mr. Pieter van Vollenhoven, to the Hofstra campus in 1991. Lion and Tilly deVries have been honored for their outstanding efforts in promoting good relations between The Netherlands and the United States. Queen Beatrix of The Netherlands bestowed upon them the prestigious award of Knighthood in the Order of Orange Nassau, one of the highest forms of recognition given by the Dutch government. In addition to his tireless efforts at Hofstra, Mr. deVries was an active member of the Corporate Development Committee, The Netherlands America Foundation and The Netherlands Club. Lion deVries is survived by his wife, Tilly; daughters, Cristina and Eveline; and grandchildren, Bridge and Michael. James M. Shuart President Helene Fortunoff Chairperson, Board of Trustees
