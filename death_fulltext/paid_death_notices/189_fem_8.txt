        ULLMANN-Hanni. We are deeply saddened by the passing at the age of 94 of Hanni Ullmann, the Founding President of Neve Hanna in Kiryat Gat, Israel. Hanni was a gracious, dynamic and selfless lady. In 1933 Hanni was one of the leaders of the Ahava Home for Children and Youth at Kiryat Bialik that saved countless youngsters from the Holocaust. In 1974 she established a home for troubled children from dysfunctional families at Kiryat Gat that in time became an exemplary institution for all of Israel. Hanni was honored by the Prime Minister of Israel in 1991 for her outstanding leadership in the protection of children. We extend our deepest sympathies to her family in Israel and in the States. She has left us a glorious heritage that we hope to perpetuate. The Steering Committee American Friends of Neve Hanna Rabbi Benjamin Z.
