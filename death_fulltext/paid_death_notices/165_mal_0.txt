        DEITRICK-John E., Sr., M.D. The Boards, Faculty and Staff of Weill Medical College and Graduate School of Medical Sciences of Cornell University and New YorkPresbyterian Hospital are deeply saddened by the passing of our esteemed colleague and friend, Dr. John E. Deitrick, Sr., who served as Dean of Cornell University Medical College from 1957-1969. During his long and distinguished career, Dr. Deitrick was one of the leading figures in American medical education. He joined The New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in 1934 as a resident in medicine and subsequently became a member of the Medical College faculty in the Department of Medicine. In 1949, he took a leave of absence from the Medical Center to direct a comprehensive survey of medical education for the Association of American Medical Colleges and the American Medical Association, which published his landmark report: ''Medical Schools in the United States at the Mid-Century.'' In 1957, Dr. Deitrick returned to New York-Cornell to become Dean of the Medical College. Among his many accomplishments was a significant increase in the ration of faculty to students, with the number of faculty increasing by 43% during his deanship. From 1962 to 1969, he served as a Trustee of Cornell University, representing the faculty of the Medical College. In 1969, when he retired from the Deanship, he became Professor Emeritus of Medicine. In 1982, Dr. Deitrick received New York-Cornell's highest honor, the Maurice R. Greenberg Distinguished Service Award, in recognition of his exceptional and longstanding service. We extend our deepest condolences to Dr. Dietrick's children, Sara, John, and William, and their children.
