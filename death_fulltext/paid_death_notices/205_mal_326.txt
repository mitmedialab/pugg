        BENENSON--Charles B. Devoted and beloved husband of Jane. Devoted and beloved father of Bruce William, Frederick and Lawrence. Cherished brother of Lawrence and Raymond. Passed away suddenly on February 22 in Palm Beach, FL. He lived to be 91 years old and remained active in his many pursuits to the very end. In addition to his sons and his brothers, he will be greatly missed by his four grandchildren, dedicated office staff, nieces, nephews, cousins and business associates, all of whom benefited from his wonderful qualities and dedication. His business career, spanning a remarkable 70 years, and his passion for the arts brought him in close intimate contact with all aspects of New York City life. His contributions to the arts, education for inner-city children and Jewish philanthropic causes were known to all, as was his personal commitment to Yale University. He was a founding member of the Association for a Better New York, the Realty Foundation, the Lincoln Center Real Estate and Construction Council, the New York Junior Tennis League, the I Have a Dream Program, and the Museum of African Art and numerous other charitable organizations. Widely respected for his wisdom and integrity in the real estate industry, his humor, optimism and vitality enriched the lives of all who came to know him. His sophistication and intellect were an inspiration to all who knew him. His devotion and love were of inestimable value to those closest to him; their loss is irreplaceable.
