        Paul Gitlin, a lawyer and literary agent who brokered multimillion-dollar deals for authors in the early 1970's, died on Wednesday. He was 83.
        Mr. Gitlin came to prominence by negotiating innovative deals in the 1960's and early 1970's, when literary auctions were a relatively new phenomenon and authors' lawyers and agents were becoming stars in their own right.
        Gruff and charming, Mr. Gitlin was credited by one client, the novelist Irving Wallace, with winning the author a $2.3 million, four-book contract in 1972. But his role in reshaping the economics of the book industry began at least as early as 1960, when he designed the first combined hardcover-paperback deal by selling Pocket Books ''The Carpetbaggers,'' by Harold Robbins.
        In addition to Mr. Wallace and Mr. Robbins, Mr. Gitlin's clients included Bill Bradley, Sidney Sheldon, Barbara Taylor Bradford, Cornelius Ryan and William Saroyan. He also represented the estates of such prominent American authors as Thomas Wolfe, Upton Sinclair, Sinclair Lewis, Ayn Rand and Raymond Chandler.
        Born June 17, 1915, in Brooklyn, Mr. Gitlin was a specialist in copyright law. In 1938, in his last year at Harvard Law School, he was the first winner of the ASCAP Nathan Burkan Memorial award for his essay on how copyright law should apply to radio broadcasts. He was a past president of the Copyright Society of the U.S.A. and a partner in the publishing law firm of Ernst, Cane, Berner & Gitlin, which represented, among other clients, the novelist Mario Puzo. He also helped found the Walter Derenberg Copyright Library at the New York University Law School.
        He is survived by his son, Jonathan, of Manhattan, and a sister, Claire Gnessin, of Syosset, N.Y.
