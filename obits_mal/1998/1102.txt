        Walter George Berl, a chemist whose research included high-energy ram-jet fuels and international firefighting programs, died on Oct. 24 while vacationing in Durango, Colo. He was 81 and lived in Bethesda, Md.
        The cause was heart failure, said a spokesman for Johns Hopkins University. Dr. Berl retired in 1994 from the university's Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md.
        Dr. Berl, who edited a number of technical publications in his field, was born in Vienna. He earned a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from the Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1937, a master's degree in chemistry at Harvard University in 1939 and a doctorate in physical chemistry from what is now Carnegie Mellon University in 1941.
        Dr. Berl conducted research and taught at Carnegie Mellon until 1945, when he joined the staff of the Applied Physics Laboratory. In 1956 he was appointed to the principal professional staff, the institution's highest staff designation.
        He oversaw a program examining how fire starts and progresses, and studied energy-related combustion phenomena. His expertise helped to plan strategy for extinguishing oil well fires in Kuwait after the Persian Gulf War.
        Dr. Berl was the author of numerous articles, a consultant to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and editor-in-chief of the Johns Hopkins Applied Technology Digest. He held patents for a catalytic igniter for ram-jets and a method for bonding oxidizer particles in the manufacture of explosives.
        Dr. Berl is survived by his wife, Shirley Anne Hargraves; a daughter, Kathleen Victorino of Bethesda; a brother, Herbert of Washington; a stepdaughter, Cynthia Tobin of Blue Hill, Me., and a stepson, Richard Hargraves of Durango, Colo. His earlier marriage to Ruth Gilman ended in divorce.
