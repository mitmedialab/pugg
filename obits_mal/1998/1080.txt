        Dr. Robert Silber, a hematologist and educator, died on Nov. 3 at his home in Durham, N.C. He was 67.
        The cause was heart disease, his family said.
        At his death Dr. Silber had been a clinical professor of medicine at Duke University Medical Center in Durham for six years. He was director of New York University School of Medicine's hematology division from 1968 to 1992.
        His scientific research focused chiefly on leukemia and on the treatment of hematologic malignancies. In 1989 he was one of a group of scientists who reported in the journal Science that a drug derived from a Chinese tree had proved to be a potent agent against colon cancer in experiments on animals.
        Born in Vienna, he went with his family to the Dominican Republic in 1939 to escape Nazism. The family came to the United States in 1945, and he received a bachelor's degree in 1950 from New York University and a medical degree in 1954 from State University of New York, Downstate Medical Center, in Brooklyn.
        He joined the New York University medical school faculty in 1962. The honors he received included a Guggenheim Fellowship.
        His 1954 marriage to Barbara Carol Antell ended in divorce.
        Surviving are his wife, Barbara Kamhi Silber; two daughters, Dr. Andrea Dickey of Guilford, Conn., and Laura Silber of Manhattan; two sons, Jeffrey of Ithaca, N.Y., and Michael of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.
