        Peter Paul Artaserse, a retired Jersey City lawyer, Superior Court judge and former state legislator, died Sunday at General Hospital Center in Passaic. He was 98 and lived in Clifton, N.J.
        He had suffered a brief illness, his family said.
        Judge Artaserse was the son of Italian immigrants and had eight siblings. He was born in Manhattan and grew up in Jersey City, where he lived most of his life. He never attended college, but took night classes to earn his academic high school certificate and the degree from New Jersey Law School with which he went into private practice.
        He soon became active in the Hudson County Democratic Party and in 1934 was elected to the Assembly. He held elective office for 17 years, rising to Democratic minority leader and dean of the House.
        Gov. Alfred E. Driscoll, a Republican, appointed him to Superior Court in 1954, and he worked as a judge for 17 years in Hudson County and on the Appellate Division. He stepped down as assignment, or administrative, judge for the county in 1971 after reaching the mandatory retirement age.
        Judge Artaserse was then affiliated with what is now the Jersey City firm of Schumann, Hanlon, Doherty, McCrossin & Paolino. He retired from practice in 1989 at age 89.
        A former president of the Hudson County bar, he was also active in Italian-American organizations in Jersey City. Among other things, he was a past president of the Jersey City chapter of the Dante Alighieri Society, a national organization for people interested in the work of the author of ''The Divine Comedy.''
        His wife of 53 years, Muriel Dodd Artaserse, died in 1997. He is survived by their son, Peter, also of Clifton.
