        Glenn William Poorman, the president of Esso International from 1966 until he retired in 1970, died Wednesday at his home in Crowley, La. He was 90 years old.
        Mr. Poorman, who was born in Palmyra, Pa., fell ill with scarlet fever when he was 12 years old, which affected his eyesight and forced him to drop out of school.
        He recovered his health by working on a huckster wagon where he sold fruit and vegetables.
        He attended Dartmouth College, where he majored in chemistry and graduated cum laude in 1930.
        Finding it hard to get a job in the Depression, he continued his studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he got a master's degree in chemical engineering.
        He got a job in 1932 with the Standard Oil Company at its huge refinery in Baton Rouge. Not having the money for a train ticket, he caught a ride on an oil tanker to the refinery.
        In 1934 he married Louise Gueno from Crowley, who was attending Louisiana State University.
        After 10 years of working at the refinery he was transferred to the company's headquarters in New York where he helped to plan the transition from war to peacetime when demand for gasoline and other products began to surge.
        He helped to set up the first system to measure management performance at the company.
        In 1959 he was named the vice president of Esso Export, a Standard Oil affiliate, and in 1966 was named the president of Esso International, the worldwide marketing and transportation affiliate.
        Standard Oil is now known as the Exxon Corporation.
        He is survived by his wife, Louise; two daughters, Louise Baenninger of Mandeville, La., and Sanna Randolph Thomas of Mill Valley, Calif., and three grandchildren.
