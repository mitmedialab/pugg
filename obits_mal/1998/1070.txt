        John Francis Daly, an ear, nose and throat specialist who contributed to the development of modern head and neck surgery while associated with New York University Medical School and many other regional institutions, died last Wednesday at Holy Name Hospital in Teaneck, N.J. A former resident of Tenafly, he was 86 and lived in Fort Lee.
        Dr. Daly began in head and neck surgery early, when it branched off as a separate medical specialty. He wrote extensively on the subject and as a teacher and practicing surgeon helped develop new techniques for use in the operating room.
        He was director of otolaryngology, which deals with disorders of the ear, nose and throat, at both Bellevue Hospital Center and N.Y.U. Medical Center from the late 1940's to 1980. At the university, he was a professor and chairman of the Department of Otolaryngology from 1949 until his retirement in 1980.
        Dr. Daly was born in Jersey City, and graduated from Fordham University in 1933. He received his medical degree from what is now Downstate Medical Center of the State University of New York. He completed his training at the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital and Harvard University and served in the Army Air Force in World War II.
        He was a former president of the American Society for Head and Neck Surgery, the American Laryngological Association and the American Academy of Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology, and chairman of the American Medical Association's section on otolaryngology.
        Dr. Daly is survived by his wife of 57 years, Annette O'Mealia Daly; a daughter, Sharon Ann Butler of Hillsdale, N.J., three grandsons and a great-granddaughter.
