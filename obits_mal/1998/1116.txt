        Elvis J. Stahr Jr., an educator and environmentalist who was a Secretary of the Army in the Kennedy Administration and was later president of the National Audubon Society, died on Wednesday at his home in Greenwich, Conn. He was 82.
        Mr. Stahr's career spanned top jobs in the military, in higher education and in the environmental movement. Mr. Stahr was named dean of the University of Kentucky law school in 1956, became president of West Virginia University in 1958 and was appointed president of Indiana University in 1962.
        Between academic jobs, he was Army Secretary, from 1961 through 1962. That period included the Berlin crisis, the Bay of Pigs debacle and the Federal deployment of the Alabama National Guard to integrate the state university.
        Born in Hickman, Ky., in 1916, Mr. Stahr graduated from the University of Kentucky in 1936 and in 1939, received a B.A. in law from Oxford University as a Rhodes scholar.
        In 1968 Mr. Stahr assumed the presidency of the National Audubon Society, where he led efforts to preserve the Everglades from commercial and industrial development. He also worked to prevent environmental harm from dam and water projects and to obtain accords on international whaling. Under his direction, the Audubon Society's membership increased nearly fourfold.
        After retiring from the society in 1981, he worked in his private law practice in Connecticut.
        Mr. Stahr is survived by his wife, Dorothy; two sons, Stuart, of Wappingers Falls, N.Y., and Bradford, of Greenwich; a daughter, Stephanie Stahr of Vienna, Va., and two grandchildren.
