        Michael Todd, publisher of Grapezine, a magazine about winegrowing, died on Saturday at Winthrop University Hospital in Mineola, N.Y. He was 51 and had homes in midtown Manhattan and Sag Harbor on Long Island.
        The cause was complications from lymphoma, said his wife, Claudia Payne.
        Mr. Todd founded Grapezine five years ago. It focused at first on Long Island winegrowing and went on to report about other winegrowing regions. Earlier, he was an art director for Psychology Today, Wine Spectator and other magazines. He also was a freelance art director for The New York Times and operated an advertising-design company for a time.
        He was born in Sevenoaks in the county of Kent in Britain, was educated in Britain, worked for an advertising agency in London and moved to the United States in 1969.
        His marriage to Mary Peacock ended in divorce. Besides Ms. Payne, a senior editor at The New York Times, he is survived by his father, Clifford, of Tunbridge Wells in Kent.
