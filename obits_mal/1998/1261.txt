        Edwin Evariste Moise, Distinguished Professor of Mathematics emeritus at Queens College and an author of textbooks, who helped decipher German and Japanese military signals in World War II, died Friday at St. Vincent's Hospital. He was 79 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was complications following heart surgery, his family said.
        Dr. Moise (pronounced mo-EEZ) specialized in topology, the mathematical study of those properties of geometric figures that remain unchanged under distortion, as with a Mobius strip.
        He was the author of ''Introductory Problem Courses in Analysis and Topology'' (Springer, 1982). He also wrote ''Elementary Geometry from an Advanced Standpoint'' (Addison Wesley; 3d ed., 1990), ''Number Systems of Elementary Math'' (Addison Wesley, 1966), ''Calculus, Part I'' (Addison Wesley, 1966) and other textbooks.
        Dr. Moise served on the faculty of  Queens College from 1971 until 1987, then devoted his time to studying 19th century English poetry.
        Born in New Orleans, Dr. Moise  graduated from Tulane University in 1940 and received his Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Texas in 1947. During World War II, as a cryptanalyst in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, he decoded enemy communications.
        From 1947 to 1960, Dr. Moise taught at the University of Michigan, eventually becoming a professor. He was a professor of mathematics at Harvard University before arriving at Queens College.
        He was a temporary member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., (1949-51), and was also president of the Mathematical Association of America and vice president of the American Mathematical Society, as well as a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
        Dr. Moise is survived by Mary Leake Moise, whom he married in 1942; a daughter, Claire Moise of Manhattan; a son, Edwin, of Clemson, S.C.; and a grandson.
