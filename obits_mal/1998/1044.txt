        Dr. Edward Watson Hook Jr., a national authority on infectious diseases like salmonella and influenza, died on Oct. 5 at a hotel in Gettysburg, Pa., where he had gone for a meeting. He was 74 and lived in Charlottesville, Va.
        The cause was a coronary thrombosis, according to the University of Virginia, where Dr. Hook formally retired this year as Mulholland Professor of Medicine at the Health Sciences Center. He was chairman of department of internal medicine at Virginia for 21 years, until 1990.
        During his tenure he established the humanities in medicine program, offering classes to awaken medical students to the personal, human aspects of medicine. He frequently contributed to professional journals and trained hundreds of specialists in internal medicine.
        Dr. Hook, who was born in Sumter, S.C., graduated from Wofford College in 1946 and received his medical degree at Emory University three years later. Before joining the faculty in Charlottesville in 1969 as a professor and department chairman, he was associated with Cornell University Medical College and New York Hospital.
        He was a past president of national medical organizations, including the American College of Physicians, was elected to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences and served on the American Board of Internal Medicine. He was a former board chairman of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Clinical Scholars Program.
        Dr. Hook is survived by his wife of 49 years, Jessie Thurecht Hook; two sons, Dr. Edward W. 3d, of Birmingham, Ala., and Robert R., of Crystal River, Fla.; two daughters, Susan Norton, of London, and Jane Brosig, of Sausalito, Calif.; and four grandchildren.
