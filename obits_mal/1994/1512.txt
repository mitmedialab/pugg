        John Fearnley, a stage manager and director closely identified with the work of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein 2d, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan.  He was 80.
        The cause was cancer, said his niece, Daphne Mumford.
        After a decade as casting director for Rodgers and Hammerstein, Mr. Fearnley moved into directing, staging more than 20 musicals for the New York City Light Opera at City Center, including revivals of Rodgers and Hammerstein's "Oklahoma!," "South Pacific," "The King and I," "Carousel" and "The Sound of Music," as well as "Kiss Me Kate" and "Brigadoon." He also directed 10 productions at the Jones Beach Theater, including "Carousel," "The Sound of Music," "Oklahoma!" and "Fiddler on the Roof."
        Mr. Fearnley was born in Westport, Conn. He studied at the Royal Academy for the Dramatic Arts in London, and began his career as an actor and stage manager.
        In addition to his niece, he is survived by his sister, Celine Knudsen of Oslo, and two nephews.
