        He transferred to the research laboratories in Rahway, N.J., in 1979 as senior director, clinical research international. In 1982, he was named to the executive medical director post.
        He is survived by his wife of 39 years, Peggy Hodgson Roylance; two daughters, Kate Mahadeva of Sanderstead, England, and Wendy Baugh of London; a brother, Dr. John Roylance of Bristol; a sister, Jose Stokes of Clevedon, England, and two granddaughters.
