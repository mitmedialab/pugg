        Edward Rivera, the author of the autobiographical novel ''Family Installments: Memoirs of Growing Up Hispanic'' and an assistant professor at City College of New York, died on Aug. 25 in Manhattan, where he lived. He was 62.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his brother Richard.
        When ''Family Installments'' was published in 1982, it drew attention as a groundbreaking book dealing with Latino life in Puerto Rico and New York City. In a review in The New York Times Book Review, Philip Lopate said that the novel was ''noisily brimming with life,'' and praised it for its ''graceful, lyrical language.'' Richard Rivera said that his brother's book took 10 years to write and that it was ''a way of documenting the importance of our family in his life, and the pain of culturation.''
        Although this was his only book, he also wrote short stories and essays, which were published in literary magazines and later anthologized. In a sardonic essay in The Massachusetts Review in 1996 he recalled the difficulty he had in finding a publisher for his novel because it did not fit preconceived notions of what he called ''Underclass Lit.''
        Mr. Rivera was born in Puerto Rico, grew up in New York and earned degrees from City College and Columbia University. He taught in the English department at City College and at the college's Center for Worker Education since 1969. He was known as a mentor to younger writers, including Abraham Rodriguez Jr. and Junot Diaz.
        In addition to his brother Richard, of Brooklyn, he is survived by his sisters, Aurea Crawford of Maitland, Fla., and Carmen Liberante of Ridgefield, Conn., and a brother Hector, of Plainfield, Conn.
