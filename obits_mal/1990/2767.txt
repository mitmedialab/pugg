        Solomon S. Dobin, founder of Bargain Town U.S.A., an early discount chain, died on Thursday at his home in East Rockaway, L.I. He was 79 years old.
        Mr. Dobin died of respiratory failure after an asthma attack, said his son, Stephen.
        Mr. Dobin founded the chain in Brooklyn in 1960 and later opened other stores in New York, Connecticut and Puerto Rico. The stores were later sold, and he retired in 1975.
        Besides his son, who lives in Woodmere, L.I., Mr. Dobin is survived by his wife, the former Henrietta Horne; a daughter, Myra Markowitz of Hewlett, L.I.; a brother, Abraham, and two sisters, Esther Yormack and Rose Rivkin, all of Miami Beach, and four grandchildren.
