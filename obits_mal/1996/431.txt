        Craig M. Crenshaw, a retired physicist and chief scientist of the Army Materiel Command for 12 years, died of a heart attack on March 22 at his home in McLean, Va. He was 79.
        Dr. Crenshaw was a civilian scientist in the Army for more than 30 years, beginning in 1942, and served as chief scientist for the Army Materiel Command from 1962 until his retirement in 1974. He specialized in acoustic detection and ranging and worked as a troubleshooter on several atomic projects, his family said.
        The son of missionary parents, Dr. Crenshaw was born in China and returned there in later years to promote cooperation with China in the college teaching of physics. He earned his doctorate in physics at New York University in 1942.
        He is survived by three sons, Craig M. Crenshaw Jr., of Arlington, Va., David S. Crenshaw of McLean, and William C. Crenshaw of Vienna, Va.; a daughter, Beth  Farrell of Mountain View, Calif.; a brother, John S., of Shreveport, La.; a sister, Anna C. Lopez of Potomac, Md., and eight grandchildren.
