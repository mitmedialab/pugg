        John D'Amico, a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame who worked as a National Hockey League linesman for 23 years, died Sunday in Toronto. He was 67.
        The cause was leukemia and bone cancer, the league said.
        D'Amico served as an N.H.L. official from 1964 to 1987, working numerous Stanley Cup finals, and he was an official in four Canada Cup tournaments. After leaving on-ice work, he was a supervisor of officials for the league.
        ''Everyone knew if it was an important game, John would be one of the two linesmen,'' Ray Scapinello, a longtime fellow linesman, was quoted by the N.H.L. as saying. ''If it was the deciding game of a Stanley Cup series, it was John's. The seventh game of the finals? Automatic.''
        Paul Stewart, a former referee and player, said: ''John was as strong as an ox. Once D'Amico pulled two guys apart, they were done.''
        D'Amico was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1993.
        He is survived by his wife, Dorothy, and four children, Jeff, Anthony, Angelo and Tina.
