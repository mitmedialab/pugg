        Barry Movsessian Canterna, a sculptor whose work has been shown at galleries in New York, San Francisco, Pittsburgh and Belgium, died on Wednesday at Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 41 years old.
        Betty Lee Hunt, a friend, said he died of complications from AIDS.
        Mr. Canterna was best known for an early work, "Police Brutality," which he undertook in 1978 after he and his younger brother, Kevin, became involved in a street conflict with police officers.
        The life-size sculpture shows eight police officers hovering over two handcuffed figures who represent the brothers. It was the focus of attention when 18 of his artworks, most of them in bronze, went on display at a Manhattan gallery in 1979.
        Mr. Canterna was born in Sharon, Pa. He attended the Carnegie Mellon Institute and then received a scholarship to Long Island University. He also attended Pratt Institute.
        He established the Modern Art Foundry in Astoria and worked there until his illness. In recent years, he devoted his time to helping people with AIDS.
        He is survived by his mother and father, Rosemary and William Canterna of Queens; his brother, Kevin, of Los Angeles, and his companion, David Barrett of New York City.
