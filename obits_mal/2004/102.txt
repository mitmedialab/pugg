        Richard Edward Diamond, publisher of The Staten Island Advance, part of the Newhouse publishing empire, died yesterday at his home in the Todt Hill section of Staten Island. A lifelong resident of Staten Island, he was 71.
        The cause was prostate cancer, a family spokesman said.
        The Staten Island Advance, founded in 1886, was the first newspaper in what became Advance Publications, parent company of the Newhouse chain of daily newspapers. It is one of about two dozen dailies published by the privately held company, along with an array of other publications, including magazines from Condé Nast and Fairchild Publications.
        Mr. Diamond, a grandson of Meyer R. Newhouse, the father of S. I. Newhouse Sr., joined the staff of The Staten Island Advance in 1953. He was named associate publisher in 1956 and formally assumed the title of publisher upon the death of S. I. Newhouse, his uncle, in 1979.
        Mr. Diamond graduated from Staten Island Academy and, in 1953, from Cornell University. He was a member of the boards of the academy and of Staten Island University Hospital. He was also on the boards of the Newspaper Advertising Bureau and, from 1992-97, of the Newspaper Association of America.
        Mr. Diamond is survived by his wife of 40 years, Alice Blach Diamond; two daughters, Caroline D. Harrison of Todt Hill, who is general manager of The Advance, and Alison D. Levasseur of Manhattan; a son, Richard Jr. of Princeton, N.J., assistant to the publisher of The Times of Trenton, an Advance Publications newspaper; a sister, Elaine Berman of Pawcatuck, Conn.; and four grandchildren.
