        Jaime de Piniés, who was a member of Spain's delegation to the United Nations for 29 years and who presided over the 40th General Assembly in 1985, died on Dec. 29 in Madrid, his son Jaime Jr. said. He was 86.
        Mr. de Piniés was a member of the Spanish delegation in 1956 and became its leader 12 years later.
        He remained involved with the United Nations until his death. He was also Spain's ambassador to Britain, the Philippines, Cuba and the United States.
        In 1960, Mr. de Piniés publicly challenged the Soviet leader, Nikita S. Khrushchev, during an Assembly session. Khrushchev, who had finished giving a speech, noticed that the Spanish delegation was not applauding. Upset, he began scolding the Spaniards in Russian. Mr. de Piniés responded in Spanish, and when Khruschev waved a finger in his challenger's face, the gesture was defiantly returned. The two men shook hands the next day, and business resumed as usual.
        Mr. de Piniés spent about four months in New York each year. He and his first wife, Luz Bianchi, who died in 1983, were a prominent part of the city's diplomatic and social circles.
        He was divorced from his second wife, Julia.
        He is survived by his sons, Jaime Jr., of Madrid, and Pablo, of New York; his brother, Felix, of Spring Lake, N.J.; and three grandchildren.
