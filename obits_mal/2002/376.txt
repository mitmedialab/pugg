        Bob Akin, who twice won the 12 Hours of Sebring, America's oldest automobile endurance race, died on Monday of injuries sustained during a test run last Friday. Akin, of Pocantico Hills, N.Y., was 66.
        He was testing a 1988 Nissan GTP ZX-Turbo he planned to drive last weekend in the Walter Mitty Challenge for historic cars at Road Atlanta in Braselton, Ga. When the car crashed, he broke his neck, left leg, left shoulder and right arm and sustained third-degree burns over 15 percent of his body. Doctors at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, where he was taken, said he died of complications from those injuries.
        Akin was one of three alternating drivers in the Porsche 935 that won at Sebring in 1979 and one of three in the winning Porsche 962 in 1986. His car's average speed of 115.82 miles an hour in 1986 remains the fastest ever at the Florida track.
        He raced six times in the world's best-known endurance race, the 24 Hours of Le Mans in France, finishing as high as fourth in 1984. In 1986, he won the International Motor Sports Association's world endurance championship.
        Akin's racing career started with dragsters in 1957, and he began road racing in 1959. He retired from professional racing in 1991 but stayed active in the sport. He raced vintage and historic cars, wrote magazine articles and did television commentary. His business, Bob Akin Motorsports in Ossining, N.Y., restores historic racecars and prepares them for competition.
        ''We were gentlemen racers together,'' said Paul Newman, the actor and a longtime driver. ''Bob was on the cutting edge of historic and vintage racing, which has become a huge sport.''
        Robert M. Akin III was born March 6, 1936, in North Tarrytown, N.Y., and was raised in Sleepy Hollow Manor. He was educated at Hackley School in Tarrytown and later served on its board for 30 years and as president from 1980 to 1990. At Columbia University, he earned a bachelor's degree in engineering and a master's degree in business administration.
        He spent 40 years with the Hudson Wire Company in Ossining and was president from 1974 until he retired in 1995. When the company, founded by his grandfather, was sold in 1989 to the Phelps Dodge Corporation, it dominated the worldwide aircraft and aerospace wiring market.
        Akin is survived by his wife of 42 years, Ellen; a son, Robert M. IV of Manhattan Beach, Calif.; two daughters, Susan of Sleepy Hollow and Johanna Stolecki of Cortlandt Manor, N.Y.; three grandchildren; and a brother, William of Montauk, N.Y.
