        In the spring of 1998, the chief financial officer of New Century Financial, a lender to home buyers with blemished credit, wrote an unusual paper describing a then little-known accounting technique.
        The executive, Edward F. Gotschall, marketed his white paper at industry seminars and conferences, and promoted it to Wall Street analysts as an insider's look at New Century, according to people who read the paper. New Century was at the time one of the nation's fastest-growing subprime lenders.
        Now that technique, called gain on sale, may be coming back to haunt the company, which filed for bankruptcy protection on April 2 after disclosing a month earlier that federal prosecutors and securities regulators were investigating accounting mistakes and stock sales at the company. The company is expected to file restated results for most of 2006 as early as this month.
        The technique promoted by Mr. Gotschall, who stepped down as chief financial officer in 2006 but continued as vice chairman of the board of directors, allowed the company to report profits before they actually existed. The paper profits were pegged to future earnings from loan sales to institutional investors.
        The results, which were nearly always prettier than those produced through traditional, conservative accounting in which profits were recorded only when cash comes through door, were then used to make more loans to risky home buyers.
        Used properly, gain on sale is legal. Big investment banks routinely employ the technique when packaging securities for sale to institutional investors.
        Unlike specialty finance lenders like New Century, though, Wall Street banks have deep pockets to support themselves if expected earnings from gain on sale accounting fail to materialize.
        But some financial analysts say that New Century appears to have also used gain on sale to hide losses as the subprime market began to falter late last year.
        A New Century spokeswoman declined to comment on the company's use of gain on sale accounting, citing the bankruptcy proceedings.
        The use of gain on sale was a factor in the collapse of Enron in 2001 and of major specialty lenders in the late 1990s through this decade. Conseco, a large insurance and finance company that made loans to subprime home buyers, filed for bankruptcy protection in 2002, one of the largest corporate bankruptcies ever.
        Critics say that the accounting technique remains ripe for abuse, even though federal accounting regulators tightened up the rules in the wake of Enron.
        ''The thing about gain on sale accounting is that you can create a machine that just manufactures earnings out of thin air,'' said Richard Benson, an expert on securitization and president of the Specialty Finance Group, a financial broker.
        The deterioration in recent months of the estimated $1.3 trillion subprime housing market has been tied to rising loan delinquencies and the decision by Wall Street to cut off billion-dollar credit lines to companies like New Century, which last year was the largest independent player in the industry.
        But Mr. Benson said that the stock prices of subprime home lenders like New Century Financial had ''collapsed so fast because the income and balance sheet had been built on gain on sale, which turns out to be imaginary.''
        ''The market woke up to the fact that there's no there there,'' Mr. Benson said.
        Other bankrupt or struggling subprime lenders that have used gain on sale accounting, or still do, include NovaStar Financial, Fieldstone Investment, Fremont General and Accredited Home Lenders, according to securities filings.
        New Century, of Irvine, Calif., made money in two ways, and it used gain on sale for both.
        In the first way, called ''whole loan sales,'' it sold pools of loans to big Wall Street investment banks. New Century made money by keeping the difference between the higher interest rates paid by subprime borrowers and the lower rates offered to the banks.
        In the second way, New Century chopped up its other loans to home buyers, repackaged them into securities for sale to investors, a process called securitization. New Century then kept the pieces expected to earn money in the future, called residuals, for itself.
        For both types of business, gain on sale allowed New Century to accelerate its profits. In 2005, the last year for which it has reported annual figures, New Century recorded income from gain on sale accounting of nearly $623 million out of a gross profit that year of $1.4 billion, according to its securities filings.
        For the whole loan sales, New Century recorded up front the cash gains.
        At the same time, New Century guaranteed to Wall Street investors that if the whole loans did not make as much money as it predicted -- if home buyers were late with or defaulted on payments -- New Century would buy back the impaired loans from the banks.
        But through overly rosy forecasts, New Century underestimated how many impaired loans it would have to repurchase and how much it would need to have on hand to do that.
        In its second use of gain on sale, New Century booked future earnings based on its estimates of what it expected to earn from the pieces left over from the securitizations.
        New Century's problem, according to Zach Gast, an analyst with the Center for Financial Research and Analysis, was how it used gain on sale for its whole loan business. In the late 1990s, in the last downturn for subprime lenders, most abuses of gain on sale involved the securitization side.
        At New Century Financial, ''it was aggressive accounting, that is certain,'' Mr. Gast said. ''But there are hints that New Century knew exactly how aggressive it was.''
        As the subprime market started to melt down last fall, New Century was forced to honor its guarantees to investment banks and other institutional investors and repurchase the impaired loans. It resold the loans at a loss.
        But, Mr. Gast said, when New Century repurchased the loans, it recorded them at values that exceeded the fire-sale prices. In other words, New Century did not recognize upfront the losses in the impaired loans.
        Mr. Gast said that New Century has ''a huge number of repurchased loans that they haven't taken losses on.'' Under gain on sale accounting rules, ''you should be recognizing the loss at the initial sale of the loan,'' Mr. Gast said, adding that if you underestimate potential losses, you have to recognize those losses when you are forced to repurchase the loans -- something New Century did not do.
        He called New Century's accounting ''creative.''
        The evidence for this, according to Mr. Gast, is in New Century's filing in February for the third quarter of last year. There, the lender disclosed for the first time that it had sold $242 million in loans for the period, but also repurchased $468 million in bad loans.
        New Century probably has at least $100 million in unreported pretax losses for the third quarter of last year, according to Mr. Gast's analysis. ''They still haven't reported this loss, which is why they're restating,'' he said.
        In its third-quarter 2006 filing, the company said that it would restate its earnings for the first nine months of 2006 and record a loss for the final quarter because it had understated the havoc wreaked by bad loans. Investors sent New Century's stock price plummeting.
        Mr. Gast said it was unclear what any potential losses for previous periods might be because New Century had not provided details in securities filings on loan repurchases for earlier periods.
        In his white paper, Mr. Gotschall, a co-founder of New Century, urged lenders to disclose more information about the assumptions and forecasts they used to predict future earnings.
        But New Century appears not to have followed that philosophy.
        Stephen Ryan, an accounting professor at New York University and an expert on securitization accounting, said that last year New Century had ''underestimated the allowance for repurchase losses, which means that they overstated the gain on sale.''
        ''They had had a history of doing so well previously, so it's a question of whether they didn't expect this or of something more nefarious on the part of senior management,'' Professor Ryan said.
        Correction:  May 10, 2007, Thursday  Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on May 1 about an accounting technique used by New Century Financial misstated the year that the company's chief financial officer, Edward F. Gotschall, stepped down from that job. It was 2004, not 2006. (Mr. Gotschall is still with the company as a vice chairman.)
